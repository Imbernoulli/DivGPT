        "To determine the total amount Joseph pays for the power used by the refrigerator, water heater, and electric oven, we start by defining the variables and using the given relationships between the costs.\n\nLet \\( w \\) be the amount Joseph pays for the power used by the water heater in a month. According to the problem, the amount he pays for the power used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater. Therefore, the amount he pays for the power used by the refrigerator is \\( 3w \\).\n\nWe are also given that the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, which is twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 500 = 2w \\]\n\nTo find \\( w \\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ w = \\frac{500}{2} = 250 \\]\n\nNow that we know \\( w = 250 \\), we can find the amount Joseph pays for the power used by the refrigerator:\n\\[ 3w = 3 \\times 250 = 750 \\]\n\nThe total amount Joseph pays for the power used by all three gadgets is the sum of the amounts he pays for the power used by the refrigerator, the water heater, and the electric oven:\n\\[ 750 + 250 + 500 = 1500 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Joseph pays for the power used by these gadgets is \\(\\boxed{1500}\\).",

According to the problem, the amount Joseph pays for the power used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater. Therefore, the amount Joseph pays for the power used by the refrigerator is \\( 3x \\) dollars.\n\nThe problem also states that the electric oven uses power worth $500 in a month, which is twice what Joseph pays for the power the water heater uses.

        "To determine the total amount Joseph pays for the power used by the refrigerator, water heater, and electric oven, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Let's denote the amount Joseph pays for the power used by the water heater as \\( x \\) dollars.\n2. According to the problem, the amount Joseph pays for the power used by the refrigerator is three times the amount he pays for the power used by the water heater.
