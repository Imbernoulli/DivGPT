        "To determine how much Tonya spent on paintbrushes, we need to calculate the total cost of all the other art supplies she purchased and subtract that from the total amount she spent.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the mixed set of paints:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of mixed set of paints} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 40.00 = 20.00\n\\]\n\nNext, we add up the costs of all the items she purchased:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of canvases} = 40.00\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of mixed set of paints} = 20.00\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of easel} = 15.00\n\\]\n\nNow, sum these amounts:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of canvases, paints, and easel} = 40.00 + 20.00 + 15.00 = 75.00\n\\]\n\nFinally, subtract the total cost of these items from the total amount Tonya spent to find out how much she spent on paintbrushes:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of paintbrushes} = 90.00 - 75.00 = 15.00\n\\]\n\nThus, Tonya spent \\(\\boxed{15}\\) dollars on paintbrushes.",
