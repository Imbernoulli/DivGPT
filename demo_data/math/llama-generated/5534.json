        "To determine the total number of cases of cat food sold, we need to calculate the number of cases bought by each group of customers and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. Calculate the number of cases bought by the first 8 customers:\n   - Each of the first 8 customers bought 3 cases.\n   - Therefore, the total number of cases bought by these customers is \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\).\n\n2. Calculate the number of cases bought by the next 4 customers:\n   - Each of the next 4 customers bought 2 cases.\n   - Therefore, the total number of cases bought by these customers is \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\).\n\n3. Calculate the number of cases bought by the last 8 customers:\n   - Each of the last 8 customers bought 1 case.\n   - Therefore, the total number of cases bought by these customers is \\(8 \\times 1 = 8\\).\n\n4. Sum the number of cases bought by all the customers:\n   - The total number of cases is \\(24 + 8 + 8 = 40\\).\n\nThus, the total number of cases of cat food sold is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
