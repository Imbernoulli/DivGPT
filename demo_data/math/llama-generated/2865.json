Each orange tree produces medium-sized oranges. At harvest time, Gabriela's grove produced 600 oranges per tree, while Alba harvested 400 per tree. Each of Maricela's trees produced 500 oranges. With such a huge harvest, the sisters are thinking of making orange juice for sale. If it takes three medium-sized oranges to make 1 cup of juice, and then they sell each cup for $4, how much money will they make?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how much money the Morales sisters will make from selling orange juice, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of oranges harvested from each sister's grove.\n2. Sum the total number of oranges harvested from all three groves.\n3. Determine the total number of cups of orange juice that can be made from the total number of oranges.\n4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the orange juice.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of oranges harvested from each sister's grove:\n- Gabriela's grove produced 600 oranges per tree and has 110 trees, so the total number of oranges from Gabriela's grove is:\n  \\[\n  600 \\times 110 = 66000\n  \\]\n- Alba's grove produced 400 oranges per tree and has 110 trees, so the total number of oranges from Alba's grove is:\n  \\[\n  400 \\times 110 = 44000\n  \\]\n- Maricela's grove produced 500 oranges per tree and has 110 trees, so the total number of oranges from Maricela's grove is:\n  \\[\n  500 \\times 110 = 55000\n  \\]\n\nNext, we sum the total number of oranges harvested from all three groves:\n\\[\n66000 + 44000 + 55000 = 165000\n\\]\n\nNow, we determine the total number of cups of orange juice that can be made from the total number of oranges. Since it takes three medium-sized oranges to make one cup of juice, the total number of cups of orange juice is:\n\\[\n\\frac{165000}{3} = 55000\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the orange juice. Since each cup of juice is sold for $4, the total revenue is:\n\\[\n55000 \\times 4 = 220000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money they will make is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{220000}\n\\]",

Determine the total number of cups of juice that can be made from the total number of oranges.\n4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cups of juice.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of oranges harvested from each sister's grove:\n\n- Gabriela's grove has 110 trees, and each tree produced 600 oranges. So, the total number of oranges from Gabriela's grove is:\n  \\[\n  110 \\times 600 = 66000\n  \\]\n\n- Alba's grove has 110 trees, and each tree produced 400 oranges. So, the total number of oranges from Alba's grove is:\n  \\[\n  110 \\times 400 = 44000\n  \\]\n\n- Maricela's grove has 110 trees, and each tree produced 500 oranges. So, the total number of oranges from Maricela's grove is:\n  \\[\n  110 \\times 500 = 55000\n  \\]\n\nNext, we sum the total number of oranges from all three groves:\n\\[\n66000 + 44000 + 55000 = 165000\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the total number of cups of juice that can be made from the total number of oranges. Since it takes three medium-sized oranges to make 1 cup of juice, the total number of cups of juice is:\n\\[\n\\frac{165000}{3} = 55000\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the cups of juice. Since each cup of juice is sold for $4, the total revenue is:\n\\[\n55000 \\times 4 = 220000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the Morales sisters will make is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{220000}\n\\]",

Calculate the total revenue from selling the cups of juice.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of oranges harvested by each sister:\n\n- Gabriela's grove produced 600 oranges per tree. Since she has 110 trees, the total number of oranges harvested by Gabriela is:\n  \\[\n  600 \\times 110 = 66000\n  \\]\n\n- Alba's grove produced 400 oranges per tree. Since she has 110 trees, the total number of oranges harvested by Alba is:\n  \\[\n  400 \\times 110 = 44000\n  \\]\n\n- Maricela's grove produced 500 oranges per tree. Since she has 110 trees, the total number of oranges harvested by Maricela is:\n  \\[\n  500 \\times 110 = 55000\n  \\]\n\nNext, we sum the total number of oranges harvested by all three sisters:\n\\[\n66000 + 44000 + 55000 = 165000\n\\]\n\nNow, we determine the total number of cups of juice that can be made from the total number of oranges. Since it takes three medium-sized oranges to make 1 cup of juice, the total number of cups of juice is:\n\\[\n\\frac{165000}{3} = 55000\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the cups of juice. Since each cup of juice is sold for $4, the total revenue is:\n\\[\n55000 \\times 4 = 220000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the Morales sisters will make is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{220000}\n\\]",
