We need to find 20% of the complaints when the store is short-staffed.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increase in complaints} = 160 \\times 0.20 = 32\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Complaints per day when self-checkout is broken} = 160 + 32 = 192\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of complaints over 3 days:**\n   Since the store was short-staffed and the self-checkout was broken for 3 days, we multiply the number of complaints per day by 3.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total complaints} = 192 \\times 3 = 576\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of complaints the store gets over the 3 days is \\(\\boxed{576}\\).",
