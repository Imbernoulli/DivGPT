        "To determine the total number of chapters Brian read, we will break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of chapters in the three initial books:\n- The first book has 20 chapters.\n- The second and third books each have 15 chapters.\n\nSo, the total number of chapters in these three books is:\n\\[\n20 + 15 + 15 = 50\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many chapters are in the fourth book. According to the problem, the fourth book has half the number of chapters of the three previous books put together. Since the total number of chapters in the three initial books is 50, the number of chapters in the fourth book is:\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{2} = 25\n\\]\n\nNow, add the number of chapters in all four books to find the total number of chapters Brian read:\n\\[\n20 + 15 + 15 + 25 = 75\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of chapters of books that Brian read is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{75}\n\\]",
