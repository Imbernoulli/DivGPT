The second floor has 3 rooms, and each room costs $20 per month. Therefore, the total rent from the second floor is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the rent from the third floor. The third floor has 3 rooms, but only 2 rooms are occupied. Each room on the third floor costs twice as much as the rooms on the first floor, which is $15 \\times 2 = $30 per month. Therefore, the total rent from the third floor is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the rents from all three floors to find out how much Krystiana earns every month:\n\\[ 45 + 60 + 60 = 165 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, Krystiana earns \\(\\boxed{165}\\) dollars every month."
