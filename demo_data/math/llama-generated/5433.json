        "To determine how many cookies Katrina has left to take home, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she sold throughout the day and subtract that from the initial number of cookies she had.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many cookies Katrina sold in the morning. She sold 3 dozen cookies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we calculate:\n\\[ 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\]\nSo, she sold 36 cookies in the morning.\n\nNext, we know she sold 57 cookies during the lunch rush. And in the afternoon, she sold 16 cookies. To find the total number of cookies sold, we add the cookies sold in the morning, during the lunch rush, and in the afternoon:\n\\[ 36 + 57 + 16 \\]\n\nLet's add these step by step:\n\\[ 36 + 57 = 93 \\]\n\\[ 93 + 16 = 109 \\]\nSo, the total number of cookies sold is 109.\n\nKatrina started with 120 cookies. To find out how many cookies she has left, we subtract the total number of cookies sold from the initial number of cookies:\n\\[ 120 - 109 = 11 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies Katrina has left to take home is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
