        "To determine the average number of dandelions picked by Billy and George, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of dandelions picked by George initially.\n2. Determine the total number of dandelions picked by Billy after he picks 10 more.\n3. Determine the total number of dandelions picked by George after he picks 10 more.\n4. Find the sum of the total dandelions picked by both Billy and George.\n5. Calculate the average number of dandelions picked by dividing the total by 2.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. George picks \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) as many dandelions as Billy. Since Billy picks 36 dandelions initially, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Dandelions picked by George initially} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 36 = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. Billy picks 10 more dandelions, so the total number of dandelions picked by Billy is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total dandelions picked by Billy} = 36 + 10 = 46\n   \\]\n\n3. George picks 10 more dandelions, so the total number of dandelions picked by George is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total dandelions picked by George} = 12 + 10 = 22\n   \\]\n\n4. The sum of the total dandelions picked by both Billy and George is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total dandelions picked} = 46 + 22 = 68\n   \\]\n\n5. The average number of dandelions picked is the total number of dandelions divided by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average number of dandelions picked} = \\frac{68}{2} = 34\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of dandelions picked by Billy and George is \\(\\boxed{34}\\).",
