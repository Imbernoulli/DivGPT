        "To determine how many women work in retail in Los Angeles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of women in Los Angeles.\n2. Determine how many of these women work in retail.\n\nFirst, we find the number of women in Los Angeles. Since half of the population is women, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of women} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6,000,000 = 3,000,000\n\\]\n\nNext, we find out how many of these women work in retail. Since one-third of the women work in retail, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of women working in retail} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 3,000,000 = 1,000,000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of women working in retail in Los Angeles is \\(\\boxed{1000000}\\).",

Therefore, we can find the number of women who work in retail by multiplying the number of women by 1/3:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of women working in retail} = 3,000,000 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 1,000,000\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of women who work in retail in Los Angeles is \\boxed{1000000}.",
