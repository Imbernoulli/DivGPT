        "To determine how much money Sally and Jolly have altogether, we need to find out how much money each of them has individually and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much money Sally has. According to the problem, if Sally had $20 less, she would have $80. This means that Sally's current amount of money is $80 plus $20. Therefore, we can calculate Sally's money as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Sally's money} = 80 + 20 = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find out how much money Jolly has. According to the problem, if Jolly had $20 more, she would have $70. This means that Jolly's current amount of money is $70 minus $20. Therefore, we can calculate Jolly's money as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Jolly's money} = 70 - 20 = 50\n\\]\n\nNow, we add Sally's money and Jolly's money to find out how much money they have altogether:\n\\[\n\\text{Total money} = \\text{Sally's money} + \\text{Jolly's money} = 100 + 50 = 150\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money that Sally and Jolly have altogether is \\boxed{150}.",
        "To determine how much money Sally and Jolly have altogether, we need to find out how much each of them has individually.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much money Sally has. According to the problem, if Sally had $20 less, she would have $80. This means that Sally's current amount of money is $20 more than $80. We can express this as:\n\\[ \\text{Sally's money} = 80 + 20 = 100 \\]\nSo, Sally has $100.\n\nNext, let's find out how much money Jolly has.
