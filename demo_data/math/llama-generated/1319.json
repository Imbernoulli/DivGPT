        "To determine the total number of pies eaten in the pie-eating contest, we need to find out how many pies each contestant ate and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we know that Sierra ate 12 pies. According to the problem, Sierra eats twice as many pies as Bill. Therefore, we can find out how many pies Bill ate by dividing Sierra's total by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pies Bill ate} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Adam eats three more pies than Bill. So, we can find out how many pies Adam ate by adding 3 to the number of pies Bill ate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pies Adam ate} = 6 + 3 = 9\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of pies eaten by Adam, Bill, and Sierra to find the total number of pies eaten:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of pies eaten} = \\text{Number of pies Adam ate} + \\text{Number of pies Bill ate} + \\text{Number of pies Sierra ate} = 9 + 6 + 12 = 27\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pies eaten is \\boxed{27}.",

        "To determine the total number of pies eaten in the pie-eating contest, we need to find out how many pies each participant ate and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Determine how many pies Bill ate:**\n   Sierra ate 12 pies, and she ate twice as many pies as Bill.
