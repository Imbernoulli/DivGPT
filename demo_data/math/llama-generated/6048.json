        "To determine how many pies Milton sold during the weekend, we need to calculate the number of apple pies and peach pies sold separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of apple pies sold:\n- Each apple pie is cut into 8 slices.\n- 56 customers ordered apple pie slices.\n\nTo find the number of apple pies sold, we divide the total number of apple pie slices ordered by the number of slices per apple pie:\n\\[\n\\frac{56 \\text{ slices}}{8 \\text{ slices per pie}} = 7 \\text{ apple pies}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of peach pies sold:\n- Each peach pie is cut into 6 slices.\n- 48 customers ordered peach pie slices.\n\nTo find the number of peach pies sold, we divide the total number of peach pie slices ordered by the number of slices per peach pie:\n\\[\n\\frac{48 \\text{ slices}}{6 \\text{ slices per pie}} = 8 \\text{ peach pies}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the number of apple pies and peach pies sold to find the total number of pies sold during the weekend:\n\\[\n7 \\text{ apple pies} + 8 \\text{ peach pies} = 15 \\text{ pies}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of pies Milton sold during the weekend is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
