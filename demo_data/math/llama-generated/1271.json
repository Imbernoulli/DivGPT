        "To find the combined number of degrees Summer and Jolly have, we start by determining how many degrees Jolly has. We know that Summer has 150 degrees and five more degrees than Jolly. Let's denote the number of degrees Jolly has as \\( j \\). According to the problem, we can express the number of degrees Summer has as \\( j + 5 \\). Since we know Summer has 150 degrees, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ j + 5 = 150 \\]\n\nTo find \\( j \\), we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ j = 150 - 5 \\]\n\\[ j = 145 \\]\n\nSo, Jolly has 145 degrees. Now, we need to find the combined number of degrees Summer and Jolly have. We do this by adding the number of degrees Summer has to the number of degrees Jolly has:\n\n\\[ 150 + 145 = 295 \\]\n\nTherefore, the combined number of degrees they both have is \\(\\boxed{295}\\).",

Since we know Summer has 150 degrees, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ J + 5 = 150 \\]\n\nTo find \\( J \\), we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ J = 150 - 5 \\]\n\\[ J = 145 \\]\n\nSo, Jolly has 145 degrees. Now, we need to find the combined number of degrees both Summer and Jolly have. We do this by adding Summer's degrees and Jolly's degrees together:\n\n\\[ 150 + 145 = 295 \\]\n\nTherefore, the combined number of degrees they both have is \\(\\boxed{295}\\).",
