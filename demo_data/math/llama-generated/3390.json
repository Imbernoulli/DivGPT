        "First, we need to determine the total cost of the peaches before any discounts are applied.

The store offers a $2 discount for every $10 purchase. To find out how many $10 increments are in $160, we divide $160 by $10:\n\n\\[\n\\$160 \\div \\$10 = 16\n\\]\n\nSince the store gives a $2 discount for each $10 purchase, the total discount is:\n\n\\[\n16 \\times \\$2 = \\$32\n\\]\n\nTo find the total amount of money Kataleya paid after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original total cost:\n\n\\[\n\\$160 - \\$32 = \\$128\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Kataleya paid at the store for the fruits is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{128}\n\\]",

Therefore, the total cost is:\n\n\\[ 400 \\times 0.40 = 160 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the discount Kataleya receives. The store offers a $2 discount for every $10 purchase. To find out how many $10 increments are in $160, we divide $160 by $10:\n\n\\[ 160 \\div 10 = 16 \\]\n\nSince the store offers a $2 discount for each $10 increment, the total discount is:\n\n\\[ 16 \\times 2 = 32 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTo find the final amount Kataleya paid, we subtract the discount from the original total cost:\n\n\\[ 160 - 32 = 128 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Kataleya paid at the store for the fruits is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{128} \\]",

Determine the discount based on the total cost.\n3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches before the discount. The peaches are sold at forty cents each, and Kataleya bought 400 peaches. So, the total cost is:\n\\[\n400 \\text{ peaches} \\times 0.40 \\text{ dollars/peach} = 160 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the discount.
