        "To determine how much John saves per year by splitting the apartment with his two brothers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the new apartment.\n2. Determine John's share of the new apartment cost.\n3. Calculate John's annual cost for the new apartment.\n4. Calculate John's annual cost for his old apartment.\n5. Find the difference between John's annual cost for the old apartment and his annual cost for the new apartment.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the new apartment.\n   The new apartment is 40% more expensive than John's old apartment. John's old apartment costs $1200 per month.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of the new apartment} = 1200 + 0.40 \\times 1200 = 1200 + 480 = 1680 \\text{ dollars per month}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine John's share of the new apartment cost.\n   Since John and his two brothers are splitting the cost equally, there are three people in total.\n   \\[\n   \\text{John's share} = \\frac{1680}{3} = 560 \\text{ dollars per month}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate John's annual cost for the new apartment.\n   There are 12 months in a year.\n   \\[\n   \\text{John's annual cost for the new apartment} = 560 \\times 12 = 6720 \\text{ dollars per year}\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate John's annual cost for his old apartment.\n   John's old apartment costs $1200 per month.\n   \\[\n   \\text{John's annual cost for the old apartment} = 1200 \\times 12 = 14400 \\text{ dollars per year}\n   \\]\n\n5. Find the difference between John's annual cost for the old apartment and his annual cost for the new apartment.\n   \\[\n   \\text{John's savings per year} = 14400 - 6720 = 7680 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, John saves \\(\\boxed{7680}\\) dollars per year by splitting the apartment with his two brothers.",

Therefore, the cost of the new apartment per month is:\n\\[\n1200 + 0.40 \\times 1200 = 1200 + 480 = 1680\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine John's share of the cost of the new apartment.**\n\nJohn and his two brothers are splitting the cost of the new apartment. This means there are three people sharing the cost. Therefore, John's share of the cost per month is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1680}{3} = 560\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate John's annual cost for the new apartment.**\n\nTo find John's annual cost for the new apartment, we multiply his monthly cost by 12:\n\\[\n560 \\times 12 = 6720\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate John's annual cost for his old apartment.**\n\nTo find John's annual cost for his old apartment, we multiply his monthly cost by 12:\n\\[\n1200 \\times 12 = 14400\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Find the difference between John's annual cost for his old apartment and his annual cost for the new apartment.**\n\nTo find out how much John saves per year by splitting the apartment compared to living alone, we subtract his annual cost for the new apartment from his annual cost for the old apartment:\n\\[\n14400 - 6720 = 7680\n\\]\n\nTherefore, John saves \\(\\boxed{7680}\\) dollars per year by splitting the apartment compared to living alone.",
