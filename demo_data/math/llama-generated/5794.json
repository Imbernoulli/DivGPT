The computer table costs $140, the computer chair costs $100, and the joystick costs $20. Eman agreed to pay for the computer chair while Frank agreed to pay for the computer table. Then Frank agreed to pay 1/4 of the price of the joystick and the rest will be paid by Eman. How much more money will Frank spend than Eman?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
