        "To determine how much money John makes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of caterpillars John has.\n2. Determine how many of these caterpillars become butterflies.\n3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the butterflies.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of caterpillars.**\n\nJohn has 4 jars, each containing 10 caterpillars. Therefore, the total number of caterpillars is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 10 = 40\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many caterpillars become butterflies.**\n\n40% of the caterpillars fail to become butterflies. Thus, 60% of them do become butterflies. We calculate 60% of 40:\n\\[\n0.60 \\times 40 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, 24 caterpillars become butterflies.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the butterflies.**\n\nJohn sells each butterfly for $3. Therefore, the total revenue is:\n\\[\n24 \\times 3 = 72\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money John makes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{72}\n\\]",

Calculate the total revenue from selling the butterflies.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of caterpillars John has. He has 4 jars, each containing 10 caterpillars:\n\\[\n4 \\times 10 = 40\n\\]\nSo, John has 40 caterpillars in total.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many caterpillars fail to become butterflies. Since 40% of the caterpillars fail, we calculate 40% of 40:\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 40 = 16\n\\]\nSo, 16 caterpillars fail to become butterflies. This means the number of caterpillars that do become butterflies is:\n\\[\n40 - 16 = 24\n\\]\nSo, John creates 24 butterflies.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the butterflies. Since each butterfly is sold for $3, the total revenue is:\n\\[\n24 \\times 3 = 72\n\\]\nSo, the total amount of money John makes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{72}\n\\]",
