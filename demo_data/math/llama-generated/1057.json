        "To determine the total number of sticks of wax Loraine used to make all the animals, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of small animals:**\n   Loraine used 12 sticks of wax for small animals. Since each small animal takes 2 sticks of wax, we can calculate the number of small animals by dividing the total number of sticks used for small animals by the number of sticks per small animal:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of small animals} = \\frac{12 \\text{ sticks}}{2 \\text{ sticks/animal}} = 6 \\text{ small animals}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of large animals:**\n   Loraine made three times as many small animals as large animals. Let \\( L \\) represent the number of large animals. According to the problem:\n   \\[\n   3L = 6\n   \\]\n   To find \\( L \\), we solve for \\( L \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\text{ large animals}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of sticks of wax used for large animals:**\n   Each large animal takes 4 sticks of wax. Therefore, the total number of sticks used for large animals is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sticks for large animals} = 2 \\text{ large animals} \\times 4 \\text{ sticks/animal} = 8 \\text{ sticks}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of sticks of wax used for all the animals:**\n   Add the sticks used for small animals and the sticks used for large animals:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total sticks of wax} = 12 \\text{ sticks (small animals)} + 8 \\text{ sticks (large animals)} = 20 \\text{ sticks}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of sticks of wax Loraine used to make all the animals is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of sticks of wax Loraine used to make all the animals, we start by finding out how many small animals she made. We know that she used 12 sticks of wax for small animals, and each small animal takes 2 sticks of wax. Therefore, the number of small animals she made is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of small animals} = \\frac{12 \\text{ sticks}}{2 \\text{ sticks per small animal}} = 6 \\text{ small animals}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Loraine made three times as many small animals as large animals. Let \\( L \\) be the number of large animals she made. Then, we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of small animals} = 3 \\times L\n\\]\n\nSince we already know that the number of small animals is 6, we can substitute 6 for the number of small animals in the equation:\n\n\\[\n6 = 3 \\times L\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( L \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nL = \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\text{ large animals}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of sticks of wax used for the large animals. Since each large animal takes 4 sticks of wax, the total number of sticks of wax used for the large animals is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sticks of wax for large animals} = 2 \\text{ large animals} \\times 4 \\text{ sticks per large animal} = 8 \\text{ sticks}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of sticks of wax used for the small animals and the number of sticks of wax used for the large animals to find the total number of sticks of wax used:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total sticks of wax} = 12 \\text{ sticks} + 8 \\text{ sticks} = 20 \\text{ sticks}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of sticks of wax Loraine used to make all the animals is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",
