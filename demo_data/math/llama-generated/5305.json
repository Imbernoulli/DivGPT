        "To determine how much Tommy needs to save up, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 8 books. Since each book costs $5, the total cost is:\n\n\\[ 8 \\text{ books} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/book} = 40 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much more money Tommy needs by subtracting the amount of money he already has from the total cost. Tommy already has $13, so we subtract this from $40:\n\n\\[ 40 \\text{ dollars} - 13 \\text{ dollars} = 27 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Tommy needs to save up \\(\\boxed{27}\\) dollars.",
