        "To determine the total number of nephews Alden and Vihaan have now, we start by finding out how many nephews Alden has currently.\n\nWe know that ten years ago, Alden had 50 nephews. According to the problem, this number is half the number of nephews Alden has now. Let \\( x \\) be the number of nephews Alden has now. We can set up the following equation based on the information given:\n\n\\[\n50 = \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = 50 \\times 2 = 100\n\\]\n\nSo, Alden now has 100 nephews.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many nephews Vihaan has. The problem states that Vihaan has 60 more nephews than Alden now. Therefore, the number of nephews Vihaan has is:\n\n\\[\n100 + 60 = 160\n\\]\n\nTo find the total number of nephews Alden and Vihaan have together, we add the number of nephews Alden has to the number of nephews Vihaan has:\n\n\\[\n100 + 160 = 260\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of nephews Alden and Vihaan have altogether is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{260}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of nephews Alden and Vihaan have now, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of nephews Alden had ten years ago.\n   Alden had 50 nephews ten years ago.\n\n2. Determine the number of nephews Alden has now.\n   According to the problem, the number of nephews Alden had ten years ago is half the number of nephews Alden has now. Let's denote the number of nephews Alden has now as \\( A \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   50 = \\frac{A}{2}\n   \\]\n   To find \\( A \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n   \\[\n   A = 50 \\times 2 = 100\n   \\]\n   So, Alden has 100 nephews now.\n\n3. Determine the number of nephews Vihaan has now.\n   Vihaan has 60 more nephews than Alden. Since Alden has 100 nephews now, Vihaan has:\n   \\[\n   100 + 60 = 160\n   \\]\n   So, Vihaan has 160 nephews now.\n\n4.
