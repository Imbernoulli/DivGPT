        "Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Wendy paid for the tooth extraction.\n\nFirst, we know the following:\n- The cost of a cleaning is $70.\n- The cost of a filling is $120.\n- Wendy's dentist bill was five times the cost of a filling.\n- Wendy had a cleaning, two fillings, and a tooth extraction.\n\nLet's calculate the cost of the cleaning and the fillings:\n- The cost of the cleaning is $70.\n- The cost of two fillings is \\(2 \\times 120 = 240\\) dollars.\n\nSo, the total cost of the cleaning and the fillings is:\n\\[70 + 240 = 310\\] dollars.\n\nLet's denote the cost of the tooth extraction as \\(x\\). According to the problem, Wendy's totaloth bill was five times the cost of a filling. Since the cost of a filling is $120, five times the cost of a filling is:\n\\[5 \\times 120 = 600\\] dollars.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the cleaning, the fillings, and the tooth extraction is equal to $600. We can set up the following equation:\n\\[310 + x = 600\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we subtract 310 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[x = 600 - 310 = 290\\]\n\nSo, Wendy paid \\(\\boxed{290}\\) dollars for the tooth extraction.",
        "Let's start by calculating the cost of the cleaning and the fillings. The dentist charges $70 for a cleaning and $120 for each filling. Wendy had two fillings, so the cost for the fillings is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 120 = 240 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we add the cost of the cleaning to the cost of the fillings:\n\\[ 70 + 240 = 310 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nLet \\( E \\) be the cost of the tooth extraction. According to the problem, Wendy's total dental bill was five times the cost of a filling. Since the cost of a filling is $120, five times this amount is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 120 = 600 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total dental bill is the sum of the cost of the cleaning, the cost of the fillings, and the cost of the tooth extraction. We can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 310 + E = 600 \\]\n\nTo find the cost of the tooth extraction, we solve for \\( E \\) by subtracting 310 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ E = 600 - 310 = 290 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the tooth extraction is:\n\\[ \\boxed{290} \\]",
