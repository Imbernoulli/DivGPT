        "To determine the total number of crayons, we need to calculate the number of crayons in each color category and then sum them up.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of orange crayons:\n   - There are 6 boxes of orange crayons.\n   - Each box contains 8 orange crayons.\n   - Therefore, the total number of orange crayons is \\(6 \\times 8 = 48\\).\n\n2. Calculate the total number of blue crayons:\n   - There are 7 boxes of blue crayons.\n   - Each box contains 5 blue crayons.\n   - Therefore, the total number of blue crayons is \\(7 \\times 5 = 35\\).\n\n3. Calculate the total number of red crayons:\n   - There is 1 box of red crayons.\n   - Each box contains 11 red crayons.\n   - Therefore, the total number of red crayons is \\(1 \\times 11 = 11\\).\n\n4.
