        "To determine how much water will be left in the pool after 3 hours, we need to calculate the net rate at which the water level changes due to the drain and the hose.\n\nFirst, we find the rate at which the drain empties the pool. The drain can empty the pool in 4 hours, so the rate of emptying is:\n\\[\n\\frac{120 \\text{ liters}}{4 \\text{ hours}} = 30 \\text{ liters per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the rate at which the hose fills the pool. The hose can fill the pool in 6 hours, so the rate of filling is:\n\\[\n\\frac{120 \\text{ liters}}{6 \\text{ hours}} = 20 \\text{ liters per hour}\n\\]\n\nThe net rate at which the water level changes is the difference between the rate of filling and the rate of emptying:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ liters per hour} - 30 \\text{ liters per hour} = -10 \\text{ liters per hour}\n\\]\n\nThis means that the pool is losing water at a rate of 10 liters per hour.

After losing 30 liters, the amount of water left in the pool is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Water left} = 120 \\text{ liters} - 30 \\text{ liters} = 90 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of water left in the pool after 3 hours is \\boxed{90}.",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the rate at which the drain empties the pool:**\n   The drain can empty the pool in 4 hours. Therefore, the rate at which the drain empties the pool is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ contrôle rate of drain} = \\frac{120 \\text{ liters}}{4 \\text{ hours}} = 30 \\text{ liters per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the rate at which the hose fills the pool:**\n   The hose can fill the pool in 6 hours. Therefore, the rate at which the hose fills the pool is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{rate of hose} = \\frac{120 \\text{ liters}}{6 \\text{ hours}} = 20 \\text{ liters per hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the net rate of change in the water level:**\n   The net rate of change in the water level is the difference between the rate at which the hose fills the pool and the rate at which the drain empties the pool:\n   \\[\n   \\text{net rate} = 20 \\text{ liters per hour} - 30 \\text{ liters per hour} = -10 \\text{ liters per hour}\n   \\]\n   This negative rate indicates that the water level is decreasing by 10 liters per hour.\n\n4. **Calculate the total change in the water level after 3 hours:**\n   Since the net rate of change is -10 liters per hour, the total change in the water level after 3 hours is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{total change} = -10 \\text{ liters per hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = -30 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n   This means that the water level decreases by 30 liters after 3 hours.\n\n5. **Determine the amount of water left in the pool after 3 hours:**\n   The pool starts with 120 liters of water. After 3 hours, the amount of water left in the pool is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{water left} = 120 \\text{ liters} - 30 \\text{ liters} = 90 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of water left in the pool after 3 hours is \\(\\boxed{90}\\) liters.",
