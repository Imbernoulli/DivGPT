        "To determine how many ounces of milk the shopkeeper bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total volume of milk in milliliters.\n2. Convert the total volume from milliliters to fluid ounces.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total volume of milk in milliliters.**\n\nThe shopkeeper bought 150 packets of milk, and each packet contains 250 ml of milk.

Therefore, the total volume of milk is:\n\\[\n150 \\text{ packets} \\times 250 \\text{ ml/packet} = 37500 \\text{ ml}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the total volume from milliliters to fluid ounces. We know that 1 fluid ounce is equal to 30 ml. So, to find out how many fluid ounces are in 37500 ml, we divide 37500 ml by 30 ml/fluid ounce:\n\\[\n37500 \\text{ ml} \\div 30 \\text{ ml/fluid ounce} = 1250 \\text{ fluid ounces}\n\\]\n\nThus, the shopkeeper bought \\boxed{1250} ounces of milk.",
