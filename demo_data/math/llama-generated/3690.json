First, we calculate the total number of jumps Hattie did:\n\\[\n\\text{Hattie's total jumps} = 180 + 120 = 300\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total number of jumps Lorelei did:\n\\[\n\\text{Lorelei's total jumps} = 135 + 170 = 305\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the total jumps of Hattie and Lorelei to get the overall total:\n\\[\n\\text{Total jumps} = 300 + 305 = 605\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of jumps the two did in the two rounds is \\(\\boxed{605}\\).",
