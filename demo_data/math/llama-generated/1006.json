        "To determine how many pounds of honey Penny has purchased and how much her purchase exceeds the minimum spend, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost before tax:**\n   Penny paid $240 in total, and the tax rate is $1 per pound. Let \\( p \\) represent the number of pounds of honey Penny bought. The total cost before tax is \\( 5p \\) dollars (since the price per pound is $5), and the tax is \\( p \\) dollars. Therefore, the equation for the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   5p + p = 240\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   6p = 240\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( p \\), we divide both sides by 6:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{240}{6} = 40\n   \\]\n   So, Penny has bought 40 pounds of honey.\n\n2. **Determine the minimum spend in pounds:**\n   The minimum spend before tax is $40, and since the price per pound is $5, the minimum spend in pounds is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{5} = 8 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how much Penny's purchase exceeds the minimum spend:**\n   Penny has bought 40 pounds of honey, and the minimum spend is 8 pounds.

The total amount Penny paid is $240, and the tax is $1 per pound. Therefore, if we let \\( w \\) be the weight of the honey in pounds, the total cost of the honey before tax is \\( w \\times 5 \\) dollars.
