        "To determine the total number of books Tara sells, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate half of Tara's goal:**\n   Tara's goal is to save $90. Half of this amount is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many books Tara needs to sell to reach half her goal:**\n   Tara starts with $10 and sells each book for $5. To find out how many books she needs to sell to reach $45, we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   10 + 5x = 45\n   \\]\n   Subtract 10 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   5x = 35\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 5:\n   \\[\n   x = 7\n   \\]\n   So, Tara needs to sell 7 books to reach halfway towards her goal.\n\n3. **Account for the loss of all savings:**\n   Tara loses all her savings when she reaches halfway, so she starts over with $0.\n\n4. **Determine how many books Tara needs to sell to reach her original goal from scratch:**\n   Tara now needs to save the full $90. Since she sells each book for $5, we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   5y = 90\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 5:\n   \\[\n   y = 18\n   \\]\n   So, Tara needs to sell 18 books to reach her original goal.\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of books sold:**\n   Tara sells 7 books to reach halfway and then sells 18 books to reach her original goal. The total number of books she sells is:\n   \\[\n   7 + 18 = 25\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of books Tara sells by the time she reaches her goal is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
