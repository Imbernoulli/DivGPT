The speed of the Zargon Destroyer in normal space is 2 billion miles per hour, and it travels for 7 hours. The distance traveled in normal space is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance in normal space} = \\text{Speed in normal space} \\times \\text{Time in normal space} = 2 \\, \\text{billion miles per hour} \\times 7 \\, \\text{hours} = 14 \\, \\text{billion miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance traveled through a black hole. The speed of the Zargon Destroyer through a black hole is three times the speed in normal space, which is:\n\\[\n\\text{Speed through a black hole} = 3 \\times 2 \\, \\text{billion miles per hour} = 6 \\, \\text{billion miles per hour}\n\\]\nThe Zargon Destroyer travels through a black hole for 2 hours. The distance traveled through a black hole is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance through a black hole} = \\text{Speed through a black hole} \\times \\text{Time through a black hole} = 6 \\, \\text{billion miles per hour} \\times 2 \\, \\text{hours} = 12 \\, \\text{billion miles}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the distances traveled in normal space and through a black hole to get the total distance traveled:\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = \\text{Distance in normal space} + \\text{Distance through a black hole} = 14 \\, \\text{billion miles} + 12 \\, \\text{billion miles} = 26 \\, \\text{billion miles}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total distance traveled by the Zargon Destroyer is \\(\\boxed{26}\\) billion miles."
