Mike manages to print as fast as 600 pamphlets per hour for 9 consecutive hours. After a break, he resumes the task for another 2 hours achieving a third of the speed he was doing before. Leo, on the other hand, only works a third as many hours as Mike did before his break, but was twice as fast as Mike before he took his break.

        "To determine the total number of pamphlets printed by Mike and Leo, we need to calculate the number of pamphlets each of them prints separately and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pamphlets Mike prints:\n1.

Leo works a third as many hours as Mike did before his break.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9 \\text{ hours}}{3} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n2. Leo prints at a speed that is twice as fast as Mike before he took his break.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 600 \\text{ pamphlets/hour} = 1200 \\text{ pamphlets/hour}\n   \\]\n3. The total number of pamphlets Leo prints is:\n   \\[\n   1200 \\text{ pamphlets/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 3600 \\text{ pamphlets}\n   \\]\n\nFinally, the total number of pamphlets printed by both Mike and Leo is:\n\\[\n5800 \\text{ pamphlets} + 3600 \\text{ pamphlets} = 9400 \\text{ pamphlets}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of pamphlets printed by Mike and Leo is \\(\\boxed{9400}\\).",

Mike prints at a speed of 600 pamphlets per hour for 9 consecutive hours.\n   \\[\n   600 \\text{ pamphlets/hour} \\times 9 \\text{ hours} = 5400 \\text{ pamphlets}\n   \\]\n2. After a break, Mike resumes the task for another 2 hours at a speed of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of his original speed.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 600 \\text{ pamphlets/hour} = 200 \\text{ pamphlets/hour}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   200 \\text{ pamphlets/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 400 \\text{ pamphlets}\n   \\]\n3. The total number of pamphlets Mike prints is:\n   \\[\n   5400 \\text{ pamphlets} + 400 \\text{ pamphlets} = 5800 \\text{ pamphlets}\n   \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of pamphlets Leo prints:\n1. Leo works a third as many hours as Mike did before his break. Mike worked 9 hours before his break, so Leo works:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n2. Leo prints at a speed of twice as fast as Mike before he took his break.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 600 \\text{ pamphlets/hour} = 1200 \\text{ pamphlets/hour}\n   \\]\n3. The total number of pamphlets Leo prints is:\n   \\[\n   1200 \\text{ pamphlets/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 3600 \\text{ pamphlets}\n   \\]\n\nFinally, the total number of pamphlets printed by both Mike and Leo is:\n\\[\n5800 \\text{ pamphlets} + 3600 \\text{ pamphlets} = 9400 \\text{ pamphlets}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of pamphlets printed by both Mike and Leo is \\(\\boxed{9400}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of pamphlets printed by Mike and Leo, we need to calculate the number of pamphlets each of them prints individually and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pamphlets Mike prints. Mike prints at a speed of 600 pamphlets per hour for 9 consecutive hours:\n\\[\n600 \\text{ pamphlets/hour} \\times 9 \\text{ hours} = 5400 \\text{ pamphlets}\n\\]\nAfter a break, Mike resumes printing for another 2 hours at a speed that is a third of his original speed:\n\\[\n\\frac{600 \\text{ pamphlets/hour}}{3} = 200 \\text{ pamphlets/hour}\n\\]\nSo, the number of pamphlets he prints in the additional 2 hours is:\n\\[\n200 \\text{ pamphlets/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 400 \\text{ pamphlets}\n\\]\nAdding the pamphlets printed before and after the break, the total number of pamphlets Mike prints is:\n\\[\n5400 \\text{ pamphlets} + 400 \\text{ pamphlets} = 5800 \\text{ pamphlets}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of pamphlets Leo prints. Leo works a third as many hours as Mike did before his break. Since Mike worked 9 hours before his break, Leo works:\n\\[\n\\frac{9 \\text{ hours}}{3} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nLeo prints at a speed that is twice as fast as Mike before he took his break:\n\\[\n2 \\times 600 \\text{ pamphlets/hour} = 1200 \\text{ pamphlets/hour}\n\\]\nSo, the number of pamphlets Leo prints in 3 hours is:\n\\[\n1200 \\text{ pamphlets/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 3600 \\text{ pamphlets}\n\\]\n\nAdding the number of pamphlets printed by Mike and Leo, the total number of pamphlets printed by both is:\n\\[\n5800 \\text{ pamphlets} + 3600 \\text{ pamphlets} = 9400 \\text{ pamphlets}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pamphlets printed by Mike and Leo is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9400}\n\\]"
