        "To determine how many pieces of clothing Amara has remaining, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial number of clothes**: Amara starts with 100 pieces of clothing.\n\n2. **Donation to the first orphanage**: She donates 5 pieces of clothing.\n   \\[\n   100 - 5 = 95\n   \\]\n   After this donation, Amara has 95 pieces of clothing left.\n\n3. **Donation to the second orphanage**: She donates triple the amount she donated to the first orphanage. Since she donated 5 pieces to the first orphanage, she donates:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n   Subtracting this from the remaining clothes:\n   \\[\n   95 - 15 = 80\n   \\]\n   After this donation, Amara has 80 pieces of clothing left.\n\n4. **Throwing away old clothes**: She decides to throw away 15 pieces of her old clothes.\n   \\[\n   80 - 15 = 65\n   \\]\n   After throwing away the old clothes, Amara has 65 pieces of clothing left.\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of clothing Amara has remaining is \\(\\boxed{65}\\).",
        "To determine how many pieces of clothing Amara has remaining, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of clothes donated.\n2. Subtract the donated clothes and the thrown away clothes from the initial number of clothes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of clothes donated. Amara donated 5 pieces to one orphanage home and triple that amount to another orphanage home. So, she donated \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\) pieces to the second orphanage home. The total number of clothes donated is:\n\\[5 + 15 = 20\\]\n\nNext, we need to subtract the donated clothes and the thrown away clothes from the initial number of clothes. Amara initially had 100 pieces of clothing, donated 20 pieces, and threw away 15 pieces. So, the total number of clothes removed from her initial count is:\n\\[20 + 15 = 35\\]\n\nSubtracting this from the initial number of clothes, we get:\n\\[100 - 35 = 65\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of clothing Amara has remaining is:\n\\[\\boxed{65}\\]",

Therefore, the total number of pieces of clothing given away (donated and thrown away) is:\n\\[ 20 + 15 = 35 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of pieces given away from the original number of pieces of clothing. Amara originally had 100 pieces of clothing. So, the number of pieces remaining is:\n\\[ 100 - 35 = 65 \\]\n\nThus, the number of pieces of clothing Amara has remaining is:\n\\[ \\boxed{65} \\]",
        "To determine how many pieces of clothing Amara has remaining, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of clothes donated to the second orphanage home.\n2. Determine the total number of clothes donated to both orphanage homes.\n3. Add the number of clothes thrown away to the total number of clothes donated.\n4. Subtract the total number of clothes donated and thrown away from the original number of clothes.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Amara donated 5 pieces of clothing to the first orphanage home. She donated triple that amount to the second orphanage home. Therefore, the number of clothes donated to the second orphanage home is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. The total number of clothes donated to both orphanage homes is:\n   \\[\n   5 + 15 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. Amara also decides to throw away 15 pieces of her old clothes. Therefore, the total number of clothes donated and thrown away is:\n   \\[\n   20 + 15 = 35\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, we subtract the total number of clothes donated and thrown away from the original number of clothes to find out how many pieces of clothing Amara has remaining:\n   \\[\n   100 - 35 = 65\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of pieces of clothing Amara has remaining is \\boxed{65}.",

Subtract the total number of pieces of clothing donated and the number of pieces thrown away from the original number of pieces of clothing.\n\nFirst, we know that Amara donated 5 pieces of clothing to one orphanage home.
