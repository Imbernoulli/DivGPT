        "First, we need to determine how much Lyn donates to the community pantry project. Since 1/3 of the $240 goes to the community pantry project, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 240 = 80\n\\]\nSo, $80 goes to the community pantry project.\n\nNext, we calculate how much goes to the local crisis fund. Since 1/2 of the $240 goes to the local crisis fund, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 240 = 120\n\\]\nSo, $120 goes to the local crisis fund.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much money is left after donating to the community pantry project and the local crisis fund. We subtract the amounts donated to these two projects from the total donation:\n\\[\n240 - 80 - 120 = 40\n\\]\nSo, $40 is left to be donated to the livelihood project funds and the contingency funds.
