        "To determine how many more minutes Joan has to spend on each question in the Math exam compared to the English exam, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the time Joan spends on each question in the English exam.\n2. Calculate the time Joan spends on each question in the Math exam.\n3. Find the difference in time spent per question between the Math exam and the English exam.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Joan spends on each question in the English exam. The English exam has 30 questions and is to be completed in 1 hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time spent per question is:\n\\[\n\\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{30 \\text{ questions}} = 2 \\text{ minutes per question}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Joan spends on each question in the Math exam. The Math exam has 15 questions and is to be completed in 1.5 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 1.5 hours is equal to:\n\\[\n1.5 \\times 60 = 90 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nSo, the time spent per question is:\n\\[\n\\frac{90 \\text{ minutes}}{15 \\text{ questions}} = 6 \\text{ minutes per question}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in time spent per question between the Math exam and the English exam:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ minutes per question} - 2 \\text{ minutes per question} = 4 \\text{ minutes per question}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Joan has \\(\\boxed{4}\\) more minutes to spend on each question on the Math exam than the English exam.",
        "To determine how many more minutes Joan has in answering each question on the Math exam compared to the English exam, we first need to calculate the time spent on each question for both exams.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the time spent on each question for the English exam.**\n\nThe English exam has 30 questions and is to be completed in 1 hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the time spent on each question as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Time per question for English exam} = \\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{30 \\text{ questions}} = 2 \\text{ minutes per question}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the time spent on each question for the Math exam.**\n\nThe Math exam has 15 questions and is to be completed in 1.5 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 1.5 hours is equivalent to:\n\\[\n1.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 90 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nWe can calculate the time spent on each question as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Time per question for Math exam} = \\frac{90 \\text{ minutes}}{15 \\text{ questions}} = 6 \\text{ minutes per question}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the difference in time spent on each question between the Math exam and the English exam.**\n\nThe difference in time spent on each question is:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Time per question for Math exam} - \\text{Time per question for English exam} = 6 \\text{ minutes per question} - 2 \\text{ minutes per question} = 4 \\text{ minutes per question}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Joan has \\(\\boxed{4}\\) more minutes in answering each question on the Math exam than on the English exam.",

The Math exam has 15 questions and is to be completed in 1.5 hours. Since 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes, we divide 90 minutes by 15 questions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time per question in Math exam} = \\frac{90 \\text{ minutes}}{15 \\text{ questions}} = 6 \\text{ minutes per question}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in time spent per question between the Math exam and the English exam:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 6 \\text{ minutes per question} - 2 \\text{ minutes per question} = 4 \\text{ minutes per question}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Joan has \\(\\boxed{4}\\) more minutes to spend on each question on the Math exam than on the English exam.",

        "To determine how many more minutes Joan has to spend on each question in the Math exam compared to the English exam, we need to calculate the time spent on each question for both exams and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time spent on each question in the English exam. The English exam has 30 questions and is to be completed in 1 hour (which is 60 minutes). Therefore, the time spent on each question in the English exam is:\n\\[\n\\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{30 \\text{ questions}} = 2 \\text{ minutes per question}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the time spent on each question in the Math exam. The Math exam has 15 questions and is to be completed in 1.5 hours (which is 90 minutes). Therefore, the time spent on each question in the Math exam is:\n\\[\n\\frac{90 \\text{ minutes}}{15 \\text{ questions}} = 6 \\text{ minutes per question}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in time spent on each question between the Math exam and the English exam:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ minutes per question} - 2 \\text{ minutes per question} = 4 \\text{ minutes per question}\n\\]\n\nThus, Joan has \\(\\boxed{4}\\) more minutes to spend on each question in the Math exam than in the English exam.",
