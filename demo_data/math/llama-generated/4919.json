She knows that she'll be really busy at work the four weekdays starting on the 13th, so she won't have time to read. She can also read 100 pages on the 23rd, when she'll have a long boring flight. If she reads the same number of pages every other day, how many pages a day does she need to read?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many pages Jenna needs to read each day, we first need to account for the days she won't be reading and the day she will read a specific amount.

This totals 4 days.\n3. **Identify the day Jenna will read 100 pages**: She will read 100 pages on the 23rd. This is 1 day.\n4. **Calculate the number of days Jenna will read a consistent amount**: Subtract the days she won't read and the day she will read 100 pages from the total number of days in September. This is \\(30 - 4 - 1 = 25\\) days.\n5. **Determine the total number of pages Jenna needs to read on the days she reads a consistent amount**: Subtract the 100 pages she will read on the 23rd from her total goal of 600 pages. This is \\(600 - 100 = 500\\) pages.\n6. **Calculate the number of pages Jenna needs to read each day on the days she reads a consistent amount**: Divide the total number of pages she needs to read on the days she reads a consistent amount by the number of those days.
