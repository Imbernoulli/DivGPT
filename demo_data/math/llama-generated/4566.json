        "Let's denote the number of people at Taylor's birthday party as \\( T \\). According to the problem, Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's party, so the number of people at Ryan's party can be expressed as \\( 4T \\).\n\nThe total number of people at both parties combined is given as 240. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\\[ T + 4T = 240 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 5T = 240 \\]\n\nTo find \\( T \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\\[ T = \\frac{240}{5} = 48 \\]\n\nSo, the number of people at Taylor's party is 48. Since Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's party, the number of people at Ryan's party is:\n\\[ 4T = 4 \\times 48 = 192 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people at Ryan's party is \\(\\boxed{192}\\).",

        "Let's define the number of people at Taylor's birthday party as \\( T \\). According to the problem, Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's party, so the number of people at Ryan's party is \\( 4T \\).\n\nThe total number of people at both parties combined is given as 240. Therefore, we can write the following equation to represent the total number of people:\n\n\\[ T + 4T = 240 \\]\n\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 5T = 240 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( T \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{240}{5} = 48 \\]\n\nSo, there were 48 people at Taylor's party. Since Ryan's party had 4 times as many people as Taylor's party, we calculate the number of people at Ryan's party as follows:\n\n\\[ 4T = 4 \\times 48 = 192 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people at Ryan's party is \\(\\boxed{192}\\).",
        "To determine how many people were at Ryan's party, we start by defining variables for the number of people at each party. Let \\( T \\) represent the number of people at Taylor's birthday party. Since Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's party, we can express the number of people at Ryan's party as \\( 4T \\).\n\nNext, we know that the total number of people at both parties combined is 240. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent this relationship:\n\n\\[\nT + 4T = 240\n\\]\n\nCombining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n5T = 240\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( T \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{240}{5} = 48\n\\]\n\nNow that we know there are 48 people at Taylor's party, we can find the number of people at Ryan's party by multiplying \\( T \\) by 4:\n\n\\[\n4T = 4 \\times 48 = 192\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people at Ryan's party is \\(\\boxed{192}\\)."
