Identify the number of members in the first group.\n3. Identify the number of members in the second group.\n4. Subtract the number of members in the first group and the second group from the total number of members to find the number of members in the third group.\n\nLet's go through the calculations step by step:\n\n1. The total number of members in the choir is 70.\n2. The number of members in the first group is 25.\n3. The number of members in the second group is 30.\n\nNow, we subtract the number of members in the first group and the second group from the total number of members:\n\n\\[ 70 - 25 - 30 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of members in the third group is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
        "To determine the number of members in the third group, we start by calculating the total number of members in the first and second groups. The first group has 25 members and the second group has 30 members. Therefore, the combined number of members in the first and second groups is:\n\n\\[ 25 + 30 = 55 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of members in the first and second groups from the total number of members in the choir to find out how many members are in the third group. The total number of members in the choir is 70. So, we perform the following subtraction:\n\n\\[ 70 - 55 = 15 \\]\n\nThus, the number of members in the third group is \\(\\boxed{15}\\)."
