        "To determine how many ounces of artichoke dip Hakeem can make, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of artichokes Hakeem can buy:**\n   Hakeem has $15 to spend on artichokes, and each artichoke costs $1.25.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of artichokes} = \\frac{15}{1.25}\n   \\]\n   To simplify the division:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15}{1.25} = 15 \\times \\frac{1}{1.25} = 15 \\times 0.8 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, Hakeem can buy 12 artichokes.\n\n2. **Determine the amount of dip Hakeem can make with the artichokes:**\n   It takes 3 artichokes to make 5 ounces of dip.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ounces of dip per artichoke} = \\frac{5}{3}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, for 12 artichokes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ounces of dip} = 12 \\times \\frac{5}{3}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{12 \\times 5}{3} = \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\nThus, Hakeem can make \\(\\boxed{20}\\) ounces of artichoke dip.",

Determine how many ounces of dip he can make with the artichokes he buys.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate how many artichokes Hakeem can buy.**\n\nThe cost of each artichoke is $1.25. Hakeem has $15. Therefore, the number of artichokes he can buy is:\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{1.25} = 12\n\\]\nSo, Hakeem can buy 12 artichokes.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many ounces of dip he can make with the artichokes he buys.**\n\nIt takes 3 artichokes to make 5 ounces of dip.

Determine how many ounces of dip he can make with the artichokes he buys.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many artichokes Hakeem can buy. The cost of one artichoke is $1.25, so we divide $15 by $1.25:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{1.25} = 12\n\\]\n\nHakeem can buy 12 artichokes. Next, we need to find out how many ounces of dip he can make with 12 artichokes. It takes 3 artichokes to make 5 ounces of dip, so we can set up a proportion to find out how many ounces of dip 12 artichokes will make. The proportion is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\text{ artichokes}}{5 \\text{ ounces}} = \\frac{12 \\text{ artichokes}}{x \\text{ ounces}}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), we cross-multiply:\n\n\\[\n3x = 12 \\times 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3x = 60\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{60}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, Hakeem can make \\(\\boxed{20}\\) ounces of artichoke dip.",
