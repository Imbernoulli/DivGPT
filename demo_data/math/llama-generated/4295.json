She raises rabbits on her property by allowing the rabbits to graze on the grass that grows on her land.  If one rabbit can eat enough grass to clear ten square yards of lawn area per day, and Wendi owns 100 rabbits, how many days would it take for Wendi's rabbits to clear all the grass off of her grassland property?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
