        "To determine how many sweets are neither red nor green, we start by finding the total number of red and green sweets. The number of red sweets is 49, and the number of green sweets is 59. Adding these together, we get:\n\n\\[ 49 + 59 = 108 \\]\n\nThis means that there are 108 sweets that are either red or green. Since the total number of sweets in the bowl is 285, we can find the number of sweets that are neither red nor green by subtracting the number of red and green sweets from the total number of sweets:\n\n\\[ 285 - 108 = 177 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of sweets that are neither red nor green is \\(\\boxed{177}\\).",
