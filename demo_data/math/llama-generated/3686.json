Calculate the total amount of sleep Samantha's father gets in a week.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the average amount of sleep Samantha's baby sister gets each night.**\n\nSamantha sleeps an average of 8 hours a night. Her baby sister sleeps 2.5 times as much as Samantha does. Therefore, the amount of sleep the baby sister gets each night is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 2.5 = 20 \\text{ hours/night} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much sleep Samantha's father gets each night.**\n\nFor every hour the baby sleeps, Samantha's father sleeps 30 minutes. Since the baby sleeps 20 hours each night, the amount of sleep Samantha's father gets each night is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ hours/night} \\times \\frac{30 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes/hour}} = 20 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours/night} = 10 \\text{ hours/night} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of sleep Samantha's father gets in a week.**\n\nThere are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total amount of sleep Samantha's father gets in a week is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 7 \\text{ nights/week} = 70 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]",

Calculate the total amount of sleep Samantha's father gets in a week.\n\nFirst, we know that Samantha sleeps an average of 8 hours a night. Her baby sister sleeps 2.5 times as much as Samantha does. Therefore, we calculate the baby's sleep per night as follows:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 2.5 = 20 \\text{ hours/night}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that for every hour the baby sleeps, Samantha's father sleeps 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours. Therefore, we calculate the father's sleep per night as follows:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours/hour} = 10 \\text{ hours/night}\n\\]\n\nFinally, to find out how many hours Samantha's father sleeps in a week, we multiply his sleep per night by the number of days in a week:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 70 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of hours Samantha's father sleeps in a week is \\boxed{70}.",

Since the baby sleeps 20 hours per night, the amount of sleep Samantha's father gets per night is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours/hour} = 10 \\text{ hours/night}\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many hours Samantha's father sleeps in a week, we multiply the amount of sleep he gets per night by the number of days in a week:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 70 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of hours Samantha's father sleeps in a week is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{70}\n\\]",

Her baby sister sleeps 2.5 times as much as Samantha does.\n\\[\n8 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 2.5 = 20 \\text{ hours/night}\n\\]\nSo, Samantha's baby sister sleeps an average of 20 hours a night.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much sleep Samantha's father gets per night based on the baby's sleep.**\n\nFor every hour the baby sleeps, Samantha's father sleeps 30 minutes. Since the baby sleeps 20 hours a night, we calculate the father's sleep per night as follows:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ hours/night} \\times \\frac{30 \\text{ minutes}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = 20 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours/night} = 10 \\text{ hours/night}\n\\]\nSo, Samantha's father sleeps an average of 10 hours a night.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of sleep Samantha's father gets in a week.**\n\nThere are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total amount of sleep Samantha's father gets in a week is:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 7 \\text{ nights/week} = 70 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Samantha's father sleeps in a week is \\boxed{70}.",
        "To determine how many hours Samantha's father sleeps in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the baby sister's average sleep per night:**\n   Samantha sleeps an average of 8 hours a night. The baby sister sleeps 2.5 times as much as Samantha.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Baby sister's sleep per night} = 2.5 \\times 8 = 20 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the father's sleep per night:**\n   For every hour the baby sleeps, the father sleeps 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours).

Determine how much sleep Samantha's father gets in a day based on the baby sister's sleep.\n3. Calculate the total amount of sleep Samantha's father gets in a week.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much Samantha's baby sister sleeps in a day.

Calculate the total amount of sleep Samantha's father gets in a week.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the average amount of sleep Samantha's baby sister gets per night.**\n\nSamantha sleeps an average of 8 hours a night. Her baby sister sleeps 2.5 times as much as Samantha does. Therefore, the baby's sleep per night is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 2.5 = 20 \\text{ hours/night} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much sleep Samantha's father gets per night based on the baby's sleep.**\n\nFor every hour the baby sleeps, Samantha's father sleeps 30 minutes. Since the baby sleeps 20 hours per night, the father's sleep per night is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours/hour} = 10 \\text{ hours/night} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of sleep Samantha's father gets in a week.**\n\nThere are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of sleep Samantha's father gets in a week is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 70 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hours Samantha's father sleeps in a week is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",

Determine how many hours Samantha's father sleeps in a day.\n3. Calculate how many hours Samantha's father sleeps in a week.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many hours Samantha's baby sister sleeps in a day. Since Samantha sleeps an average of 8 hours a night and her baby sister sleeps 2.5 times as much as Samantha, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 8 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 2.5 = 20 \\text{ hours/night} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many hours Samantha's father sleeps in a day. Since he sleeps 30 minutes for every hour the baby sleeps, and the baby sleeps 20 hours a day, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 20 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours/hour} = 10 \\text{ hours/night} \\]\n\nFinally, to find out how many hours Samantha's father sleeps in a week, we multiply the number of hours he sleeps in a day by the number of days in a week:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 70 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, Samantha's father sleeps \\(\\boxed{70}\\) hours in a week.",

Since the baby sleeps 20 hours each night, we multiply 20 by 0.5 (since 30 minutes is half an hour):\n\\[ 20 \\times 0.5 = 10 \\]\nSo, Samantha's father sleeps 10 hours each night.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many hours Samantha's father sleeps in a week.**\n\nThere are 7 days in a week. To find out how many hours Samantha's father sleeps in a week, we multiply his daily sleep time by 7:\n\\[ 10 \\times 7 = 70 \\]\nSo, Samantha's father sleeps 70 hours in a week.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]",
