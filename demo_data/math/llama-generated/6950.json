        "To determine the total amount of money Tim raised, we need to calculate the amount of money from the two different types of donations and then use this information to find the total amount raised.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of money from the $1200 donations. Tim received $1200 from 500 people:\n\\[\n500 \\times 1200 = 600000\n\\]\nSo, the total amount of money from the $1200 donations is $600,000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of money from the $600 donations. Tim received $600 from three times as many people as he received $1200 donations. Since he received $1200 donations from 500 people, he received $600 donations from:\n\\[\n3 \\times 500 = 1500\n\\]\npeople. Therefore, the total amount of money from the $600 donations is:\n\\[\n1500 \\times 600 = 900000\n\\]\nSo, the total amount of money from the $600 donations is $900,000.\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of money from both types of donations:\n\\[\n600000 + 900000 = 1500000\n\\]\nSo, the total amount of money from both types of donations is $1,500,000. According to the problem, these donations account for 40% of the total money that Tim raised. Let \\( x \\) be the total amount of money that Tim raised. Then:\n\\[\n0.4x = 1500000\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1500000}{0.4} = 3750000\n\\]\nSo, the total amount of money that Tim raised is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3750000}\n\\]",

Since three times as many people donated half the sum of $1200, we have:\n\\[\n3 \\times 500 = 1500 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money from the $600 donations:\n\\[\n1500 \\text{ people} \\times \\$600/\\text{person} = \\$900,000\n\\]\n\nThe sum of the $1200 donations and the $600 donations is:\n\\[\n\\$600,000 + \\$900,000 = \\$1,500,000\n\\]\n\nThis sum represents 40% of the total money raised. Let \\( T \\) be the total amount of money raised. Then we have:\n\\[\n0.4T = \\$1,500,000\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( T \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:\n\\[\nT = \\frac{\\$1,500,000}{0.4} = \\$3,750,000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Tim raised is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3750000}\n\\]",
