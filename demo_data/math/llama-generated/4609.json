        "Let's denote the price of an orange by \\( O \\), the price of a pear by \\( P \\), and the price of a banana by \\( B \\). According to the problem, we have the following equations:\n\n1. The difference between the price of an orange and the price of a pear equals the price of a banana:\n\\[ O - P = B \\]\n\n2. The total cost of an orange and a pear is $120:\n\\[ O + P = 120 \\]\n\n3. The price of a pear is $90:\n\\[ P = 90 \\]\n\nFirst, we substitute the value of \\( P \\) into the second equation to find the price of an orange:\n\\[ O + 90 = 120 \\]\n\\[ O = 120 - 90 \\]\n\\[ O = 30 \\]\n\nNow that we know the price of an orange is $30 and the price of a pear is $90, we can substitute these values into the first equation to find the price of a banana:\n\\[ 30 - 90 = B \\]\n\\[ B = -60 \\]\n\\[ B = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total price of buying 200 bananas and twice as many oranges as bananas. Since we are buying 200 bananas, we will buy \\( 2 \\times 200 = 400 \\) oranges. The total cost of the bananas is:\n\\[ 200 \\times 60 = 12000 \\]\n\nThe total cost of the oranges is:\n\\[ 400 \\times 30 = 12000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total price of buying 200 bananas and twice as many oranges as bananas is:\n\\[ 12000 + 12000 = 24000 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{24000} \\]",
