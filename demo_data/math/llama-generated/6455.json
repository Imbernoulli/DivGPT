        "To determine the total number of squirrels counted by both students, we start by calculating the number of squirrels counted by the second student. The second student counted a third more squirrels than the first student. Since the first student counted 12 squirrels, we need to find out what a third more than 12 is.\n\nFirst, we calculate a third of 12:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4\n\\]\nNext, we add this value to the original count of 12 to find the total number of squirrels counted by the second student:\n\\[\n12 + 4 = 16\n\\]\nNow, we add the number of squirrels counted by the first student to the number of squirrels counted by the second student to find the total count for both students:\n\\[\n12 + 16 = 28\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of squirrels counted by both students combined is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{28}\n\\]",

Calculate the number of squirrels counted by the second student. The second student counted a third more squirrels than the first student. This means the second student counted the number of squirrels equal to the first student's count plus one third of the first student's count.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Squirrels counted by the second student} = 12 + \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12\n   \\]\n   First, find one third of 12:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4\n   \\]\n   Now, add this to the first student's count:\n   \\[\n   12 + 4 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, the second student counted 16 squirrels.\n\n3.
