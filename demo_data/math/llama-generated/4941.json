        "To determine how many baby plants Eddy's spider plant will have produced after 4 years, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. Identify the number of times the plant produces baby plants in one year. According to the problem, the plant produces baby plants 2 times a year.\n2. Identify the number of baby plants produced each time. The plant produces 2 baby plants each time.\n3. Calculate the total number of baby plants produced in one year. Since the plant produces baby plants 2 times a year and each time it produces 2 baby plants, the total number of baby plants produced in one year is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ times/year} \\times 2 \\text{ baby plants/time} = 4 \\text{ baby plants/year}\n   \\]\n4.
