        "To determine the full price of a single green tractor, we need to calculate Tobias's earnings from both red and green tractors and then solve for the price of a green tractor.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Tobias's earnings from the red tractors:\n- Tobias sold 2 red tractors.\n- The price of each red tractor is $20,000.\n- Tobias gets paid 10% of the sales price for each red tractor.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from red tractors} = 2 \\times 20,000 \\times 0.10\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from red tractors} = 2 \\times 2,000\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from red tractors} = 4,000\n\\]\n\nNext, let's denote the price of a single green tractor as \\( x \\) dollars.

Therefore, the sum of his earnings from red tractors and green tractors is:\n\n\\[\n4,000 + 0.60x = 7,000\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.60x = 7,000 - 4,000\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.60x = 3,000\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3,000}{0.60}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 5,000\n\\]\n\nThus, the full price of a single green tractor is \\(\\boxed{5000}\\) dollars.",
