We know the total number of children is 40, and there are five times as many teenagers as toddlers. We are also given that there are 6 toddlers.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of teenagers:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of teenagers} = 5 \\times \\text{Number of toddlers} = 5 \\times 6 = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we let the number of newborns be \\( x \\). The total number of children is the sum of the number of toddlers, teenagers, and newborns:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of children} = \\text{Number of toddlers} + \\text{Number of teenagers} + \\text{Number of newborns}\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n40 = 6 + 30 + x\n\\]\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we have:\n\\[\n40 = 36 + x\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nx = 40 - 36 = 4\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of newborns Diana will be shopping for is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
        "To determine how many newborns Diana will be shopping for, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the number of toddlers:**\n   The problem states there are 6 toddlers.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of teenagers:**\n   The home has five times as many teenagers as toddlers. Therefore, the number of teenagers is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 6 = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total number of children:**\n   The total number of children at the home is 40.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of newborns:**\n   The total number of children is the sum of the number of toddlers, teenagers, and newborns. Let \\( N \\) represent the number of newborns. We can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   6 + 30 + N = 40\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( N \\):**\n   Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   36 + N = 40\n   \\]\n   Subtract 36 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   N = 40 - 36\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   N = 4\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Diana will be shopping for \\(\\boxed{4}\\) newborns."
