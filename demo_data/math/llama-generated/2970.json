        "To determine how many frogs Bret caught, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine how many frogs Alster caught:**\n   Alster caught 2 frogs.\n\n2. **Calculate how many frogs Quinn caught:**\n   Quinn catches twice the amount of frogs as Alster. Since Alster caught 2 frogs, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 = 4\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Quinn caught 4 frogs.\n\n3. **Calculate how many frogs Bret caught:**\n   Bret catches three times the amount of frogs as Quinn. Since Quinn caught 4 frogs, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4 = 12\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Bret caught 12 frogs.\n\nThus, the number of frogs Bret caught is \\boxed{12}.",
