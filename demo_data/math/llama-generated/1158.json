        "First, we need to determine the total number of donuts Chris buys. Since a dozen equals 12 donuts, Chris buys \\(2.5 \\times 12 = 30\\) donuts.\n\nNext, we calculate how many donuts Chris eats while driving. He eats 10% of the donuts, so we compute \\(10\\% \\times 30 = 0.1 \\times 30 = 3\\) donuts.\n\nAfter eating 3 donuts, the number of donuts left is \\(30 - 3 = 27\\). Then, Chris grabs another 4 donuts for his afternoon snack, so we subtract 4 from the remaining donuts: \\(27 - 4 = 23\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of donuts left for his co-workers is \\(\\boxed{23}\\).",
