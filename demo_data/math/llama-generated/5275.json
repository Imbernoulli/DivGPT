Subtract the number of stamps used for the envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds from the total number of stamps bought to find out how many stamps were used for the envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds.\n3. Determine the number of envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds based on the number of stamps used for them.\n4. Add the number of envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds to the number of envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds to find the total number of envelopes bought.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Micah bought 6 envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds. Since each of these envelopes requires 2 stamps, the total number of stamps used for these envelopes is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 2 = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. Micah bought a total of 52 stamps. After using 12 stamps for the envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds, the number of stamps left for the envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds is:\n   \\[\n   52 - 12 = 40\n   \\]\n\n3. Each envelope that weighs more than 5 pounds requires 5 stamps. Therefore, the number of envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{5} = 8\n   \\]\n\n4. The total number of envelopes Micah bought is the sum of the envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds and the envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds:\n   \\[\n   6 + 8 = 14\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of envelopes Micah needed to buy is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of envelopes Micah bought, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Micah has 6 envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds. Since each of these envelopes requires 2 stamps, we can calculate the total number of stamps used for these envelopes:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ envelopes} \\times 2 \\text{ stamps per envelope} = 12 \\text{ stamps} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Micah bought a total of 52 stamps. To find out how many stamps are used for the envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds, we subtract the number of stamps used for the lighter envelopes from the total number of stamps:\n\\[ 52 \\text{ stamps} - 12 \\text{ stamps} = 40 \\text{ stamps} \\]\n\nSince each envelope that weighs more than 5 pounds requires 5 stamps, we can calculate the number of these envelopes by dividing the total number of stamps used for the heavier envelopes by 5:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ stamps} \\div 5 \\text{ stamps per envelope} = 8 \\text{ envelopes} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds to the number of envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds to find the total number of envelopes Micah bought:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ envelopes} + 8 \\text{ envelopes} = 14 \\text{ envelopes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of envelopes Micah needed to buy is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
