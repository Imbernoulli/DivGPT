        "To determine how many more minutes of video game time Diana will get as a result of the raise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the original amount of video game time Diana gets for reading 12 hours.\n2. Calculate the new amount of video game time Diana gets after the raise.\n3. Find the difference between the new amount and the original amount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the original amount of video game time Diana gets. She gets 30 minutes of video game time for every hour she reads. Since she read for 12 hours, we multiply 30 minutes by 12:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ minutes/hour} \\times 12 \\text{ hours} = 360 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the new amount of video game time Diana gets after the raise. The raise is 20%, so we need to find 20% of 360 minutes and add it to the original amount. First, we find 20% of 360 minutes:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 360 \\text{ minutes} = 72 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nNow, we add this 72 minutes to the original 360 minutes:\n\\[\n360 \\text{ minutes} + 72 \\text{ minutes} = 432 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the new amount and the original amount to determine how many more minutes of video game time Diana will get:\n\\[\n432 \\text{ minutes} - 360 \\text{ minutes} = 72 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Diana will get \\boxed{72} more minutes of video game time as a result of her raise.",
