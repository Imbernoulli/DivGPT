        "To determine how many soccer balls were inflated successfully and could be used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of soccer balls with holes.\n2. Subtract the number of soccer balls with holes from the total number of soccer balls to find the number of remaining soccer balls.\n3. Calculate the number of soccer balls that exploded due to overinflation.\n4. Subtract the number of soccer balls that exploded from the remaining soccer balls to find the number of soccer balls that were inflated successfully.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of soccer balls with holes:\n   \\[\n   40\\% \\text{ of } 100 = 0.40 \\times 100 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, 40 soccer balls had holes and could not inflate.\n\n2. Subtract the number of soccer balls with holes from the total number of soccer balls to find the number of remaining soccer balls:\n   \\[\n   100 - 40 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, there are 60 soccer balls remaining.\n\n3. Calculate the number of soccer balls that exploded due to overinflation:\n   \\[\n   20\\% \\text{ of } 60 = 0.20 \\times 60 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, 12 soccer balls exploded.\n\n4.
