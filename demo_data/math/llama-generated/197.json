        "To determine the number of slightly used crayons, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of new crayons.\n2. Calculate the number of broken crayons.\n3. Subtract the number of new and broken crayons from the total number of crayons to find the number of slightly used crayons.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of new crayons.**\n\nOne third of the crayons are new. Therefore, we need to find one third of 120.\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 120 = 40\n\\]\nSo, there are 40 new crayons.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of broken crayons.**\n\n20% of the crayons are broken. Therefore, we need to find 20% of 120.\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 120 = 24\n\\]\nSo, there are 24 broken crayons.\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of new and broken crayons from the total number of crayons to find the number of slightly used crayons.**\n\nThe total number of crayons is 120. We subtract the number of new crayons (40) and the number of broken crayons (24) from 120.\n\\[\n120 - 40 - 24 = 56\n\\]\nSo, there are 56 slightly used crayons.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{56}.",

Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of broken crayons} = 0.20 \\times 120 = 24\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of new crayons and broken crayons from the total number of crayons to find the number of slightly used crayons.**\n\nThe total number of crayons is 120. We subtract the number of new crayons and broken crayons:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of slightly used crayons} = 120 - 40 - 24 = 56\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of slightly used crayons is \\boxed{56}.",
        "To determine how many crayons are slightly used, we start by calculating the number of new crayons and the number of broken crayons.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of new crayons. Since one third of the crayons are new, we multiply the total number of crayons by one third:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 120 = 40\n\\]\nSo, there are 40 new crayons.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of broken crayons.

        "To determine how many crayons are slightly used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of new crayons.\n2. Calculate the number of broken crayons.\n3. Subtract the number of new and broken crayons from the total number of crayons to find the number of slightly used crayons.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of new crayons. Since one third of the crayons are new, we multiply the total number of crayons by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Number of new crayons} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 120 = 40\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of broken crayons. Since 20% of the crayons are broken, we multiply the total number of crayons by 0.20:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of broken crayons} = 0.20 \\times 120 = 24\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of new and broken crayons from the total number of crayons to find the number of slightly used crayons:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of slightly used crayons} = 120 - 40 - 24 = 56\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of slightly used crayons is \\(\\boxed{56}\\)."
