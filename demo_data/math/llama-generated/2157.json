        "To determine the number of children at the event, we start by identifying the number of men, women, and children based on the given information.\n\n1. **Number of Men:**\n   The problem states there are 40 men.\n\n2. **Number of Women:**\n   The number of women is half the number of men. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of women} = \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Number of Pieces (Men and Women):**\n   We add the number of men and women:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of men and women} = 40 + 20 = 60\n   \\]\n\n4. **Number of Children:**\n   The total number of guests is 80. To find the number of children, we subtract the total number of men and women from the total number of guests:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of children} = 80 - 60 = 20\n   \\]\n\n5. **Adding 10 more Children:**\n   Oleg adds 10 more children to the guest list. Therefore, we add 10 to the original number of children:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New number of children} = 20 + 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of children at the event will be \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
        "To determine the number of children at the event after adding 10 more, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of men and women.\n2.

According to the problem, the number of women is half the number of men. Therefore, the number of women is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of women} = \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, we know the total number of guests is 80. The rest of the guests are children. To find the number of children initially, we subtract the number of men and women from the total number of guests:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of children initially} = 80 - 40 - 20 = 20\n\\]\n\nIf Oleg adds 10 more children to the guest list, the new number of children will be:\n\\[\n\\text{New number of children} = 20 + 10 = 30\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of children at the event after adding 10 more is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{30}\n\\]",

Identify the number of men, women, and children initially on the guest list.\n2. Calculate the new number of children after adding 10 children.\n\nFirst, we know the total number of guests is 80. Out of these, 40 are men. According to the problem, the number of women is half the number of men. Therefore, the number of women is:\n\\[\n\\frac{40}{2} = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many children are initially on the guest list. The total number of guests is the sum of the number of men, women, and children. Let \\( C \\) be the number of children. Then we have:\n\\[\n40 + 20 + C = 80\n\\]\nSolving for \\( C \\), we get:\n\\[\nC = 80 - 40 - 20 = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, initially, there are 20 children on the guest list. If Oleg adds 10 children to the guest list, the new number of children will be:\n\\[\n20 + 10 = 30\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of children at the event will be \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
