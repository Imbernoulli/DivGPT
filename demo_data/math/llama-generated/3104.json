        "To determine how much money Steve will have in the bank after 2 years with an annual interest rate of 10%, we need to calculate the interest for each year and add it to the initial amount.\n\n1. **Initial Amount**: Steve starts with $100.\n2. **Interest for the First Year**: The interest for the first year is calculated as 10% of $100.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interest for the first year} = 100 \\times \\frac{10}{100} = 100 \\times 0.10 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, after the first year, the total amount in the bank is:\n   \\[\n   100 + 10 = 110\n   \\]\n\n3. **Interest for the Second Year**: The interest for the second year is calculated as 10% of the new amount, which is $110.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interest for the second year} = 110 \\times \\frac{10}{100} = 110 \\times 0.10 = 11\n   \\]\n   So, after the second year, the total amount in the bank is:\n   \\[\n   110 + 11 = 121\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money in the bank after 2 years is \\(\\boxed{121}\\).",

        "To determine how much money Steve will have in the bank after 2 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the initial amount. The interest is compounded annually, meaning that each year the interest is calculated on the new balance of the account, not just the original amount.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Amount**: Steve starts with $100.\n2. **Interest for the First Year**: The interest rate is 10%, so the interest earned in the first year is:\n   \\[\n   100 \\times 0.10 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Adding this interest to the initial amount, the balance after the first year is:\n   \\[\n   100 + 10 = 110 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n3. **Interest for the Second Year**: Now the interest is calculated on the new balance of $110. The interest earned in the second year is:\n   \\[\n   110 \\times 0.10 = 11 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Adding this interest to the balance after the first year, the balance after the second year is:\n   \\[\n   110 + 11 = 121 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money in the bank after 2 years is \\(\\boxed{121}\\).",
