Taylor uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water to make it weak and he doubles that amount to make it strong.  If he makes 12 cups of both weak and strong coffee, how many tablespoons of coffee will he need?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total number of tablespoons of coffee Taylor will need, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of coffee needed for the weak coffee.
