        "To determine how many slices of pizza were left over, we need to calculate the total amount of pizza consumed by Bob, Tom, Sally, and Jerry, and then subtract that from the total amount of pizza available.\n\nFirst, let's convert the fractions of pizza each person ate into slices. Since each pizza is cut into 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices each person ate as follows:\n- Bob ate half of a pizza: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6\\) slices.\n- Tom ate one-third of a pizza: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4\\) slices.\n- Sally ate one-sixth of a pizza: \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times 12 = 2\\) slices.\n- Jerry ate one-quarter of a pizza: \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3\\) slices.\n\nNext, we sum the slices eaten by all four individuals:\n\\[ 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 15 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nSince they started with 2 pizzas, the total number of slices available is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nTo find out how many slices were left over, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices available:\n\\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of slices left over is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
