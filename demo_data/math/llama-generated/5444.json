        "First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Hannah earned from selling cookies and cupcakes. She sold 40 pieces of cookies for $0.8 each, so the money earned from cookies is:\n\\[ 40 \\times 0.8 = 32 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, she sold 30 cupcakes for $2 each, so the money earned from cupcakes is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 2 = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding these amounts together gives the total money earned:\n\\[ 32 + 60 = 92 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nHannah used this money to buy 2 sets of measuring spoons for $6.5 each. The total cost of the measuring spoons is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 6.5 = 13 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTo find out how much money Hannah has left, we subtract the cost of the measuring spoons from the total money earned:\n\\[ 92 - 13 = 79 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Hannah has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{79} \\]"
