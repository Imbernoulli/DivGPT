        "To determine the combined experience of James, John, and Mike, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine John's current experience:**\n   - James currently has 20 years of experience.\n   - 8 years ago, James had \\( 20 - 8 = 12 \\) years of experience.\n   - 8 years ago, John had twice as much experience as James, so John had \\( 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\) years of experience.\n   - Therefore, John's current experience is \\( 24 + 8 = 32 \\) years.\n\n2. **Determine Mike's current experience:**\n   - Mike started when John had 16 years of experience.\n   - John currently has 32 years of experience, so Mike has been working for \\( 32 - 16 = 16 \\) years.\n   - Therefore, Mike's current experience is 16 years.\n\n3. **Calculate their combined experience:**\n   - James's experience: 20 years\n   - John's experience: 32 years\n   - Mike's experience: 16 years\n   - Combined experience: \\( 20 + 32 + 16 = 68 \\) years\n\nThus, their combined experience is \\(\\boxed{68}\\).",

        "Let's start by determining John's current experience. We know that 8 years ago John had twice as much experience as James. James currently has 20 years of experience, so 8 years ago James had:\n\n\\[ 20 - 8 = 12 \\text{ years of experience} \\]\n\nSince 8 years ago John had twice as much experience as James, John had:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ years of experience} \\]\n\nJohn's current experience is:\n\n\\[ 24 + 8 = 32 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine Mike's current experience.

Since John currently has 32 years of experience, the time that has passed since Mike started is:\n   \\[\n   32 - 16 = 16 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Mike's current experience is 16 years.\n\n4. **Calculate their combined experience:**\n   We add up the experience of James, John, and Mike:\n   \\[\n   20 + 32 + 16 = 68\n   \\]\n\nThe combined experience of James, John, and Mike is \\(\\boxed{68}\\).",
