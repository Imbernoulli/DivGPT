Find the difference in the number of correct answers between Sergio and Sylvia.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of incorrect answers Sylvia had. Since Sylvia had one-fifth of the answers incorrect and there were 50 questions, we can find the number of incorrect answers by multiplying 50 by \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Number of incorrect answers Sylvia had} = 50 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 10\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of correct answers Sylvia had by subtracting the number of incorrect answers from the total number of questions:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of correct answers Sylvia had} = 50 - 10 = 40\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that Sergio got 4 mistakes. Therefore, the number of correct answers Sergio had is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of correct answers Sergio had} = 50 - 4 = 46\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference in the number of correct answers between Sergio and Sylvia:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in correct answers} = 46 - 40 = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, Sergio has \\(\\boxed{6}\\) more correct answers than Sylvia.",

To find the number of correct answers Sergio received, we subtract the number of mistakes from the total number of questions:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of correct answers Sergio received} = 50 - 4 = 46\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of correct answers Sergio and Sylvia received:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 46 - 40 = 6\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Sergio has \\(\\boxed{6}\\) more correct answers than Sylvia.",

        "To determine how many more correct answers Sergio has than Sylvia, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of incorrect answers Sylvia had.\n2. Determine the number of correct answers Sylvia had.\n3. Determine the number of correct answers Sergio had.\n4. Find the difference between the number of correct answers Sergio and Sylvia had.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of incorrect answers Sylvia had. Since Sylvia had one-fifth of the answers incorrect and there were 50 questions in total, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of incorrect answers Sylvia had} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 50 = 10\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of correct answers Sylvia had by subtracting the number of incorrect answers from the total number of questions:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of correct answers Sylvia had} = 50 - 10 = 40\n\\]\n\nThen, we determine the number of correct answers Sergio had. Since Sergio got 4 mistakes, we subtract the number of mistakes from the total number of questions:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of correct answers Sergio had} = 50 - 4 = 46\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of correct answers Sergio and Sylvia had:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 46 - 40 = 6\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Sergio has \\(\\boxed{6}\\) more correct answers than Sylvia."
