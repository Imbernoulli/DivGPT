        "To determine how many businesses Brandon can still apply to, we need to calculate the number of businesses from which he has been fired and the number of businesses from which he has quit, and then subtract these from the total number of businesses in town.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of businesses from which Brandon has been fired. Since he has been fired from half the businesses in town:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of businesses fired from} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of businesses from which Brandon has quit. Since he has quit from a third of the businesses in town:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of businesses quit from} = \\frac{72}{3} = 24\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of businesses from which he has been fired and the number of businesses from which he has quit to find the total number of businesses he has left:\n\\[\n\\text{Total businesses left} = 36 + 24 = 60\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of businesses he has left from the total number of businesses in town to find the number of businesses he can still apply to:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of businesses he can still apply to} = 72 - 60 = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of businesses Brandon can still apply to is \\boxed{12}.",

        "To determine how many businesses Brandon can still apply to, we need to calculate the number of businesses he has been fired from and the number of businesses he has quit from, and then subtract these from the total number of businesses in town.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of businesses Brandon has been fired from. Since he has been fired from half the businesses in town, we can find this number by multiplying 72 by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\\[\n72 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 36\n\\]\nSo, Brandon has been fired from 36 businesses.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of businesses Brandon has quit from. Since he has quit from a third of the businesses in town, we can find this number by multiplying 72 by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\):\n\\[\n72 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 24\n\\]\nSo, Brandon has quit from 24 businesses.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many businesses Brandon has either been fired from or quit from. We do this by adding the number of businesses he has been fired from and the number of businesses he has quit from:\n\\[\n36 + 24 = 60\n\\]\nSo, Brandon has been fired from or quit from 60 businesses.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of businesses he has either been fired from or quit from from the total number of businesses in town to find out how many businesses he can still apply to:\n\\[\n72 - 60 = 12\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of businesses Brandon can still apply to is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
