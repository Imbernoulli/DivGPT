        "To determine the total number of animals on the farm after the farmer adds more animals, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial number of each type of animal on the farm.\n2. Add the number of each type of animal the farmer plans to add.\n3. Sum the total number of animals after the addition.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial number of each type of animal:\n- There are 2 cows.\n- There are 3 pigs.\n- There are 6 goats.\n\nNext, let's add the number of each type of animal the farmer plans to add:\n- The farmer plans to add 3 cows, so the total number of cows will be \\(2 + 3 = 5\\).\n- The farmer plans to add 5 pigs, so the total number of pigs will be \\(3 + 5 = 8\\).\n- The farmer plans to add 2 goats, so the total number of goats will be \\(6 + 2 = 8\\).\n\nNow, let's sum the total number of animals:\n- The total number of cows is 5.\n- The total number of pigs is 8.\n- The total number of goats is 8.\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[5 + 8 + 8 = 21\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals on the farm will be \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
