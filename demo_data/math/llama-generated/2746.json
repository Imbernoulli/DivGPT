Subtract the total amount spent from the amount Jane paid to find the change.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of one skirt is $13, and Jane bought 2 skirts. So, the total cost of the skirts is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 13 = 26\n   \\]\n\n2. The cost of one blouse is $6, and Jane bought 3 blouses. So, the total cost of the blouses is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 6 = 18\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we add the total cost of the skirts and the total cost of the blouses to find the total amount spent:\n   \\[\n   26 + 18 = 44\n   \\]\n\n4. Jane paid the cashier $100. To find the change she received, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount she paid:\n   \\[\n   100 - 44 = 56\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the change Jane received is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",

Now, we add the total cost of the skirts and the total cost of the blouses to find the total amount spent.\n   \\[\n   26 + 18 = 44\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount spent is $44.\n\n4. Jane paid the cashier $100. To find the change, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount Jane paid.\n   \\[\n   100 - 44 = 56\n   \\]\n   So, the change Jane received is $56.\n\nTherefore, the change Jane received is \\boxed{56}.",
