        "To determine the number of egg-laying hens on Mr. Curtis's farm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hens on the farm.\n2. Determine how many of those hens lay eggs.\n\nFirst, we find the total number of hens. Since Mr. Curtis has 325 chickens in total and 28 of them are roosters, the number of hens is:\n\\[ 325 - 28 = 297 \\]\n\nNext, we know that 20 hens do not lay eggs. Therefore, the number of egg-laying hens is the total number of hens minus the number of hens that do not lay eggs:\n\\[ 297 - 20 = 277 \\]\n\nSo, the number of egg-laying hens on Mr. Curtis's farm is:\n\\[ \\boxed{277} \\]",
