        "To determine the number of people in the conference center, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total capacity of the conference center.\n2. Determine what 2/3 of the total capacity is.\n\nFirst, let's find the total capacity of the conference center. Since there are six rooms and each room can hold up to 80 people, we multiply the number of rooms by the capacity of each room:\n\\[\n6 \\times 80 = 480\n\\]\nSo, the total capacity of the conference center is 480 people.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many people are in the conference center if it is 2/3 full. We do this by multiplying the total capacity by 2/3:\n\\[\n480 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 480 \\times 0.6667 = 320\n\\]\nSo, the number of people in the conference center is \\boxed{320}.",
