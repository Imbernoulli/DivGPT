        "Let's denote the initial number of marbles Zack had as \\( x \\). According to the problem, when Zack divides his marbles among three people, he leaves himself with 5 marbles. This means that if we subtract 5 from the initial number of marbles, the result is divisible by 3. Mathematically, we can express this as:\n\\[ x - 5 = 3k \\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\). Rearranging this equation, we get:\n\\[ x = 3k + 5 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that Zack gives each of his three friends 20 marbles and keeps 5 for himself. Therefore, the total number of marbles he gives away is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\]\nAdding the 5 marbles he keeps, the total number of marbles Zack had initially is:\n\\[ 60 + 5 = 65 \\]\n\nWe can verify that 65 satisfies the first condition. If we subtract 5 from 65, we get:\n\\[ 65 - 5 = 60 \\]\nSince 60 is divisible by 3, the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the initial number of marbles Zack had is:\n\\[ \\boxed{65} \\]",
