        "To determine how many complete laps Lexi must run, we need to convert the total distance she wants to run into the number of laps. We know that each lap is a quarter of a mile, so we can set up the following division:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of laps} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Distance per lap}} = \\frac{3 \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ miles}}{\\frac{1}{4} \\text{ miles per lap}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we convert the mixed number \\(3 \\frac{1}{4}\\) into an improper fraction. The number \\(3 \\frac{1}{4}\\) means \\(3 + \\frac{1}{4}\\). To convert this to an improper fraction, we multiply the whole number 3 by the denominator 4 and then add the numerator 1:\n\n\\[\n3 \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3 \\times 4 + 1}{4} = \\frac{12 + 1}{4} = \\frac{13}{4}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can rewrite the division of the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13}{4} \\div \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{13}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{1} = \\frac{13 \\times 4}{4 \\times 1} = \\frac{52}{4} = 13\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Lexi must run \\(\\boxed{13}\\) complete laps.",
