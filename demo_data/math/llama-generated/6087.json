        "To determine how many more pounds of groceries Mary can fit in the plastic grocery bag, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the weight of the carrots.\n2. Add the weights of the green beans, milk, and carrots to find the total weight of the groceries.\n3. Subtract the total weight of the groceries from the maximum capacity of the bag to find out how many more pounds can be added.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the weight of the carrots. Mary buys twice the amount of carrots as green beans. Since she buys 4 pounds of green beans, the weight of the carrots is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we add the weights of the green beans, milk, and carrots to find the total weight of the groceries:\n\\[ 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThe maximum capacity of the bag is 20 pounds. To find out how many more pounds of groceries Mary can fit in the bag, we subtract the total weight of the groceries from the maximum capacity:\n\\[ 20 - 18 = 2 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of more pounds of groceries Mary can fit in the bag is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
