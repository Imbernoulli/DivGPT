        "To determine how many minutes Mia spent studying each day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the time Mia spent watching TV.\n2. Determine the time left after watching TV.\n3. Calculate the time Mia spent studying.\n\nFirst, we know that Mia spends \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of her day watching TV. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the time spent watching TV as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times 24 = \\frac{24}{5} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nTo convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{5} \\times 60 = \\frac{24 \\times 60}{5} = \\frac{1440}{5} = 288 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nSo, Mia spent 288 minutes watching TV.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much time is left after watching TV. Since there are 1440 minutes in a day (24 hours \\(\\times\\) 60 minutes), the time left after watching TV is:\n\\[\n1440 - 288 = 1152 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nMia spends \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the remaining time on studying. Therefore, the time spent studying is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 1152 = \\frac{1152}{4} = 288 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, Mia spent \\(\\boxed{288}\\) minutes studying each day.",

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we subtract the time spent watching TV from 24:\n\\[\n\\text{Time left after watching TV} = 24 - 4.8 = 19.2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nMia spent \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the remaining time on studying. Therefore, we calculate the time spent studying as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent studying} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 19.2 = \\frac{19.2}{4} = 4.8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSince we need the answer in minutes, we convert the hours spent studying into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent studying in minutes} = 4.8 \\times 60 = 288 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of minutes Mia spent studying each day is \\(\\boxed{288}\\).",

Since there are 1440 minutes in a day (24 hours \\(\\times\\) 60 minutes), we subtract the time spent watching TV from 1440:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining time} = 1440 - 288 = 1152 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nMia spent \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the remaining time on studying. Therefore, we calculate the time spent studying as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent studying} = 1152 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1152}{4} = 288 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of minutes Mia spent studying each day is \\(\\boxed{288}\\).",

        "To determine how many minutes Mia spent studying each day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the time Mia spent watching TV.\n2. Determine the time left after watching TV.\n3. Calculate the time Mia spent studying.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the time Mia spent watching TV.**\n\nMia spends \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of her day watching TV. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can find the time spent watching TV in hours by multiplying 24 by \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times 24 = \\frac{24}{5} = 4.8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the time left after watching TV.**\n\nAfter watching TV, the time left in the day is:\n\n\\[\n24 - 4.8 = 19.2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the time Mia spent studying.**\n\nMia spends \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the time left on studying. So, we find the time spent studying in hours by multiplying 19.2 by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 19.2 = \\frac{19.2}{4} = 4.8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSince we need the time spent studying in minutes, we convert 4.8 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:\n\n\\[\n4.8 \\times 60 = 288 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of minutes Mia spent studying each day is \\(\\boxed{288}\\).",
        "To determine how many minutes Mia spent studying each day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the time Mia spent watching TV.\n2. Determine the remaining time after watching TV.\n3. Calculate the time Mia spent studying, which is 1/4 of the remaining time.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many minutes Mia spent watching TV. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we convert the fraction of the day to minutes:\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent watching TV} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 24 \\text{ hours} = \\frac{24}{5} \\text{ hours} = 4.8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nNext, we convert 4.8 hours to minutes:\n\\[\n4.8 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 288 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nSo, Mia spent 288 minutes watching TV. Now, we need to find out how many minutes are left after watching TV:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining time} = 24 \\times 60 - 288 = 1440 - 288 = 1152 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nMia spent 1/4 of the remaining time studying:\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent studying} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 1152 = 288 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of minutes Mia spent studying each day is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{288}\n\\]",
