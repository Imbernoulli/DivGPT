        "To determine how many quarters Phil has left after his purchases, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he spent. Phil bought a slice of pizza for $2.75, a soda for $1.50, and a pair of jeans for $11.50. Adding these amounts together, we get:\n\n\\[2.75 + 1.50 + 11.50 = 15.75\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount spent from Phil's original amount of $40 to find out how much money he has left:\n\n\\[40.00 - 15.75 = 24.25\\]\n\nSince Phil has nothing but quarters left, we need to convert $24.25 into quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so we divide $24.25 by $0.25 to find the number of quarters:\n\n\\[24.25 \\div 0.25 = 97\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of quarters Phil now has is \\(\\boxed{97}\\).",
