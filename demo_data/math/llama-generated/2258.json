        "To determine how much Luca paid for his drink, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discounted price of the sandwich.\n2. Add the cost of the sliced avocado.\n3. Add the cost of the salad.\n4. Subtract the total cost of the sandwich, avocado, and salad from the total lunch bill to find the cost of the drink.\n\nLet's start with the sandwich. The original price of the sandwich is $8, and Luca has a coupon for a quarter of the price off. So, we calculate the discount:\n\\[\n\\text{Discount} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 8 = 2 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nSubtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of the sandwich:\n\\[\n\\text{Discounted sandwich price} = 8 - 2 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nNext, Luca upgraded the sandwich with sliced avocado, which costs an extra dollar. So, we add the cost of the avocado to the discounted price of the sandwich:\n\\[\n\\text{Total sandwich cost} = 6 + 1 = 7 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nLuca also added a $3 salad. So, we add the cost of the salad to the total sandwich cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of sandwich and avocado} = 7 + 3 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nFinally, we subtract the total cost of the sandwich and avocado from the total lunch bill to find the cost of the drink:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of the drink} = 12 - 10 = 2 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nTherefore, Luca paid \\(\\boxed{2}\\) dollars for his drink.",
