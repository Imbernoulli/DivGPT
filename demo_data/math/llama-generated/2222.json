        "To determine the total cost Samantha spends at the laundromat, we need to calculate the cost of using the washers and the dryers separately and then sum these costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of using the washers:\n- Samantha does 2 loads of laundry.\n- Each load costs $4.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the washers is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of using the dryers:\n- Samantha divides all the washed clothes equally into 3 separate dryers.\n- Each dryer runs for 40 minutes.\n- The cost per dryer is $0.25 for every 10 minutes.\n\nFirst, we find the cost for one dryer:\n- Each dryer runs for 40 minutes.\n- There are 40 minutes divided by 10 minutes per unit:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{40}{10} = 4 \\text{ units}\n  \\]\n- The cost per unit is $0.25.\n- Therefore, the total cost for one dryer is:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 0.25 = 1 \\text{ dollar}\n  \\]\n\nSince Samantha uses 3 dryers, the total cost for all the dryers is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 1 = 3 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the total cost of the washers and the total cost of the dryers to find the overall total cost:\n\\[\n8 + 3 = 11 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount Samantha spends altogether is \\boxed{11}.",
