        "To determine how many milliliters of water are left in the bathtub, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of water added to the bathtub by the faucet:**\n\n   The faucet drips at a rate of 40 ml/minute. Jack leaves the water running for 9 hours.\n\n   First, convert hours to minutes:\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 540 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, calculate the total amount of water added:\n   \\[\n   540 \\text{ minutes} \\times 40 \\text{ ml/minute} = 21600 \\text{ ml}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of water evaporated from the bathtub:**\n\n   Water evaporates at a rate of 200 ml/hour. Jack leaves the water running for 9 hours.\n\n   Calculate the total amount of water evaporated:\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ hours} \\times 200 \\text{ ml/hour} = 1800 \\text{ ml}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the net amount of water added to the bathtub:**\n\n   Subtract the amount of water evaporated from the total amount of water added:\n   \\[\n   21600 \\text{ ml} - 1800 \\text{ ml} = 19800 \\text{ ml}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the amount of water left after dumping it out:**\n\n   Jack dumps out 12 liters of water. First, convert liters to milliliters:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ liters} \\times 1000 \\text{ ml/liter} = 12000 \\text{ ml}\n   \\]\n\n   Subtract the amount of water asked out from the net amount of water added:\n   \\[\n   19800 \\text{ ml} - 12000 \\text{ ml} = 7800 \\text{ ml}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of milliliters of water left in the bathtub is \\(\\boxed{7800}\\).",
        "To determine how many milliliters of water are left in the bathtub after Jack leaves the water running for 9 hours and then dumps out 12 liters, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of water added by the faucet over 9 hours.\n2. Calculate the total amount of water evaporated over 9 hours.\n3. Determine the net amount of water added to the bathtub over 9 hours.\n4. Convert the amount of water dumped out from liters to milliliters.\n5. Subtract the amount of water dumped out from the net amount of water added to find the final amount of water left in the bathtub.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The faucet drips at a rate of 40 ml/minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the rate in ml/hour is:\n   \\[\n   40 \\, \\text{ml/minute} \\times 60 \\, \\text{minutes/hour} = 2400 \\, \\text{ml/hour}\n   \\]\n   Over 9 hours, the total amount of water added by the faucet is:\n   \\[\n   2400 \\, \\text{ml/hour} \\times 9 \\, \\text{hours} = 21600 \\, \\text{ml}\n   \\]\n\n2. The water evaporates at a rate of 200 ml/hour. Over 9 hours, the total amount of water evaporated is:\n   \\[\n   200 \\, \\text{ml/hour} \\times 9 \\, \\text{hours} = 1800 \\, \\text{ml}\n   \\]\n\n3. The net amount of water added to the bathtub over 9 hours is the total amount of water added by the faucet minus the total amount of water evaporated:\n   \\[\n   21600 \\, \\text{ml} - 1800 \\, \\text{ml} = 19800 \\, \\text{ml}\n   \\]\n\n4. Jack dumps out 12 liters of water. Since 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, 12 liters is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\, \\text{liters} \\times 1000 \\, \\text{ml/liter} = 12000 \\, \\text{ml}\n   \\]\n\n5. The final amount of water left in the bathtub is the net amount of water added minus the amount of water dumped out:\n   \\[\n   19800 \\, \\text{ml} - 12000 \\, \\text{ml} = 7800 \\, \\text{ml}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of milliliters of water left in the bathtub is \\(\\boxed{7800}\\).",

Determine the net amount of water added to the bathtub by subtracting the evaporated water from the added water.\n4. Subtract the amount of water dumped out from the net amount of water added.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of water added to the bathtub by the dripping faucet over 9 hours:**\n\n   The dripping rate is 40 ml/minute. First, we need to convert this rate to ml/hour:\n   \\[\n   40 \\text{ ml/minute} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 2400 \\text{ ml/hour}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, we calculate the total amount of water added over 9 hours:\n   \\[\n   2400 \\text{ ml/hour} \\times 9 \\text{ hours} = 21600 \\text{ ml}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of water evaporated from the bathtub over 9 hours:**\n\n   The evaporation rate is 200 ml/hour. So, we calculate the total amount of water evaporated over 9 hours:\n   \\[\n   200 \\text{ ml/hour} \\times 9 \\text{ hours} = 1800 \\text{ ml}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the net amount of water added to the bathtub by subtracting the evaporated water from the added water:**\n\n   \\[\n   21600 \\text{ ml} - 1800 \\text{ ml} = 19800 \\text{ ml}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the amount of water dumped out from the net amount of water added:**\n\n   Jack dumps out 12 liters of water. First, we need to convert this amount to milliliters:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ liters} \\times 1000 \\text{ ml/liter} = 12000 \\text{ ml}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, we subtract the amount of water dumped out from the net amount of water added:\n   \\[\n   19800 \\text{ ml} - 12000 \\text{ ml} = 7800 \\text{ ml}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of water left in the bathtub is \\(\\boxed{7800}\\) milliliters.",
        "First, we need to calculate the total amount of water added to the bathtub by the dripping faucet over 9 hours. The faucet drips at a rate of 40 ml/minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the rate of stretching in ml/hour is:\n\n\\[ 40 \\text{ ml/minute} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 2400 \\text{ ml/hour} \\]\n\nOver 9 hours, the total amount of water added is:\n\n\\[ 2400 \\text{ ml/hour} \\times 9 \\text{ hours} = 21600 \\text{ ml} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of water evaporated from the bathtub over 9 hours.

        "To determine how many milliliters of water are left in the bathtub, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of water added by the faucet:**\n   Jack leaves the faucet dripping at a rate of 40 ml/minute. Since he leaves the water running for 9 hours, we first convert hours to minutes:\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 540 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n   Next, we calculate the total amount of water added:\n   \\[\n   40 \\text{ ml/minute} \\times 540 \\text{ minutes} = 21600 \\text{ ml}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of water evaporated:**\n   Water evaporates from the bathtub at a rate of 200 ml/hour.

        "To determine how much water is left in the bathtub after Jack leaves the faucet dripping for 9 hours and then dumps out 12 liters, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of water added by the faucet:**\n   - The faucet drips at a rate of 40 ml/minute.\n   - Jack leaves the faucet running for 9 hours.\n   - Convert hours to minutes: \\( 9 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 540 \\text{ minutes} \\).\n   - Total water added: \\( 40 \\text{ ml/minute} \\times 540 \\text{ minutes} = 21600 \\text{ ml} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of water evaporated:**\n   - Water evaporates at a rate of 200 ml/hour.\n   - Jack leaves the water running for 9 hours.\n   - Total water evaporated: \\( 200 \\text{ ml/hour} \\times 9 \\text{ hours} = 1800 \\text{ ml} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the net amount of water added to the bathtub:**\n   - Net water added: Total water added - Total water evaporated.\n   - Net water added: \\( 21600 \\text{ ml} - 1800 \\text{ ml} = 19800 \\text{ ml} \\).\n\n4. **Convert the amount of water dumped out from liters to milliliters:**\n   - Jack dumps out 12 liters.\n   - Convert liters to milliliters: \\( 12 \\text{ liters} \\times 1000 \\text{ ml/liter} = 12000 \\text{ ml} \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the amount of water left in the bathtub:**\n   - Water left: Net water added - Water dumped out.\n   - Water left: \\( 19800 \\text{ ml} - 12000 \\text{ ml} = 7800 \\text{ ml} \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of milliliters of water left in the bathtub is \\(\\boxed{7800}\\)."
