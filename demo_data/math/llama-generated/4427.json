        "To determine how many containers of paint Mikaela will have left over, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of containers of paint required to paint one wall.\n2. Determine the total number of containers of paint used after the changes.\n3. Subtract the total number of containers of paint used from the initial number of containers.\n\nFirst, we find out how many containers of paint are needed for one wall. Since Mikaela bought 16 containers of paint to cover four equally-sized walls, we divide the total number of containers by the number of walls:\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{4} = 4\n\\]\nSo, each wall requires 4 containers of paint.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of containers of paint used after Mikaela decided to put tile on one wall and paint flowers on the ceiling with one container of paint. Since she put tile on one wall, she does not use any paint for that wall. She also uses 1 container of paint for the ceiling. Therefore, the total number of containers of paint used is:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ (for the first wall)} + 4 \\text{ (for the second wall)} + 4 \\text{ (for the third wall)} + 1 \\text{ (for the ceiling)} = 12 + 1 = 13\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of containers of paint used from the initial number of containers:\n\\[\n16 - 13 = 3\n\\]\nSo, Mikaela will have \\boxed{3} containers of paint left over.",

        "To determine how many containers of paint Mikaela will have left over, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial amount of paint per wall:**\n   Mikaela bought 16 containers of paint to cover four equally-sized walls. Therefore, the amount of paint per wall is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{16 \\text{ containers}}{4 \\text{ walls}} = 4 \\text{ containers per wall}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total amount of paint initially needed for four walls:**\n   Since each wall requires 4 containers of paint and there are four walls:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ containers per wall} \\times 4 \\text{ walls} = 16 \\text{ containers}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Adjust for the wall with tile:**\n   Mikaela decided to put tile on one wall, so she does not need paint for that wall. Therefore, the total amount of paint needed for the remaining three walls is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ containers per wall} \\times 3 \\text{ walls} = 12 \\text{ containers}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Add the paint for the ceiling:**\n   Mikaela also painted flowers on the ceiling with one container of paint. Therefore, the total amount of paint needed for the three walls and the ceiling is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ containers} + 1 \\text{ container} = 13 \\text{ containers}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the leftover paint:**\n   Mikaela initially bought 16 containers of paint. After using 13 containers, the number of containers left over is:\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ containers} - 13 \\text{ containers} = 3 \\text{ containers}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of containers of paint Mikaela will have left over is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
