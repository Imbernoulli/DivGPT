        "To determine the total number of matches played by both teams, we start by identifying the number of matches each team has won, drawn, and lost.\n\nFirst, we know that the home team has won 3 matches. Since the rival team has won twice as many matches as the home team, we calculate the number of matches the rival team has won as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\]\n\nNext, we know that both teams have drawn 4 matches and lost 0 matches. Therefore, the total number of matches played by the home team is the sum of its wins, draws, and losses:\n\\[ 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 \\]\n\nSimilarly, the total number of matches played by the rival team is the sum of its wins, draws, and losses:\n\\[ 6 + 4 + 0 = 10 \\]\n\nTo find the total number of matches played by both teams, we add the total number of matches played by the home team and the total number of matches played by the rival team:\n\\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of matches played by both teams is:\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]",
