Determine the total number of skips in 5 minutes using her new speed.\n\nStep 1: Jan's original skipping speed is 70 skips per minute.\n\nStep 2: After doubling her speed, her new skipping speed is:\n\\[ 70 \\text{ skips per minute} \\times 2 = 140 \\text{ skips per minute} \\]\n\nStep 3: To find out how many skips she does in 5 minutes, we multiply her new skipping speed by 5:\n\\[ 140 \\text{ skips per minute} \\times 5 \\text{ minutes} = 700 \\text{ skips} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of skips Jan does in 5 minutes is \\(\\boxed{700}\\).",
