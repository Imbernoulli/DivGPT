To encourage him, Paul's dad promised him $5 for every B+ he gets in his next scorecard and twice that amount for every A. If Paul obtains at least two A+ he'll double the previous rewards and would receive a flat $15 for every A+ obtained (with no extra bonus). If there are 10 courses with grades in Paul's scorecard, what's the maximum amount he could receive from his dad?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the maximum amount Paul could receive from his dad, we need to consider the best possible scenario for his grades.

To maximize the reward, we should assume he gets A grades for all the remaining grades because A grades give more reward than B+ grades.\n   - The reward for an A grade is $10, but since he gets at least two A+ grades, the reward for the A grades and B+ grades is doubled.\n   - Therefore, the reward for an A grade is \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) dollars, and the reward for a B+ grade is \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) dollars.\n   - If he gets 8 A grades, the reward is \\(8 \\times 20 = 160\\) dollars.\n\n4. **Calculate the total reward:**\n   - The total reward is the sum of the reward for the A+ grades and the reward for the remaining grades.\n   - Therefore, the total reward is \\(30 + 160 = 190\\) dollars.\n\nThe maximum amount Paul could receive from his dad is \\(\\boxed{190}\\).",

If Paul gets at least two A+ grades, he will get $15 for each A+, and the rewards for A's and B+ grades will be doubled. Therefore, let's set \\(a+ = 2\\) and see if we can maximize the reward under these conditions.\n\nIf \\(a+ = 2\\), then we have:\n\n\\[a + b + 2 = 10 \\implies a + b = 8\\]\n\nThe reward for A's and B+ grades will be doubled, so the reward for each A is $20 and the reward for each B+ is $10.

The maximum value for \\(a\\) is 8 (since \\(a + b = 8\\)). If \\(a = 8\\), then \\(b = 0\\), and the total reward is:\n\n\\[110 + 10 \\times 8 = 110 + 80 = 190\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum amount Paul could receive from his dad is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{190}\\]",

The highest possible grades are A+s, A-s, and B+s. Since the problem specifies that there are 10 courses, the maximum discount scenario is that Paul gets at least two A+s. In this scenario, the reward for each A+ is $15, and the rewards for A-s and B+s are doubled from the original rewards.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Rewards for A+s:**\n   - With at least two A+s, the reward for each A+ is $15. If Paul gets \\(a\\) A+s, the total reward for A+s is \\(15a\\).\n\n2. **Rewards for A-s:**\n   - The original reward for an A is twice the reward for a B+, which is \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) dollars.
