        "To determine how high Barry and Larry can reach when Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Larry's shoulder height:**\n   Larry is 5 feet tall, and his shoulder height is 20% less than his full height. First, we find 20% of Larry's height:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 5 = 1 \\text{ foot}\n   \\]\n   Then, we subtract this value from Larry's height to find his shoulder height:\n   \\[\n   5 - 1 = 4 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total height when Barry stands on Larry's shoulders:**\n   Barry can reach 5 feet high when standing on the ground.
