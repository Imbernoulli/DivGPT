Let \\( Q \\) be the amount Quinn spends. We can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   R = 2Q\n   \\]\n   Substituting the value for \\( R \\):\n   \\[\n   60 = 2Q\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( Q \\):\n   \\[\n   Q = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n   So, Quinn spends $30 every year.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount spent by each person in 4 years:**\n   - Trevor spends $80 per year. Over 4 years:\n     \\[\n     T_{\\text{total}} = 80 \\times 4 = 320\n     \\]\n   - Reed spends $60 per year.
