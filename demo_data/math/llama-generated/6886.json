        "To determine the number of classical CDs in Henry's collection, we start by defining variables for the number of each type of CD.

We are also given that he has 23 country CDs. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ r + 3 = 23 \\]\n\nTo find the number of rock CDs, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ r = 23 - 3 \\]\n\\[ r = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Henry has twice as many rock CDs as classical CDs.

        "To determine the number of classical CDs in Henry's collection, we start by defining variables for the number of each type of CD. Let \\( r \\) represent the number of rock CDs, and \\( c \\) represent the number of classical CDs. According to the problem, Henry has 3 more country CDs than rock CDs and twice as many rock CDs as classical CDs. We are also given that he has 23 country CDs.\n\nFirst, we can express the number of country CDs in terms of the number of rock CDs:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of country CDs} = r + 3\n\\]\nWe know from the problem statement that the number of country CDs is 23, so we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\nr + 3 = 23\n\\]\nTo find the value of \\( r \\), we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nr = 23 - 3\n\\]\n\\[\nr = 20\n\\]\nSo, Henry has 20 rock CDs.\n\nNext, we use the information that Henry has twice as many rock CDs as classical CDs.

        "To determine the number of classical CDs in Henry's collection, we start by defining variables for the number of each type of CD. Let's denote the number of rock CDs by \\( r \\) and the number of classical CDs by \\( c \\).\n\n According to the problem, Henry has 3 more country CDs than rock CDs. Since he has 23 country CDs, we can write the following equation:\n\\[ 23 = r + 3 \\]\n\n To find the number of rock CDs, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ r = 23 - 3 \\]\n\\[ r = 20 \\]\n\n The problem also states that Henry has twice as many rock CDs as classical CDs. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\\[ r = 2c \\]\n\n Since we already know that \\( r = 20 \\), we substitute 20 for \\( r \\) in the equation:\n\\[ 20 = 2c \\]\n\n To find the number of classical CDs, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ c = \\frac{20}{2} \\]\n\\[ c = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the number of classical CDs in Henry's collection is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
