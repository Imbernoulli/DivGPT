        "To determine the total number of students in the class, let's break down the information given step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the number of students with brown eyes and black hair:**\n   We know that half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. We are also given that there are 6 students with brown eyes and black hair.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of students with brown eyes:**\n   Since half of the students with brown eyes have black hair, the total number of students with brown eyes must be twice the number of students with brown eyes and black hair. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of students with brown eyes} = 6 \\times 2 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total number of students in the class:**\n   We know that two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. If we let \\( T \\) be the total number of students in the class, then:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3}T = 12\n   \\]\n   To find \\( T \\), we can solve the equation by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), which is \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\):\n   \\[\n   T = 12 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 18\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of students in the class is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
