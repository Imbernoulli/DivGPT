This gives us the equation:\n\\[ s + h = 300. \\]\n\nWe are also given that Greg spent 9 more than twice as much on shoes as he did on the shirt. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ h = 2s + 9. \\]\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for \\( h \\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\\[ s + (2s + 9) = 300. \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 3s + 9 = 300. \\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate \\( s \\). We do this by subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3s = 291. \\]\n\nThen we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ s = 97. \\]\n\nSo, Greg spent \\(\\boxed{97}\\) dollars on the shirt. To verify, we can find out how much he spent on the shoes:\n\\[ h = 2s + 9 = 2(97) + 9 = 194 + 9 = 203. \\]\n\nAdding the amounts spent on the shirt and the shoes, we get:\n\\[ s + h = 97 + 203 = 300. \\]\n\nThe calculations are correct, confirming that Greg spent \\(\\boxed{97}\\) dollars on the shirt.",
