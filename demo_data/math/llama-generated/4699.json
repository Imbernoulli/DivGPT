To find the total number of aquariums she can clean, we multiply her hourly cleaning rate by the total number of hours she works:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total aquariums cleaned} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\text{ aquariums per hour}\\right) \\times 24 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\times 24 = \\frac{2 \\times 24}{3} = \\frac{48}{3} = 16\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Lucy can clean \\boxed{16} aquariums in 24 hours.",
