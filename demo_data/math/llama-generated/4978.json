        "Let's denote the number of books Matt read last year as \\( M_{\\text{last}} \\). According to the problem, Matt read 75 books this year, which is 50% more than he read last year. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ M_{\\text{this}} = M_{\\text{last}} + 0.5M_{\\text{last}} = 1.5M_{\\text{last}} \\]\n\nSince Matt read 75 books this year, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 1.5M_{\\text{last}} = 75 \\]\n\nTo find \\( M_{\\text{last}} \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:\n\n\\[ M_{\\text{last}} = \\frac{75}{1.5} = 50 \\]\n\nSo, Matt read 50 books last year.

Calculate the total number of books Pete read over both years.\n\nFirst, we know that Matt read 75 books in his second year. According to the problem, Matt read only 50% more books in his second year than he did in his first year. Let's denote the number of books Matt read in his first year as \\( M \\). Then we can write the equation for the number of books Matt read in his second year as:\n\\[ M + 0.5M = 1.5M \\]\nWe know that this equals 75, so we can solve for \\( M \\):\n\\[ 1.5M = 75 \\]\n\\[ M = \\frac{75}{1.5} \\]\n\\[ M = 50 \\]\nSo, Matt read 50 books in his first year.\n\nNext, we know that Pete read twice as many books as Matt did in his first year.

According to the problem, this year Matt read \\( M + 0.5M = 1.5M \\) books.

Use the information about Matt's reading to find out how many books Pete read last year.\n3. Determine how many books Pete read this year.\n4. Calculate the total number of books Pete read over the two years.\n\nLet's start with the information given about Matt's reading:\n- Matt read 75 books this year.\n- This year, Matt reads 50% more books than he did last year.\n\nLet \\( M_{\\text{last year}} \\) be the number of books Matt read last year. According to the problem, this year Matt reads:\n\\[ M_{\\text{this year}} = M_{\\text{last year}} + 0.5 \\times M_{\\text{last year}} = 1.5 \\times M_{\\text{last year}} \\]\n\nWe know that \\( M_{\\text{this year}} = 75 \\), so we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 1.5 \\times M_{\\text{last year}} = 75 \\]\n\nTo find \\( M_{\\text{last year}} \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:\n\\[ M_{\\text{last year}} = \\frac{75}{1.5} = 50 \\]\n\nNow we know that Matt read 50 books last year. Since Pete read twice as many books as Matt did last year, we can find the number of books Pete read last year:\n\\[ P_{\\text{last year}} = 2 \\times M_{\\text{last year}} = 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\]\n\nThis year, Pete doubles the number of books he read last year, so:\n\\[ P_{\\text{this year}} = 2 \\times P_{\\text{last year}} = 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\]\n\nTo find the total number of books Pete read across both years, we add the number of books he read last year and this year:\n\\[ P_{\\text{total}} = P_{\\text{last year}} + P_{\\text{this year}} = 100 + 200 = 300 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of books Pete read across both years is:\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]",
        "Let's start by determining how many books Matt read last year. We know that Matt read 75 books this year, which is 50% more than what he read last year. Let's denote the number of books Matt read last year as \\( M \\).\n\nSince this year Matt read 50% more books than last year, we can express this relationship as:\n\\[ 75 = M + 0.5M = 1.5M \\]\n\nTo find \\( M \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ M = \\frac{75}{1.5} = 50 \\]\n\nSo, Matt read 50 books last year.\n\nNext, we know that Pete read twice as many books as Matt did last year. Therefore, the number of books Pete read last year is:\n\\[ 2M = 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\]\n\nThis year, Pete doubles the number of books he read last year, so the number of books Pete read this year is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\]\n\nTo find the total number of books Pete read across both years, we add the number of books he read last year and this year:\n\\[ 100 + 200 = 300 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of books Pete read across both years is:\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]",

Let's denote the number of books Matt read last year as \\( M \\). According to the problem, this year Matt read \\( M + 0.5M = 1.5M \\) books.
