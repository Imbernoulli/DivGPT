        "To determine how many pencils are in each box, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pencils Arnel shared with his friends:**\n   Each friend received 8 pencils, and he has 5 friends.\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ pencils/friend} \\times 5 \\text{ friends} = 40 \\text{ pencils}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of pencils Arnel had before sharing:**\n   Arnel kept 10 pencils for himself and shared 40 pencils with his friends.\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ pencils} + 40 \\text{ pencils} = 50 \\text{ pencils}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find out how many pencils were originally in each box:**\n   Arnel had 10 boxes of pencils, and the total number of pencils was 50.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50 \\text{ pencils}}{10 \\text{ boxes}} = 5 \\text{ pencils/box}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of pencils in each box is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine how many pencils are in each box, we start by identifying the total number of pencils Arnel had before sharing any. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box by \\( x \\). Since Arnel had ten boxes of pencils, the total number of pencils he had is \\( 10x \\).\n\nNext, we know that Arnel kept ten pencils for himself and shared the remaining pencils equally with his five friends. Each friend received eight pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils shared with his friends is \\( 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\) pencils.\n\nThe total number of pencils Arnel had before sharing is equal to the sum of the pencils he kept and the pencils he shared. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ 10x = 10 + 40 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 10x = 50 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 10:\n\\[ x = \\frac{50}{10} = 5 \\]\n\nThus, the number of pencils in each box is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
