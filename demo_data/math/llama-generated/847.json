        "To determine how many of Isabella's houses are not yellow, we need to find out how many yellow and red houses she has, given the information about the green houses.\n\nFirst, we know that Isabella has three times as many green houses as yellow houses. We are given that she has 90 green houses. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of yellow houses:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of yellow houses} = \\frac{\\text{Number of green houses}}{3} = \\frac{90}{3} = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Isabella has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of red houses:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red houses} = \\text{Number of yellow houses} + 40 = 30 + 40 = 70\n\\]\n\nNow, we have the number of green houses, yellow houses, and red houses:\n- Green houses: 90\n- Yellow houses: 30\n- Red houses: 70\n\nTo find the total number of houses that are not yellow, we add the number of green houses and the number of red houses:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of houses that are not yellow} = \\text{Number of green houses} + \\text{Number of red houses} = 90 + 70 = 160\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of Isabella's houses that are not yellow is \\boxed{160}.",
        "To determine how many of Isabella's houses are not yellow, we start by defining variables for the number of each type of house. Let \\( G \\) be the number of green houses, \\( Y \\) be the number of yellow houses, and \\( R \\) be the number of red houses.\n\nWe know from the problem statement:\n1. Isabella has three times as many green houses as yellow houses, so we can write:\n   \\[\n   G = 3Y\n   \\]\n2. She has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses, so we can write:\n   \\[\n   Y = R - 40\n   \\]\n3. She has 90 green houses, so:\n   \\[\n   G = 90\n   \\]\n\nFirst, substitute the value of \\( G \\) into the first equation:\n\\[\n90 = 3Y\n\\]\nTo find \\( Y \\), divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[\nY = \\frac{90}{3} = 30\n\\]\n\nNow that we know \\( Y = 30 \\), substitute this value into the second equation to find \\( R \\):\n\\[\n30 = R - 40\n\\]\nTo find \\( R \\), add 40 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nR = 30 + 40 = 70\n\\]\n\nNow we know the number of green houses (\\( G = 90 \\)), yellow houses (\\( Y = 30 \\)), and red houses (\\( R = 70 \\)). To find the total number of houses that are not yellow, we add the number of green houses and red houses:\n\\[\nG + R = 90 + 70 = 160\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of houses that are not yellow is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
        "To determine how many of Isabella's houses are not yellow, we need to find the number of red and yellow houses she has, given the information about the green houses.\n\n1. We know that Isabella has 90 green houses. According to the problem, she has three times as many green houses as yellow houses. Let's denote the number of yellow houses by \\( y \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   90 = 3y\n   \\]\n   To find \\( y \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{90}{3} = 30\n   \\]\n   So, Isabella has 30 yellow houses.\n\n2. The problem also states that Isabella has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses. Let's denote the number of red houses by \\( r \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   y = r - 40\n   \\]\n   Since we already know that \\( y = 30 \\), we substitute 30 for \\( y \\) in the equation:\n   \\[\n   30 = r - 40\n   \\]\n   To find \\( r \\), we add 40 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   r = 30 + 40 = 70\n   \\]\n   So, Isabella has 70 red houses.\n\n3. Now, we know the number of green houses is 90, the number of yellow houses is 30, and the number of red houses is 70. To find the total number of houses that are not yellow, we add the number of green houses and the number of red houses:\n   \\[\n   90 + 70 = 160\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of Isabella's houses that are not yellow is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",

Next, we need to find the number of red houses. According to the second piece of information, the number of yellow houses is 40 fewer than the number of red houses. If we let the number of red houses be \\( r \\), we can set up the equation:\n\\[ y = r - 40 \\]\n\nSince we know \\( y = 30 \\), we substitute 30 for \\( y \\):\n\\[ 30 = r - 40 \\]\n\nTo find \\( r \\), we add 40 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ r = 30 + 40 = 70 \\]\n\nSo, Isabella has 70 red houses. Now, we need to find the total number of houses and then subtract the number of yellow houses to find out how many houses are not yellow. The total number of houses is the sum of the green houses, yellow houses, and red houses:\n\\[ \\text{Total houses} = 90 + 30 + 70 = 190 \\]\n\nThe number of houses that are not yellow is the total number of houses minus the number of yellow houses:\n\\[ \\text{Houses not yellow} = 190 - 30 = 160 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of houses that are not yellow is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",

Isabella has three times as many green houses as yellow houses.\n2. She has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses.\n\nWe are given that Isabella has 90 green houses. Therefore, we can write the first equation as:\n\\[ 90 = 3y \\]\n\nTo find the number of yellow houses, we solve for \\( y \\):\n\\[ y = \\frac{90}{3} = 30 \\]\n\nNext, we use the second piece of information to find the number of red houses. The second equation is:\n\\[ y = r - 40 \\]\n\nSince we already know that \\( y = 30 \\), we substitute 30 for \\( y \\) in the equation:\n\\[ 30 = r - 40 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( r \\), we add 40 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ r = 30 + 40 = 70 \\]\n\nNow we know the number of yellow houses is 30 and the number of red houses is 70. To find the total number of houses that are not yellow, we add the number of green houses and the number of red houses:\n\\[ 90 + 70 = 160 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of houses that are not yellow is:\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]",
