Calculate how many boys and girls left early.\n3. Subtract the number of boys and girls who left early from the initial total to find out how many remained.\n\nFirst, let's identify the number of boys and girls at the beginning of the game. We know there were 600 people in total and 240 of them were girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:\n\\[ 600 - 240 = 360 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many boys and girls left early. One-fourth of the boys left early, so the number of boys who left is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 360 = 90 \\]\nOne-eighth of the girls left early, so the number of girls who left is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{8} \\times 240 = 30 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of boys and girls who left early from the initial total to find out how many remained. The number of boys who remained is:\n\\[ 360 - 90 = 270 \\]\nThe number of girls who remained is:\n\\[ 240 - 30 = 210 \\]\nTherefore, the total number of people who remained to see the end of the game is:\n\\[ 270 + 210 = 480 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{480} \\]",
