        "To determine how far Luis will drive in 15 minutes, we first need to find his speed in miles per minute. We know that Luis drives 80 miles in 2 hours. First, we convert the time from hours to minutes:\n\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate Luis's speed in miles per minute by dividing the total distance by the total time:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{80 \\text{ miles}}{120 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{80}{120} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ miles per minute} \\]\n\nNow that we know Luis's speed is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) miles per minute, we can find out how far he will drive in 15 minutes by multiplying his speed by 15:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ miles per minute} \\times 15 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{2 \\times 15}{3} = \\frac{30}{3} = 10 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, Luis will go \\(\\boxed{10}\\) miles in 15 minutes.",
