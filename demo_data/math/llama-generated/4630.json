        "To determine the total amount Leonard and Michael spent on their presents, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchases separately and then sum the two amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Leonard's total expenditure:\n- Leonard bought a wallet for $50.\n- Leonard bought two pairs of sneakers, each costing $100. Therefore, the cost for the sneakers is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 100 = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- Adding the cost of the wallet and the sneakers gives:\n  \\[\n  50 + 200 = 250 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate Michael's total expenditure:\n- Michael bought a backpack for $100.\n- Michael bought two pairs of jeans, each costing $50. Therefore, the cost for the jeans is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 50 = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- Adding the cost of the backpack and the jeans gives:\n  \\[\n  100 + 100 = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the total expenditures of Leonard and Michael:\n\\[\n250 + 200 = 450 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount they spent in all is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{450}\n\\]",
