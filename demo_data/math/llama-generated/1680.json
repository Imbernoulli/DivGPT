        "To determine how much money Agatha has left to spend on a seat and handlebar tape, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the total amount of money Agatha has, which is $60.\n2. Subtract the cost of the frame, which is $15.\n3. Subtract the cost of the front wheel, which is $25.\n\nLet's do the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Subtract the cost of the frame from the total amount:\n   \\[\n   60 - 15 = 45\n   \\]\n   So, after buying the frame, Agatha has $45 left.\n\n2. Subtract the cost of the front wheel from the remaining amount:\n   \\[\n   45 - 25 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, after buying the front wheel, Agatha has $20 left.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Agatha has left to spend on a seat and handlebar tape is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

So, we subtract $15 from $60:\n   \\[\n   60 - 15 = 45\n   \\]\n   Now, Agatha has $45 left.\n3. She spends $25 on the front wheel. So, we subtract $25 from $45:\n   \\[\n   45 - 25 = 20\n   \\]\n   Now, Agatha has $20 left.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Agatha has left to spend on a seat and handlebar tape is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
