        "To determine how many hours Sherman drives in a week, we need to consider his daily commute to and from the office on weekdays and his driving time on weekends.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total driving time for weekdays:\n- Sherman has a 30-minute commute to the office.\n- Sherman has a 30-minute commute back home.\n- Therefore, the total commute time per day is:\n  \\[\n  30 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n- Since there are 5 weekdays, the total通ute time for the week is:\n  \\[\n  60 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 300 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's convert the total weekday driving time from minutes to hours:\n\\[\n300 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total driving time for weekends:\n- Sherman spends 2 hours each day driving his kids.\n- Since there are 2 days in the weekend, the total driving time for the weekend is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, let's add the total driving time for weekdays and weekends to find the total driving time for the entire week:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ hours} + 4 \\text{ hours} = 9 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Sherman drives in a week is \\boxed{9}.",
        "To determine how many hours Sherman drives in a week, we need to break down his driving time into parts and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Sherman's driving time for the weekdays. Sherman commutes to the office and back home every day, which means he drives for 30 minutes to the office and 30 minutes back home each day. Therefore, his total driving time per day for the weekdays is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 60 \\text{ minutes} = 1 \\text{ hour} \\]\nSince there are 5 weekdays, his total driving time for the weekdays is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ hour/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate Sherman's driving time for the weekends.

Since there are two days in the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), his total driving time for the weekends is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we add the total commute time for the weekdays and the total driving time for the weekends to find the total driving time for the entire week:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ hours} + 4 \\text{ hours} = 9 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Sherman drives in a week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]",
