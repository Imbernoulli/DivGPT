Each student needs to buy five complete uniforms, each consisting of pants, shirt, tie and socks. The pants cost $20, the shirt costs twice as much as the pants, the tie costs 1/5 as much as the shirt and the socks cost $3/pair. How many dollars will each student need to spend?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
