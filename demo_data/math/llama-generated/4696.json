        "To determine how many pages Tom would be able to read in 2 hours if he increases his reading speed by a factor of 3, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Tom's new reading speed after increasing it by a factor of 3.\n2. Determine how many pages he can read in 2 hours at his new reading speed.\n\nFirst, let's find Tom's new reading speed. approached his original reading speed of 12 pages per hour by a factor of 3:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ pages/hour} \\times 3 = 36 \\text{ pages/hour} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pages Tom can read in 2 hours at his new reading speed.
