Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the work rate of one person:**\n   - It takes one person 10 hours to solve the problem.\n   - Therefore, the work rate of one person is \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) of the problem per hour.\n\n2. **Determine the combined work rate of two people:**\n   - Since each person works at a rate of \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) of the problem per hour, two people working together will have a combined work rate of:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}\n     \\]\n   - This means that together, they can complete \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the problem per hour.\n\n3. **Calculate the time it takes for two people to complete the problem:**\n   - If their combined work rate is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the problem per hour, then the time \\(T\\) it takes for them to complete the entire problem is the reciprocal of their combined work rate:\n     \\[\n     T = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{5}} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take the two people \\(\\boxed{5}\\) hours to solve the problem together.",
        "To determine how long it will take for two people to solve the math problem together, we start by understanding the work rate of each person.\n\nFirst, we calculate the work rate of one person. Since it takes one person 10 hours to solve the problem, their work rate is:\n\\[\n\\text{Work rate of one person} = \\frac{1 \\text{ problem}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = \\frac{1}{10} \\text{ problems per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the combined work rate of two people. Since each person works at a rate of \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) problems per hour, the combined work rate of two people is:\n\\[\n\\text{Combined work rate of two people} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5} \\text{ problems per hour}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it will take for two people to complete 1 problem at their combined work rate. We do this by dividing the total work (1 problem) by their combined work rate:\n\\[\n\\text{Time taken by two people} = \\frac{1 \\text{ problem}}{\\frac{1}{5} \\text{ problems per hour}} = 1 \\times \\frac{5}{1} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take the two people \\(\\boxed{5}\\) hours to solve the problem together.",
