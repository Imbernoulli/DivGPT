Therefore, the number of people on the fourth bus is:\n   \\[\n   12 + 9 = 21\n   \\]\n\nNext, we sum the number of people on all four buses to find the total number of people going to the museum:\n\\[\n12 + 24 + 18 + 21 = 75\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of people going to the museum is \\boxed{75}.",
