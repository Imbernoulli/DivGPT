        "To determine how many hours ahead Yara will be compared to Theon, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to reach their destination and then find the difference between these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Theon to reach the destination. Theon's ship moves at a speed of 15 nautical miles per hour, and the destination is 90 nautical miles away. The time \\( t_{\\text{Theon}} \\) it takes for Theon to reach the destination is given by the formula:\n\\[\nt_{\\text{Theon}} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{90 \\text{ nautical miles}}{15 \\text{ nautical miles per hour}} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Yara to reach the destination. Yara's ship moves at a speed of 30 nautical miles per hour, and the destination is 90 nautical miles away. The time \\( t_{\\text{Yara}} \\) it takes for Yara to reach the destination is given by the formula:\n\\[\nt_{\\text{Yara}} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{90 \\text{ nautical miles}}{30 \\text{ nautical miles per hour}} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the difference in time between Theon and Yara. This difference is:\n\\[\nt_{\\text{Theon}} - t_{\\text{Yara}} = 6 \\text{ hours} - 3 \\text{ hours} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Yara will be ahead of Theon by \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours.",

        "To determine how many hours ahead Yara will be compared to Theon, we need to calculate the travel time for each of them and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the travel time for Theon. Theon's ship moves at a speed of 15 nautical miles per hour. The distance to their destination is 90 nautical miles. The formula for time is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n\\]\n\nSo, for Theon:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_{\\text{Theon}} = \\frac{90 \\text{ nautical miles}}{15 \\text{ nautical miles per hour}} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the travel time for Yara. Yara's ship moves at a speed of 30 nautical miles per hour. The distance to their destination is also 90 nautical miles. Using the same formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_{\\text{Yara}} = \\frac{90 \\text{ nautical miles}}{30 \\text{ nautical miles per hour}} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in their travel times:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Time}_{\\text{Theon}} - \\text{Time}_{\\text{Yara}} = 6 \\text{ hours} - 3 \\text{ hours} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Yara will be \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours ahead of Theon.",
