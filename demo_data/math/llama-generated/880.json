        "To determine how many hotdogs the third competitor can eat after 5 minutes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the hotdog eating rate of the second competitor.\n2. Calculate the hotdog eating rate of the third competitor.\n3. Calculate the total number of hotdogs the third competitor can eat in 5 minutes.\n\nFirst, let's find the hotdog eating rate of the second competitor. The second competitor can eat 3 times more than the first competitor. Since the first competitor can eat 10 hotdogs per minute, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Hotdog eating rate of the second competitor} = 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ hotdogs per minute} \\]\n\nNext, let's find the hotdog eating rate of the third competitor. The third competitor can eat twice as much as the second competitor. Since the second competitor can eat 30 hotdogs per minute, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Hotdog eating rate of the third competitor} = 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\text{ hotdogs per minute} \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of hotdogs the third competitor can eat in 5 minutes. Since the third competitor can eat 60 hotdogs per minute, in 5 minutes he can eat:\n\\[ \\text{Total hotdogs eaten by the third competitor in 5 minutes} = 60 \\times 5 = 300 \\text{ hotdogs} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hotdogs the third competitor can eat after 5 minutes is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",

Calculate the hotdog eating rate of the third competitor.\n3. Determine the total number of hotdogs the third competitor can eat in 5 minutes.\n\nFirst, we know the first competitor can eat 10 hot dogs per minute. The second competitor can eat 3 times more than the first competitor. Therefore, the hotdog eating rate of the second competitor is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ hot dogs/minute} \\times 3 = 30 \\text{ hot dogs/minute} \\]\n\nNext, the third competitor can eat twice as much as the second competitor.
