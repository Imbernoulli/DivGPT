He decides to go to a cobbler and get them handmade.  The cobbler charges $250 to make the mold.  He then charges $75 an hour for 8 hours to make the shoes.  The cobbler agrees to only charge 80% of the cost for work to make the shoes, since it is his first pair of shoes.  How much did Bobby pay?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
