It takes him 20 minutes to saute the onions and a quarter of that time to saute the garlic and peppers. It takes him 30 minutes to knead the dough, twice as long to let it rest, and 1/10th the combined kneading and resting time to assemble the calzones. How many minutes does Marcus spend on the calzones total?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
