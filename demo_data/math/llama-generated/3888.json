        "To determine the total cost of purchasing 10 triple cheese pizzas and 9 meat lovers pizzas using the special pricing, we will calculate the cost for each type of pizza separately and then sum the two amounts.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the triple cheese pizzas.**\n\nThe buy-1-get-1-free special means that for every two pizzas, you pay for one. Therefore, we need to find out how many sets of two pizzas are in 10 pizzas.\n\n\\[ \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\]\n\nThis means we pay for 5 pizzas and get 5 pizzas for free. The cost for 5 pizzas at $5 each is:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\]\n\nSo, the cost for 10 triple cheese pizzas is $25.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the meat lovers pizzas.**\n\nThe buy-2-get-1-free special means that for every three pizzas, you pay for two. Therefore, we need to find out how many sets of three pizzas are in 9 pizzas.\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\]\n\nThis means we pay for 6 pizzas and get 3 pizzas for free. The cost for 6 pizzas at $5 each is:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\]\n\nSo, the cost for 9 meat lovers pizzas is $30.\n\n**Step 3: Add the costs of the triple cheese pizzas and the meat lovers pizzas.**\n\n\\[ 25 + 30 = 55 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost to purchase 10 triple cheese and 9 meat lovers pizzas using the special pricing is \\(\\boxed{55}\\).",
