        "To determine how many minutes it takes Marcy to drink the whole 2-liter bottle of water, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert liters to milliliters:**\n   Since 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, a 2-liter bottle contains:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ liters} \\times 1000 \\text{ ml/liter} = 2000 \\text{ ml}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of sips needed:**\n   Each sip is 40 milliliters.

        "To determine how many minutes it takes Marcy to drink the entire 2-liter bottle of water, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the volume of the bottle from liters to milliliters.\n2. Calculate the total number of sips required to drink the bottle.\n3. Determine the total time taken to drink the bottle.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the volume of the bottle from liters to milliliters.**\n\nWe know that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters. Therefore, a 2-liter bottle is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ liters} \\times 1000 \\text{ ml/liter} = 2000 \\text{ ml} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of sips required to drink the bottle.**\n\nEach sip is 40 milliliters. To find out how many sips are needed to drink 2000 milliliters, we divide the total volume of the bottle by the volume of each sip:\n\\[ 2000 \\text{ ml} \\div 40 \\text{ ml/sip} = 50 \\text{ sips} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total time taken to drink the bottle.**\n\nMarcy takes a sip every 5 minutes. To find out how many minutes it takes to drink 50 sips, we multiply the number of sips by the time taken for each sip:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ sips} \\times 5 \\text{ minutes/sip} = 250 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Marcy \\(\\boxed{250}\\) minutes to drink the whole bottle of water.",
