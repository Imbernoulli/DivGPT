        "To determine how many counselors Camp Cedar needs, we first need to find out the total number of children at the camp. We know there are 40 boys and 3 times as many girls. Therefore, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of girls} = 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of children by adding the number of boys and the number of girls:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of children} = 40 + 120 = 160 \\]\n\nThe camp needs 1 counselor for every 8 children. To find out how many counselors are needed, we divide the total number of children by 8:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of counselors} = \\frac{160}{8} = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the number of counselors Camp Cedar needs is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
