But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.

        "To determine how many kilometers the ship was blown in a westward direction by the storm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total distance to the destination:**\n   - The Skipper持久 zipper一半 of the distance to the destination.\n   - He traveled due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour.\n   - Distance traveled east: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 30 \\, \\text{km/h} \\times 20 \\, \\text{h} = 600 \\, \\text{km}\n     \\]\n   - Since this distance is half of the total distance to the destination:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total distance} = 600 \\, \\text{km} \\times 2 = 1200 \\, \\text{km}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the distance the ship should have traveled:**\n   -

Therefore, the distance traveled east is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ hours} \\times 30 \\text{ km/h} = 600 \\text{ km}\n\\]\nSince this is half the distance to the destination, the total distance to the destination is:\n\\[\n600 \\text{ km} \\times 2 = 1200 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that after the storm, the Skipper was only one-third of the way to his destination. Therefore, the distance he had traveled after the storm is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1200 \\text{ km} = 400 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nSince the Skipper initially traveled 600 km east, the distance he traveled west after the storm is:\n\\[\n600 \\text{ km} - 400 \\text{ km} = 200 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nThus, the ship was blown in a westward direction by the storm for:\n\\[\n\\boxed{200}\n\\] kilometers.",
        "To determine how many kilometers the ship was blown in a westward direction by the storm, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total distance to the destination:**\n   - The Skipper日常_act his ship halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour.\n   - Distance traveled east: \\( 20 \\text{ hours} \\times 30 \\text{ kilometers/hour} = 600 \\text{ kilometers} \\).\n   - Since this is halfway to the destination, the total distance to the destination is \\( 600 \\text{ kilometers} \\times 2 = 1200 \\text{ kilometers} \\).\n\n2. **Determine the position of the ship after the storm:**\n   - After the storm, the Skipper was only one-third of the way to his destination.\n   - One-third of the total distance: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1200 \\text{ kilometers} = 400 \\text{ kilometers} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the distance the ship was blown westward:**\n   - Initially, the ship was 600 kilometers east of the starting point.\n   - After the storm, the ship was 400 kilometers east of the starting point.\n   - Distance blown westward: \\( 600 \\text{ kilometers} - 400 \\text{ kilometers} = 200 \\text{ kilometers} \\).\n\nThus, the ship was blown \\(\\boxed{200}\\) kilometers in a westward direction by the storm.",

Calculate the distance the ship traveled east on the first day.\n2. Determine the distance the ship should have traveled to be halfway to the destination.\n3. Determine the distance the ship should have traveled to be one-third of the way to the destination.\n4. Calculate the distance the ship was blown westward.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the distance the ship traveled east on the first day.**\n\nThe ship traveled due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour.\n\\[\n\\text{Distance traveled east} = 20 \\text{ hours} \\times 30 \\text{ km/h} = 600 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the distance the ship should have traveled to be halfway to the destination.**\n\nLet \\( D \\) be the total distance to the destination. Since the ship traveled halfway to the destination on the first day, the distance traveled halfway is:\n\\[\n\\frac{D}{2}\n\\]\nWe know that the ship traveled 600 km east, so:\n\\[\n\\frac{D}{2} = 600 \\text{ km}\n\\]\nSolving for \\( D \\):\n\\[\nD = 600 \\text{ km} \\times 2 = 1200 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the distance the ship should have traveled to be one-third of the way to the destination.**\n\nThe distance to be one-third of the way to the destination is:\n\\[\n\\frac{D}{3} = \\frac{1200 \\text{ km}}{3} = 400 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the distance the ship was blown westward.**\n\nAfter the storm, the ship was only 400 km from the starting point. Since the ship initially traveled 600 km east, the distance it was blown westward is:\n\\[\n600 \\text{ km} - 400 \\text{ km} = 200 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nThus, the ship was blown \\(\\boxed{200}\\) kilometers in a westward direction by the storm."
