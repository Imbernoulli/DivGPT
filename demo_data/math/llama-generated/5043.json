We know that every 100 drops equal 5 ml of liquid. Therefore, we can find out how many milliliters are in 1 drop by dividing 5 ml by 100 drops:\n\\[ \\frac{5 \\text{ ml}}{100 \\text{ drops}} = 0.05 \\text{ ml/drop} \\]\n\nTo find the total number of milliliters in 2400 drops, we multiply the number of drops by the amount of liquid per drop:\n\\[ 2400 \\text{ drops} \\times 0.05 \\text{ ml/drop} = 120 \\text{ ml} \\]\n\nSo, the patient will receive \\(\\boxed{120}\\) milliliters of treatment after the 2 hours have passed.",

Convert the total number of drops into milliliters.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of drops in 2 hours.**\n\n- The drip rate is 20 drops per minute.\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n- The treatment lasts for 2 hours.\n\nFirst, find the total number of drops in one hour:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ drops/minute} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 1200 \\text{ drops/hour} \\]\n\nNext, find the total number of drops in 2 hours:\n\\[ 1200 \\text{ drops/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 2400 \\text{ drops} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Convert the total number of drops into milliliters.**\n\n- Every 100 drops equal 5 ml of liquid.\n- We need to find out how many milliliters are in 2400 drops.\n\nFirst, determine how many sets of 100 drops are in 2400 drops:\n\\[ \\frac{2400 \\text{ drops}}{100 \\text{ drops/set}} = 24 \\text{ sets} \\]\n\nNext, convert the number of sets into milliliters:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ sets} \\times 5 \\text{ ml/set} = 120 \\text{ ml} \\]\n\nTherefore, the patient will receive \\(\\boxed{120}\\) milliliters of treatment after 2 hours.",

Calculate the total number of drops the patient receives in 2 hours.\n2. Convert the total number of drops into milliliters.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of drops in 2 hours.**\n\nFirst, we find out how many minutes are in 2 hours:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of drops in 120 minutes. Since the drip rate is 20 drops per minute, we multiply the number of minutes by the drop rate:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ minutes} \\times 20 \\text{ drops/minute} = 2400 \\text{ drops} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Convert the total number of drops into milliliters.**\n\nWe know that every 100 drops equal 5 ml of liquid. To find out how many milliliters are in 2400 drops, we set up a proportion:\n\\[ \\frac{5 \\text{ ml}}{100 \\text{ drops}} = \\frac{x \\text{ ml}}{2400 \\text{ drops}} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[ x = \\frac{5 \\text{ ml} \\times 2400 \\text{ drops}}{100 \\text{ drops}} = \\frac{12000 \\text{ ml}}{100} = 120 \\text{ ml} \\]\n\nTherefore, the patient will receive \\(\\boxed{120}\\) milliliters of treatment after the 2 hours have passed.",
