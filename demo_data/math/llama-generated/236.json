Calculate the cost of the cafe lattes:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ cafe lattes} \\times \\$1.5 \\text{ per cafe latte} = \\$3\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the cost of the espressos:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ espressos} \\times \\$1 \\text{ per espresso} = \\$2\n   \\]\n\nNext, we sum the costs of all the drinks:\n\\[\n\\$6 + \\$6 + \\$3 + \\$2 = \\$17\n\\]\n\nSandy paid with a twenty-dollar bill, so we subtract the total cost of the drinks from the amount she paid to find the change:\n\\[\n\\$20 - \\$17 = \\$3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of change Sandy receives is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
        "To determine how much change Sandy receives, we need to calculate the total cost of the drinks she ordered and then subtract that from the amount she paid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of each type of drink:\n- Cappuccinos: Sandy orders three cappuccinos, and each cappuccino costs $2.\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ cappuccinos} \\times \\$2/\\text{cappuccino} = \\$6\n  \\]\n\n- Iced teas: Sandy orders two iced teas, and each iced tea costs $3.\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ iced teas} \\times \\$3/\\text{iced tea} = \\$6\n  \\]\n\n- Cafe lattes: Sandy orders two cafe lattes, and each cafe latte costs $1.5.\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ cafe lattes} \\times \\$1.5/\\text{cafe latte} = \\$3\n  \\]\n\n- Espressos: Sandy orders two espressos, and each espresso costs $1.\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ espressos} \\times \\$1/\\text{espresso} = \\$2\n  \\]\n\nNext, we sum the costs of all the drinks:\n\\[\n\\$6 + \\$6 + \\$3 + \\$2 = \\$17\n\\]\n\nSandy paid with a twenty-dollar bill, so we subtract the total cost of the drinks from $20 to find the change:\n\\[\n\\$20 - \\$17 = \\$3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the change Sandy receives is \\boxed{3}."
