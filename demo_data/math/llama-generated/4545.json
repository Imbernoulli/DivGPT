        "To determine the total number of miles Wanda walks after 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Wanda walks in one day. She walks her daughter to school in the morning and then walks her daughter home. This is a total of:\n\\[ 0.5 \\text{ miles} + 0.5 \\text{ miles} = 1 \\text{ mile} \\]\n She repeats this in the afternoon, so the total distance she walks in one day is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ mile} + 1 \\text{ mile} = 2 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the distance Wanda walks in one week. She walks her daughter to school and back home 5 days a week, so the total distance she walks in one week is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 10 \\text{ miles/week} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the distance Wanda walks in 4 weeks. She walks her daughter to school and back home for 4 weeks, so the total distance she walks in 4 weeks is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ miles/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 40 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of miles Wanda walks after 4 weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
        "To determine how many miles Wanda walks after 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Wanda walks in one day. She walks 0.5 miles to school in the morning and 0.5 miles back home, which totals:\n\\[ 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \\text{ mile} \\]\n\n She repeats this process in the afternoon, so she walks another 1 mile. Therefore, the total distance Wanda walks in one day is:\n\\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many miles Wanda walks in one week. Since she walks 2 miles each day and she does this for 5 days a week, the total distance she walks in one week is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the total distance Wanda walks in 4 weeks. Since she walks 10 miles each week, the total distance she walks in 4 weeks is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of miles Wanda walks after 4 weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
