        "To determine the total number of pieces of mail Lauren sent over the four days, we need to calculate the number of pieces sent each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many pieces of mail Lauren sent on each day:\n\n1. **Monday**: Lauren sent 65 pieces of mail.\n2. **Tuesday**: Lauren sent 10 more pieces of mail than on Monday. Therefore, the number of pieces sent on Tuesday is:\n   \\[\n   65 + 10 = 75\n   \\]\n3. **Wednesday**: Lauren sent 5 fewer pieces of mail than on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of pieces sent on Wednesday is:\n   \\[\n   75 - 5 = 70\n   \\]\n4. **Thursday**: Lauren sent 15 more pieces of mail than on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of pieces sent on Thursday is:\n   \\[\n   70 + 15 = 85\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of pieces sent each day to find the total number of pieces of mail sent over the four days:\n\\[\n65 + 75 + 70 + 85\n\\]\n\nWe can add these numbers step by step:\n\\[\n65 + 75 = 140\n\\]\n\\[\n140 + 70 = 210\n\\]\n\\[\n210 + 85 = 295\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pieces of mail Lauren sent is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{295}\n\\]",
