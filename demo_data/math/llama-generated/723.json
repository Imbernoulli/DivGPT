        "To determine the longest boat Mitch can buy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount Mitch needs to set aside for non-boat expenses:**\n   - Mitch needs to keep $500 for a license and registration.\n   - Mitch needs to keep three times that amount for docking fees.\n\n   First, calculate the docking fees:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 500 = 1500\n   \\]\n\n   Now, add the license and registration fee to the docking fees:\n   \\[\n   500 + 1500 = 2000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the total non-boat expenses from Mitch's total savings:**\n   - Mitch has saved $20000.\n   \\[\n   20000 - 2000 = 18000\n   \\]\n\n   This means Mitch has $18000 available to spend on the boat.\n\n3. **Determine the cost per foot of the boat:**\n   - The cost is $1500 per foot.\n\n4. **Calculate the maximum length of the boat Mitch can buy:**\n   - Divide the available amount by the cost per foot:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{18000}{1500} = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the longest boat Mitch can buy is \\boxed{12} feet.",
        "First, we need to determine how much money Mitch has left after setting aside money for the license and registration, and docking fees. The license and registration cost $500, and the docking fees are three times that amount, which is $3 \\times 500 = 1500$. Therefore, the total amount of money Mitch needs to set aside for these expenses is $500 + 1500 = 2000$.\n\nNext, we subtract this amount from Mitch's total savings to find out how much money he has left to spend on the boat. Mitch's total savings is $20000$, so after setting aside $2000$, he has $20000 - 2000 = 18000$ dollars left.\n\nThe cost of the boat is $1500$ per foot. To find out how many feet is the longest boat Mitch can buy, we divide the amount of money he has left by the cost per foot: $18000 \\div 1500 = 12$.

        "To determine the longest boat Mitch can buy, we need to first calculate how much money Mitch can allocate for the boat itself. Mitch has saved $20,000, but he needs to keep $500 for a license and registration, and three times that amount for docking fees. Let's calculate the total amount of money he needs to set aside for these expenses:\n\n\\[\n500 + 3 \\times 500 = 500 + 1500 = 2000\n\\]\n\nSo, Mitch can spend $20,000 - $2000 = $18,000 on the boat. The cost of the boat is $1500 per foot, so we need to find out how many feet of boat he can buy with $18,000:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18000}{1500} = 12\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the longest boat Mitch can buy is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) feet.",
        "To determine the longest boat Mitch can buy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Mitch needs to set aside for license and registration, and docking fees.\n2. Subtract this total amount from Mitch's initial savings.\n3. Determine how many feet of boat Mitch can buy with the remaining money.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Mitch needs to set aside:\n- Mitch needs $500 for a license and registration.\n- Mitch needs three times $500 for docking fees, which is \\(3 \\times 500 = 1500\\).\n- Therefore, the total amount Mitch needs to set aside is \\(500 + 1500 = 2000\\).\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount Mitch needs to set aside from his initial savings:\n- Mitch's initial savings is $20000.\n- After setting aside $2000, Mitch has \\(20000 - 2000 = 18000\\) dollars left.\n\nFinally, we determine how many feet of boat Mitch can buy with the remaining $18000. Since the cost of the boat is $1500 per foot, we divide $18000 by $1500:\n\\[ \\frac{18000}{1500} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the longest boat Mitch can buy is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) feet."
