        "To determine the percentage of Carla's seeds that come from the dandelions, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of seeds from the sunflowers.\n2. Calculate the total number of seeds from the dandelions.\n3. Find the total number of seeds from both the sunflowers and the dandelions.\n4. Calculate the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Carla has 6 sunflowers, and each sunflower has 9 seeds. Therefore, the total number of seeds from the sunflowers is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 9 = 54 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of seeds from the dandelions. Carla has 8 dandelions, and each dandelion has 12 seeds. Therefore, the total number of seeds from the dandelions is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 12 = 96 \\]\n\nNow, we find the total number of seeds from both the sunflowers and the dandelions. This is the sum of the seeds from the sunflowers and the seeds from the dandelions:\n\\[ 54 + 96 = 150 \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions. This is done by dividing the number of seeds from the dandelions by the total number of seeds, and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{96}{150} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{16}{25} \\right) \\times 100 = 64\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of Carla's seeds that come from the dandelions is:\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]",

Adding the seeds from the sunflowers and the seeds from the dandelions, we get:\n\\[\n54 + 96 = 150\n\\]\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions. The number of seeds from the dandelions is 96, and the total number of seeds is 150. The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of seeds from the dandelions by the total number of seeds and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{96}{150} \\right) \\times 100 = 64\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of Carla's seeds that come from the dandelions is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{64}\n\\]",

Determine the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of seeds from the sunflowers. Carla has 6 sunflowers, and each sunflower has 9 seeds. Therefore, the total number of seeds from the sunflowers is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 9 = 54 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of seeds from the dandelions. Carla has 8 dandelions, and each dandelion has 12 seeds. Therefore, the total number of seeds from the dandelions is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 12 = 96 \\]\n\nNow, we find the total number of seeds from both the sunflowers and the dandelions. This is the sum of the seeds from the sunflowers and the seeds from the dandelions:\n\\[ 54 + 96 = 150 \\]\n\nFinally, we determine the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions.

Therefore, the total number of seeds from the dandelions is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 12 = 96 \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total number of seeds from both the sunflowers and the dandelions. This is the sum of the seeds from the sunflowers and the seeds from the dandelions:\n\\[ 54 + 96 = 150 \\]\n\nFinally, we need to determine the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions. The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of seeds from the dandelions by the total number of seeds, and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{96}{150} \\right) \\times 100 = 64\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of Carla's seeds that come from the dandelions is:\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]",

Determine the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of seeds from the sunflowers.**\n\nCarla has 6 sunflowers, and each sunflower has 9 seeds. Therefore, the total number of seeds from the sunflowers is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 9 = 54 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of seeds from the dandelions.**\n\nCarla has 8 dandelions, and each dandelion has 12 seeds. Therefore, the total number of seeds from the dandelions is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 12 = 96 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the total number of seeds from both the sunflowers and the dandelions.**\n\nThe total number of seeds is the sum of the seeds from the sunflowers and the seeds from the dandelions:\n\\[ 54 + 96 = 150 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions.**\n\nTo find the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{\\text{number of seeds from dandelions}}{\\text{total number of seeds}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{96}{150} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{96}{150}\\). The greatest common divisor of 96 and 150 is 6, so:\n\\[ \\frac{96 \\div 6}{150 \\div 6} = \\frac{16}{25} \\]\n\nNow, convert the fraction \\(\\frac{16}{25}\\) to a percentage:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{16}{25} \\right) \\times 100 = 16 \\times 4 = 64 \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of Carla's seeds that come from the dandelions is:\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]",
        "To determine the percentage of Carla's seeds that come from the dandelions, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of seeds from the sunflowers.\n2. Calculate the total number of seeds from the dandelions.\n3. Find the total number of seeds from all the plants.\n4. Determine the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of seeds from the sunflowers. Carla has 6 sunflowers, and each sunflower has 9 seeds:\n\\[\n6 \\times 9 = 54\n\\]\nSo, the total number of seeds from the sunflowers is 54.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of seeds from the dandelions. Carla has 8 dandelions, and each dandelion has 12 seeds:\n\\[\n8 \\times 12 = 96\n\\]\nSo, the total number of seeds from the dandelions is 96.\n\nNow, we find the total number of seeds from all the plants by adding the seeds from the sunflowers and the seeds from the dandelions:\n\\[\n54 + 96 = 150\n\\]\nSo, the total number of seeds is 150.\n\nFinally, we determine the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions. We do this by dividing the number of seeds from the dandelions by the total number of seeds, and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{96}{150} \\right) \\times 100 = 64\n\\]\nSo, the percentage of Carla's seeds that come from the dandelions is \\(\\boxed{64}\\)."
