        "First, let's determine the initial number of each type of silverware Carolyn buys. She has 6 knives, 12 forks, and three times as many spoons as knives. Since she has 6 knives, the number of spoons she has is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\]\n\nSo initially, Carolyn has:\n- 6 knives\n- 12 forks\n- 18 spoons\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of pieces of silverware she has initially:\n\n\\[ 6 + 12 + 18 = 36 \\]\n\nThen, Carolyn trades her friend 10 knives for 6 spoons. After this trade, the number of knives she has is:\n\n\\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \\]\n\nAnd the number of spoons she has is:\n\n\\[ 18 - 6 = 12 \\]\n\nThe number of forks remains unchanged at 12. So after the trade, Carolyn has:\n- 16 knives\n- 12 forks\n- 12 spoons\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of pieces of silverware she has after the trade:\n\n\\[ 16 + 12 + 12 = 40 \\]\n\nTo find the percentage of Carolyn's silverware that is knives, we use the formula for percentage:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{\\text{number of knives}}{\\text{total number of pieces of silverware}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{16}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.4 \\times 100 = 40\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of Carolyn's silverware that is knives is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
