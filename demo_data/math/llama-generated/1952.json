        "To determine the length of Jenna's eel, we start by defining the length of Bill's eel as \\( B \\) inches.

Therefore, we can write the following equation to represent the total length:\n\n\\[ B + \\frac{1}{3}B = 64 \\]\n\nTo combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1 and 3 is 3, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3B}{3} + \\frac{1B}{3} = 64 \\]\n\nCombining the fractions gives:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4B}{3} = 64 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( B \\), we need to eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ 4B = 64 \\times 3 \\]\n\\[ 4B = 192 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( B \\) by dividing both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{192}{4} \\]\n\\[ B = 48 \\]\n\nSo, Bill's eel is 48 inches long.
