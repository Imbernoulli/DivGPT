He gave 3 to his mom, 3 to his sister, 5 to his grandmother, and 2 to his dog. So, we add these amounts together:\n\\[ 3 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 13 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total number of dandelion puffs given away from the original number of dandelion puffs. Caleb originally picked 40 dandelion puffs, so we have:\n\\[ 40 - 13 = 27 \\]\n\nNow, we need to divide the remaining 27 dandelion puffs equally among his 3 friends. We do this by dividing 27 by 3:\n\\[ 27 \\div 3 = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, each friend received \\(\\boxed{9}\\) dandelion puffs.",
