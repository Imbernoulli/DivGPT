        "To determine how much Jaco will pay for the items, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of all the items before the discount.\n2. Determine if the total cost exceeds $100 and, if so, calculate the discount.\n3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jaco will pay.\n\nLet's start by calculating the total cost of all the items:\n- The cost of the shoes is $74.\n- The cost of the 2 pairs of socks is $2 per pair, so $2 * 2 = $4.\n- The cost of the bag is $42.\n\nAdding these amounts together gives:\n\\[ 74 + 4 + 42 = 120 \\]\n\nThe total cost of the items is $120. Since $120 exceeds $100, Jaco will get a 10% discount on the amount exceeding $100. The amount exceeding $100 is:\n\\[ 120 - 100 = 20 \\]\n\nThe discount is 10% of $20:\n\\[ 0.10 * 20 = 2 \\]\n\nSubtracting the discount from the total cost gives:\n\\[ 120 - 2 = 118 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jaco will pay \\(\\boxed{118}\\) dollars.",
