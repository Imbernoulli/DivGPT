Connie used all the money she had been given to buy some land.  In one year, the land tripled in value.  So, she sold the land and gave half of all the money she got from the sale of the land to Blake.  If Connie gave Blake $30,000, how much money, in dollars, did Blake initially give to Connie?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how much money Blake initially gave to Connie, we need to follow the steps of the transaction and work backwards.\n\n1. **Determine the total value of the land after it tripled in value:**\n   - Connie sold the land and received an amount that is three times the initial amount she paid for the land. Let \\( x \\) be the initial amount Blake gave to Connie.\n   - Therefore, the total value of the land after it tripled is \\( 3x \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the amount Connie gave to Blake:**\n   - Connie sold the land and gave half of the total value to Blake. According to the problem, she gave Blake $30,000.\n   - So, half of the total value of the land is \\( \\frac{3x}{2} \\).\n   - We set up the equation: \\[\n     \\frac{3x}{2} = 30,000\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - To isolate \\( x \\), multiply both sides of the equation by 2: \\[\n     3x = 60,000\n     \\]\n   - Then, divide both sides by 3: \\[\n     x = 20,000\n     \\]\n\nThus, Blake initially gave Connie \\(\\boxed{20000}\\) dollars.",

After one year, the value of the land tripled. Therefore, the value of the land after one year is \\( 3x \\) dollars. Connie then sold the land and gave half of the money she got from the sale of the land to Blake. This means she gave Blake \\( \\frac{3x}{2} \\) dollars. We know from the problem that Connie gave Blake $30,000. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3x}{2} = 30000\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve this equation. First, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[\n3x = 60000\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nx = 20000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Blake initially gave to Connie is \\(\\boxed{20000}\\).",
