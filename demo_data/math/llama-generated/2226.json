        "To determine the total number of apples Kylie picked, we need to calculate the number of apples she picked each hour and then sum them up.\n\n1. In the first hour, Kylie picks 66 apples.\n2. In the second hour, she doubles her apple picking rate. Therefore, she picks \\(66 \\times 2 = 132\\) apples.\n3. In the third hour, she picks a third of the apples picked in the first hour. Therefore, she picks \\(66 \\div 3 = 22\\) apples.\n\nNow, we sum the apples picked each hour:\n\\[66 + 132 + 22 = 220\\]\n\nSo, the total number of apples Kylie picked is \\(\\boxed{220}\\).",
