        "To determine how many ounces of oil Sonja used in her last batch of peanut butter, we need to start by understanding the ratio of oil to peanuts. The ratio given is 2 ounces of oil for every 8 ounces of peanuts. This can be simplified to 1 ounce of oil for every 4 ounces of peanuts.\n\nNext, let's denote the amount of oil used as \\( O \\) and the amount of peanuts used as \\( P \\). According to the ratio, we have:\n\\[ O = \\frac{1}{4}P \\]\n\nThe total weight of the peanut butter batch is the sum of the weight of the oil and the weight of the peanuts, which is given as 20 ounces. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ O + P = 20 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\( O \\) from the ratio into the total weight equation, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4}P + P = 20 \\]\n\nTo combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4}P + \\frac{4}{4}P = 20 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{5}{4}P = 20 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( P \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\), which is \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\):\n\\[ P = 20 \\times \\frac{4}{5} \\]\n\\[ P = 16 \\]\n\nNow that we know the amount of peanuts used is 16 ounces, we can find the amount of oil used by substituting \\( P = 16 \\) back into the ratio expression:\n\\[ O = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 \\]\n\\[ O = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ounces of oil Sonja used is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
        "To determine how many ounces of oil Sonja used in her last batch of peanut butter, we start by understanding the given ratio of oil to peanuts. The ratio is 2 ounces of oil to 8 ounces of peanuts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of the mixture in terms of the ratio:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ ounces of oil} + 8 \\text{ ounces of peanuts} = 10 \\text{ ounces of mixture}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Sonja's last batch of peanut butter weighs 20 ounces. We need to find out how many times the ratio fits into the total weight of the batch. We do this by dividing the total weight of the batch by the total weight of the ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{20 \\text{ ounces}}{10 \\text{ ounces of mixture}} = 2\n\\]\n\nThis means that the ratio of 2 ounces of oil to 8 ounces of peanuts is applied twice in the 20-ounce batch.\n\nNow, we calculate the amount of oil used by multiplying the amount of oil in one ratio by the number of times the ratio is applied:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ ounces of oil} \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ ounces of oil}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of ounces of oil Sonja used is \\boxed{4}.",

This can be simplified to 1 ounce of oil for every 4 ounces of peanuts.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many ounces of peanuts are in the 20-ounce batch of peanut butter. Since the total weight of the peanut butter is the sum of the weight of the peanuts and the weight of the oil, we can set up the following relationship:\n\nLet \\( p \\) be the weight of the peanuts in ounces. According to the ratio, the weight of the oil is \\( \\frac{p}{4} \\) ounces. Therefore, the total weight of the peanut butter is:\n\\[ p + \\frac{p}{4} = 20 \\]\n\nTo combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:\n\\[ \\frac{4p}{4} + \\frac{p}{4} = 20 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{5p}{4} = 20 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( p \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[ 5p = 80 \\]\n\\[ p = 16 \\]\n\nSo, there are 16 ounces of peanuts in the 20-ounce batch. Since the ratio of oil to peanuts is 1 ounce of oil for every 4 ounces of peanuts, the weight of the oil is:\n\\[ \\frac{16}{4} = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, Sonja used \\(\\boxed{4}\\) ounces of oil.",

        "To determine how many ounces of oil Sonja used in her last batch of peanut butter, we start by understanding the given ratio of oil to peanuts. The ratio is 2 ounces of oil for every 8 ounces of peanuts. This can be simplified to a ratio of 1 ounce of oil for every 4 ounces of peanuts.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many ounces of peanuts are in the 20-ounce batch of peanut butter. Since the total weight of the peanut butter is the sum of the weights of the peanuts and the oil, we can express the weight of the peanuts as \\( x \\) ounces and the weight of the oil as \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\) ounces (because the ratio of oil to peanuts is 1:4).\n\nThe total weight of the peanut butter is given by:\n\\[ x + \\frac{x}{4} = 20 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation by finding a common denominator:\n\\[ \\frac{4x}{4} + \\frac{x}{4} = 20 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{5x}{4} = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[ 5x = 80 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 5:\n\\[ x = 16 \\]\n\nSo, Sonja used 16 ounces of peanuts. Since the ratio of oil to peanuts is 1:4, the amount of oil she used is:\n\\[ \\frac{16}{4} = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ounces of oil Sonja used is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]",
        "To determine how many ounces of oil Sonja used in her last batch of peanut butter, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the ratio of oil to peanuts.\n2. Determine the total weight of the peanuts in the batch.\n3. Calculate the amount of oil based on the ratio.\n\nThe ratio given is 2 ounces of oil to 8 ounces of peanuts. This can be written as:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio of oil to peanuts} = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nThis means that for every 1 ounce of oil, there are 4 ounces of peanuts. In other words, the total weight of the peanut butter batch can be divided into 5 parts (1 part oil and 4 parts peanuts).\n\nThe last batch of peanut butter weighed 20 ounces. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion to find out how many ounces of oil were used:\n\\[ \\text{Total weight of batch} = \\text{Weight of oil} + \\text{Weight of peanuts} = 5x \\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the weight of one part of the mixture. Since the total weight of the batch is 20 ounces, we have:\n\\[ 5x = 20 \\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{20}{5} = 4 \\]\n\nThis means that each part of the mixture weighs 4 ounces. Since the oil makes up 1 part of the mixture, the weight of the oil is:\n\\[ \\text{Weight of oil} = 1x = 4 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ounces of oil Sonja used is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]",
        "To determine how many ounces of oil Sonja used in her last batch of peanut butter, we start by understanding the ratio of oil to peanuts. The ratio given is 2 ounces of oil for every 8 ounces of peanuts.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ ounces of oil} + 8 \\text{ ounces of peanuts} = 10 \\text{ parts}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know the total weight of the peanut butter batch is 20 ounces. We need to determine how many of these parts correspond to the total weight:\n\\[\n\\frac{20 \\text{ ounces}}{10 \\text{ parts}} = 2 \\text{ ounces per part}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the weight of the oil in the batch. Since the oil makes up 2 parts of the ratio, we multiply the weight per part by 2:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ parts} \\times 2 \\text{ ounces per part} = 4 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of ounces of oil Sonja used is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
