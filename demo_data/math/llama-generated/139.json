His bedroom took eight wooden planks, his living room took twenty planks, and his kitchen took eleven planks. The guest bedroom took two fewer planks than Andrew’s bedroom, and each of his two hallways took four planks. He accidentally ruined three planks in each bedroom by dragging furniture over them and had to replace them. He ended up with six leftover planks at the end.

Sum the total number of planks used.\n3. Add the number of planks replaced and the leftover planks to find the total number of planks bought.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of planks used in each room:\n\n- Bedroom: Andrew's bedroom took 8 planks. The guest bedroom took 2 fewer planks than Andrew's bedroom, so it took \\(8 - 2 = 6\\) planks.\n- Living room: The living room took 20 planks.\n- Kitchen: The kitchen took 11 planks.\n- Hallways: Each of the two hallways took 4 planks, so together they took \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) planks.\n\nNow, sum the total number of planks used:\n\n\\[\n8 \\text{ (bedroom)} + 6 \\text{ (guest bedroom)} + 20 \\text{ (living room)} + 11 \\text{ (kitchen)} + 8 \\text{ (hallways)} = 53 \\text{ planks}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the planks replaced. Andrew ruined 3 planks in each bedroom, and he has two bedrooms. So, he replaced \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) planks.\n\nAdding the replace planks and the leftover planks to the total number of planks used, we get:\n\n\\[\n53 + 6 + 6 = 65 \\text{ planks}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of wooden planks Andrew bought is \\(\\boxed{65}\\).",
