        "To determine Alexander's height on his 12th birthday, we start by noting his height on his 8th birthday and his growth rate per year.\n\n1. Alexander's height on his 8th birthday is 50 inches.\n2. He grows \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) foot per year. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) foot is equal to \\(12 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 6\\) inches per year.\n3. The number of years between his 8th birthday and his 12th birthday is \\(12 - 8 = 4\\) years.\n4. Therefore, the total growth over these 4 years is \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\) inches.\n5. Adding this growth to his height on his 8th birthday, we get \\(50 + 24 = 74\\) inches.\n\nSo, Alexander will be \\(\\boxed{74}\\) inches tall on his 12th birthday.",
