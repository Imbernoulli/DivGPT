        "To determine how many pounds of oats Billy needs to feed his horses for 3 days, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. Calculate the amount of oats each horse eats in one day.\n   - Each horse eats 4 pounds of oats twice a day.\n   - Therefore, each horse eats \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) pounds of oats in one day.\n\n2. Calculate the total amount of oats all four horses eat in one day.\n   - Since Billy has four horses, the total amount of oats they eat in one day is \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\) pounds.\n\n3. Calculate the total amount of oats all four horses eat in 3 days.\n   - Since they eat 32 pounds of oats in one day, the total amount of oats they eat in 3 days is \\(32 \\times 3 = 96\\) pounds.\n\nTherefore, Billy needs \\(\\boxed{96}\\) pounds of oats to feed his horses for 3 days.",
        "To determine the total amount of oats Billy needs to feed his horses for 3 days, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse. Each horse eats 4 pounds of oats, twice a day. Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ pounds/meal} \\times 2 \\text{ meals/day} = 8 \\text{ pounds/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out the total daily oats consumption for all four horses.
