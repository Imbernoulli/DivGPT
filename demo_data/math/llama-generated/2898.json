Calculate the distance he will cover in 4 hours at the new speed.\n\nFirst, we know the average speed for an hour drive is 66 miles per hour. If Felix wants to drive twice as fast, we multiply 66 miles per hour by 2:\n\\[ 66 \\times 2 = 132 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many miles Felix will cover in 4 hours at this new speed. We do this by multiplying the new speed by the number of hours he is driving:\n\\[ 132 \\times 4 = 528 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of miles Felix will cover is \\(\\boxed{528}\\)."
