        "To determine how many beignets Sandra will eat in 16 weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of beignets Sandra eats in one day.\n2. Calculate the number of beignets Sandra eats in one week.\n3. Calculate the number of beignets Sandra eats in 16 weeks.\n\nFirst, we know that Sandra eats 3 beignets every morning. Therefore, she eats:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ beignets/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many beignets she eats in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of beignets she eats each day by 7:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ beignets/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 21 \\text{ beignets/week} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many beignets she eats in 16 weeks. We multiply the number of beignets she eats each week by 16:\n\\[ 21 \\text{ beignets/week} \\times 16 \\text{ weeks} = 336 \\text{ beignets} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of beignets Sandra will eat in 16 weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{336} \\]"
