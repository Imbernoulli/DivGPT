        "To determine the total number of people who attended the party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of married women at the party.\n2. Determine the number of husbands who attended the party.\n3. Find the total number of men at the party.\n4. Calculate the number of single men at the party.\n5. Add the number of women, married men, and single men to get the total number of people at the party.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of married women at the party.\n   There are 60 women at the party, and three-fourths of them are married.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of married women} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 60 = 45\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the number of husbands who attended the party.\n   Since each married woman brought her husband, the number of husbands is equal to the number of married women.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of husbands} = 45\n   \\]\n\n3. Find the total number of men at the party.\n   We know that three-fourths of the men at the party were single. Let \\( M \\) be the total number of men at the party. Then, the number of single men is \\(\\frac{3}{4}M\\), and the number of married men is \\(\\frac{1}{4}M\\). We already know that the number of married men is 45, so we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4}M = 45\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( M \\):\n   \\[\n   M = 45 \\times 4 = 180\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the number of single men at the party.\n   Since three-fourths of the men were single:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of single men} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 180 = 135\n   \\]\n\n5. Add the number of women, married men, and single men to get the total number of people at the party.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of people} = \\text{Number of women} + \\text{Number of married men} + \\text{Number of single men} = 60 + 45 + 135 = 240\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who attended the party is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",
