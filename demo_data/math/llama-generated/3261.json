        "To determine how many cups of juice were drunk at the party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cups of juice Mr. Williams bought:**\n   - Mr. Williams bought 10 gallons of juice.\n   - Each gallon contains 10 cups.\n   - Therefore, the total number of cups is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\text{ gallons} \\times 10 \\text{ cups/gallon} = 100 \\text{ cups}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of cups of juice left after the party:**\n   - At the party, 5 cups of juice were left.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of cups of juice drunk:**\n   - To find out how many cups were drunk, we subtract the number of cups left from the total number of cups:\n     \\[\n     100 \\text{ cups} - 5 \\text{ cups} = 95 \\text{ cups}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of cups of juice drunk at the party is \\(\\boxed{95}\\).",
        "First, we need to determine the total amount of juice Mr. Williams bought. Since each gallon contains 10 cups and he bought 10 gallons, we can calculate the total number of cups as follows:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ gallons} \\times 10 \\text{ cups/gallon} = 100 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cups of juice were drunk. We know that after the party, 5 cups of juice were left. Therefore, the number of cups of juice that were drunk is the total number of cups minus the number of cups left:\n\n\\[ 100 \\text{ cups} - 5 \\text{ cups} = 95 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nSo, the number of cups of juice that were drunk is \\(\\boxed{95}\\).",
