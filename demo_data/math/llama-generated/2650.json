They begin to harvest it and carry it off to their anthill. Every hour, the ants remove 4 ounces of sugar. The bag of sugar held 24 ounces before it was dropped. After three hours, how many more hours will the ants need to harvest the remaining sugar?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many more hours the ants need to harvest the remaining sugar, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of sugar removed by the ants in the first three hours.\n2. Subtract the amount of sugar removed from the initial amount of sugar to find out how much sugar is left.\n3. Determine how many more hours are needed to remove the remaining sugar.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of sugar removed by the ants in the first three hours. Since the ants remove 4 ounces of sugar every hour, in three hours they will remove:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ ounces/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 12 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount of sugar removed from the initial amount of sugar to find out how much sugar is left. The initial amount of sugar was 24 ounces, so after three hours, the remaining amount of sugar is:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ ounces} - 12 \\text{ ounces} = 12 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many more hours are needed to remove the remaining 12 ounces of sugar. Since the ants remove 4 ounces of sugar every hour, the number of hours needed to remove the remaining 12 ounces is:\n\\[ \\frac{12 \\text{ ounces}}{4 \\text{ ounces/hour}} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the ants need \\(\\boxed{3}\\) more hours to harvest the remaining sugar.",
