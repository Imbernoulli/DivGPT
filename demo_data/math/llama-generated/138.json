        "To determine how many hours Reese will practice piano after five months, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many weeks are in five months.\n2. Calculate the total number of hoursè•¾ practices in those weeks.\n\nFirst, we need to know the average number of weeks in a month. Typically, a month is considered to have about 4 weeks. Therefore, five months would be:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ months} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 20 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Reese practices for 4 hours each week. So, to find out how many hours he will practice in 20 weeks, we multiply the number of weeks by the number of hours he practices each week:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ weeks} \\times 4 \\text{ hours/week} = 80 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Reese will practice after five months is:\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]",
