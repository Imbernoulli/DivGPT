So, we multiply the number of starfish by the number of arms per starfish:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ starfish} \\times 5 \\text{ arms per starfish} = 35 \\text{ arms} \\]\n\nNext, we consider the seastar. Carly collected 1 seastar, and it has 14 arms. So, we have:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ seastar} \\times 14 \\text{ arms per seastar} = 14 \\text{ arms} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of arms from the starfish and the seastar to get the total number of arms:\n\\[ 35 \\text{ arms} + 14 \\text{ arms} = 49 \\text{ arms} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of arms on the animals Carly collected is:\n\\[ \\boxed{49} \\]",
