He can assemble 1 widget every 10 minutes. Jack from the loading dock can help assemble widgets when he doesn't have anything else to do. When he helps, they put together 2 complete widgets every 15 minutes. Recently the factory hired Tony to help assemble widgets. Being new to the job, he doesn't work as fast as Sam or Jack. Yesterday Sam worked for 6 hours before he had to leave work early for a dentist appointment. Jack was able to help out for 4 hours before he had to go back to the loading dock to unload a new shipment of widget materials. Tony worked the entire 8-hour shift. At the end of the day, they had completed 68 widgets. How long does it take Tony to assemble a Widget, in minutes?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "First, we calculate the number of widgets Sam assembled. Sam works for 6 hours, and since he assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes, we convert 6 hours to minutes:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nNext, we determine how many widgets Samas assembled:\n\\[ 360 \\text{ minutes} \\div 10 \\text{ minutes/widget} = 36 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of widgets Sam and Jack assembled together. Jack helps for 4 hours, and together they assemble 2 widgets every 15 minutes. First, we convert 4 hours to minutes:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nNext, we determine how many widgets Sam and Jack assembled together:\n\\[ 240 \\text{ minutes} \\div 15 \\text{ minutes\r\n\nwidgets} = 16 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nThe total number of widgets assembled by Sam and Jack is:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ widgets} + 16 \\text{ widgets} = 52 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nSince the total number of widgets completed at the end of the day is 68, the number of widgets assembled by Tony is:\n\\[ 68 \\text{ widgets} - 52 \\text{ widgets} = 16 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nTony worked the entire 8-hour shift, which we convert to minutes:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nTo find out how long it takes Tony to assemble one widget, we divide the total time he worked by the number of widgets he assembled:\n\\[ 480 \\text{ minutes} \\div 16 \\text{ widgets} = 30 \\text{ minutes/widget} \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Tony \\(\\boxed{30}\\) minutes to assemble a widget.",
        "To determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, we need to calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony and then find Tony's work rate.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of widgets Sam assembled. Sam works for 6 hours, and he assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Sam works for:\n\\[ 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nThe number of widgets Sam assembles is:\n\\[ \\frac{360}{10} = 36 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of widgets Jack assembled. Jack works for 4 hours, and when he helps Sam, they together assemble 2 widgets every 15 minutes. Since they work together for the entire 4 hours, Jack works for:\n\\[ 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nThe number of widgets assembled by Sam and Jack together is:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{15} \\times 2 = 16 \\times 2 = 32 \\text{ widgets} \\]\nSince Jack helps Sam for the entire 240 minutes, he assembles half of these widgets alone. The number of widgets Jack assembles is:\n\\[ \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of widgets Tony assembled. Tony works the entire 8-hour shift, so he works for:\n\\[ 8 \\times 60 = 480 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nLet's denote the time it takes Tony to assemble one widget as \\( t \\) minutes. The number of widgets Tony assembles is:\n\\[ \\frac{480}{t} \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nThe total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony is given as 68. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 36 + 16 + \\frac{480}{t} = 68 \\]\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\\[ 52 + \\frac{480}{t} = 68 \\]\nSubtracting 52 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{480}{t} = 16 \\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\( t \\), we get:\n\\[ 480 = 16t \\]\nDividing both sides by 16, we get:\n\\[ t = 30 \\]\n\nSo, it takes Tony \\(\\boxed{30}\\) minutes to assemble a widget.",
        "To determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, we need to calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony and set it equal to 68.

        "To determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, we need to calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony individually and then use that information to find Tony's rate.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of widgets Sam assembled:\n- Sam works for 6 hours.\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Sam works \\(6 \\times 60 = 360\\) minutes.\n- Sam assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes, so the number of widgets he assembles is \\(360 \\div 10 = 36\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of widgets Jack assembled:\n- Jack works for 4 hours.\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Jack works \\(4 \\times 60 = 240\\) minutes.\n- Jack helps Sam and together they assemble 2 widgets every 15 minutes. The number of 15-minute intervals in 240 minutes is \\(240 \\div 15 = 16\\). Therefore, the number of widgets they assemble together is \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\).\n- Since Jack helps Sam, he assembles half of these widgets, so the number of widgets Jack assembles is \\(32 \\div 2 = 16\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of widgets Tony assembled:\n- Tony works for 8 hours.\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Tony works \\(8 \\times 60 = 480\\) minutes.\n- Let \\(r\\) be the rate at which Tony assembles widgets in widgets per minute. The number of widgets Tony assembles is \\(480r\\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony is 68. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[36 + 16 + 480r = 68\\]\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[52 + 480r = 68\\]\nSubtracting 52 from both sides, we get:\n\\[480r = 16\\]\nDividing both sides by 480, we get:\n\\[r = \\frac{16}{480} = \\frac{1}{30}\\]\nThis means Tony assembles widgets at a rate of \\(\\frac{1}{30}\\) widgets per minute. Therefore, it takes Tony 30 minutes to assemble one widget.\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
        "To determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many widgets Sam assembled. Sam works for 6 hours, and since he assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes, we can convert his working time into minutes:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nSince Sam assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes, the total number of widgets he assembled is:\n\\[ \\frac{360}{10} = 36 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many widgets Jack assembled. Jack works for 4 hours, and since he helps assemble widgets with Sam, they put together 2 widgets every 15 minutes. First, we convert Jack's working time into minutes:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nSince they work together for 240 minutes and they complete 2 widgets every 15 minutes, the total number of widgets they complete together is:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{15} \\times 2 = 16 \\times 2 = 32 \\text{ widgets} \\]\nSince Jack helps Sam, he assembles half of these widgets, so the number of widgets Jack assembled is:\n\\[ \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nNow, we know the total number of widgets assembled by Sam and Jack is:\n\\[ 36 + 16 = 52 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nSince the total number of widgets completed at the end of the day is 68, the number of widgets assembled by Tony is:\n\\[ 68 - 52 = 16 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nTony worked the entire 8-hour shift, which is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\times 60 = 480 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSince Tony assembled 16 widgets in 480 minutes, the time it takes Tony to assemble one widget is:\n\\[ \\frac{480}{16} = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the time it takes Tony to assemble a widget is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",
        "To determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, we need to calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony and then find out how many widgets Tony assembled. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of widgets Sam assembled:**\n   Sam works for 6 hours, which is \\(6 \\times 60 = 360\\) minutes. Since he assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes, the number of widgets Sam assembled is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{360}{10} = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of widgets Jack assembled:**\n   Jack works for 4 hours, which is \\(4 \\times 60 = 240\\) minutes. When Jack helps, they together assemble 2 widgets every 15 minutes. Therefore, their combined rate is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2 \\text{ widgets}}{15 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{2}{15} \\text{ widgets per minute}\n   \\]\n   Jack helps for 240 minutes, so together they assemble:\n   \\[\n   240 \\times \\frac{2}{15} = 32 \\text{ widgets}\n   \\]\n   Since Jack helps for the entire time he works, he assembles half of these widgets. Thus, the number of widgets Jack assembled is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{32}{2} = 16\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam and Jack:**\n   Adding the widgets assembled by Sam and Jack gives:\n   \\[\n   36 + 16 = 52\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of widgets assembled by Tony:**\n   The total number of widgets assembled by all three is 68. Therefore, the number of widgets assembled by Tony is:\n   \\[\n   68 - 52 = 16\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the time it takes Tony to assemble a widget:**\n   Tony worked for 8 hours, which is \\(8 \\times 60 = 480\\) minutes. Since he assembled 16 widgets, the time it takes Tony to assemble one widget is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{480}{16} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the time it takes Tony to assemble a widget is \\(\\boxed{30}\\) minutes.",
        "To determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, we need to calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony and then find Tony's individual contribution.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of widgets Sam assembled:\n- Sam works for 6 hours.\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Sam works for \\(6 \\times 60 = 360\\) minutes.\n- Sam assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes, so he assembles \\(360 \\div 10 = 36\\) widgets.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of widgets Jack assembled:\n- Jack works for 4 hours.\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Jack works for \\(4 \\times 60 = 240\\) minutes.\n- When Jack helps, they put together 2 widgets every 15 minutes. Therefore, together they assemble \\(240 \\div 15 = 16\\) sets of 2 widgets.\n- This means they assemble \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\) widgets together. Since Jack helps equally with Sam, he contributes half of these widgets.\n- Jack's contribution is \\(32 \\div 2 = 16\\) widgets.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam and Jack:\n- Sam asymptsembles 36 widgets.\n- Jack asymptsembles 16 widgets.\n- Together, they asymptaffer \\(36 + 16 = 52\\) widgets.\n\nWe know that the total number of widgets completed at the end of the day is 68. Therefore, the number of widgets assembled by Tony is:\n\\[ 68 - 52 = 16 \\]\n\nTony worked the entire 8-hour shift:\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Tony works for \\(8 \\times 60 = 480\\) minutes.\n\nTo find out how long it takes Tony to assemble one widget, we divide the total number of widgets he assembled by the total number of minutes he worked:\n\\[ \\frac{16}{480} = \\frac{1}{30} \\]\n\nSo, it takes Tony \\(\\boxed{30}\\) minutes to assemble a widget.",
        "To determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, we need to calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony separately and then use the total to find Tony's work rate.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of widgets Sam assembled. Sam works for 6 hours, which is \\(6 \\times 60 = 360\\) minutes. Since he assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes, the total number of widgets he assembled is:\n\\[\n\\frac{360}{10} = 36\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of widgets Jack assembled. Jack works for 4 hours, which is \\(4 \\times 60 = 240\\) minutes. When he helps, they put together 2 widgets every 15 minutes. This means that together they assemble:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{15} \\times 240 = 32 \\text{ widgets}\n\\]\nSince Jack helps for 240 minutes, he nails \\(32 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 16\\) widgets (because he helps half the time otherwise he would assemble 16 widgets on his own).\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of widgets Tony assembled. Tony works for the entire 8-hour shift, which is \\(8 \\times 60 = 480\\) minutes. Let's assume it takes Tony \\(x\\) minutes to assemble 1 widget.

        "To determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, we need to calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony and set it equal to 68.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of widgets Sam assembled. Sam works for 6 hours, and since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he works for:\n\\[ 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nSam assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes, so the total number of widgets he assembles is:\n\\[ \\frac{360}{10} = 36 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of widgets Jack assembled. Jack works for 4 hours, so he works for:\n\\[ 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nWhen Jack helps, they put together 2 complete widgets every 15 minutes. Since Jack helps for 240 minutes, the number of 15-minute intervals in 240 minutes is:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{15} = 16 \\]\nSo, the total number of widgets assembled when Jack helps is:\n\\[ 16 \\times 2 = 32 \\text{ widgets} \\]\nHowever, Jack is only helping Sam, so heassembles half of these widgets alone:\n\\[ \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of widgets Tony assembled. Tony worked the entire 8-hour shift, so he works for:\n\\[ 8 \\times 60 = 480 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nLet \\( t \\) be the time it takes Tony to assemble one widget. Therefore, the total number of widgets Tony assembles is:\n\\[ \\frac{480}{t} \\]\n\nThe total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony is the sum of the widgets each of them assembled:\n\\[ 36 + 16 + \\frac{480}{t} = 68 \\]\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\\[ 52 + \\frac{480}{t} = 68 \\]\nSubtracting 52 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{480}{t} = 16 \\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\( t \\), we get:\n\\[ 480 = 16t \\]\nDividing both sides by 16, we get:\n\\[ t = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Tony \\(\\boxed{30}\\) minutes to assemble a widget.",

        "To determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, we need to calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony individually and then use the information given about the total number of widgets completed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of widgets Sam assembled. Sam works for 6 hours, and since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he works for:\n\\[ 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nSince Sam can assemble 1 widget every 10 minutes, the number of widgets he assembles is:\n\\[ \\frac{360}{10} = 36 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of widgets Jack assembled. Jack works for 4 hours, which is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nWhen Jack helps Sam, they work together for 15 minutes and complete 2 widgets. Therefore, in 240 minutes, the number of 15-minute intervals is:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{15} = 16 \\text{ intervals} \\]\nSince they complete 2 widgets per interval, the number of widgets completed together is:\n\\[ 16 \\times 2 = 32 \\text{ widgets} \\]\nSince Jack helps Sam, he contributes half of these widgets (because they work together and each contributes equally):\n\\[ \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of widgets Tony assembled. Tony works for 8 hours, which is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 60 = 480 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nLet \\( t \\) be the time it takes Tony to assemble one widget in minutes. The number of widgets Tony assembles is:\n\\[ \\frac{480}{t} \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony is 68. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 36 + 16 + \\frac{480}{t} = 68 \\]\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 52 + \\frac{480}{t} = 68 \\]\nSubtracting 52 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{480}{t} = 16 \\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\( t \\), we get:\n\\[ 480 = 16t \\]\nDividing both sides by 16, we get:\n\\[ t = 30 \\]\n\nSo, it takes Tony \\(\\boxed{30}\\) minutes to assemble a widget.",
        "To determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, we need to calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony and then find Tony's work rate.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of widgets Sam assembled:\n- Sam works for 6 hours.\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n- Sam assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Widgets assembled by Sam} = 6 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} \\div 10 \\text{ minutes/widget} = 6 \\times 60 \\div 10 = 36 \\text{ widgets}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of widgets Jack assembled:\n- Jack works for 4 hours.\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n- Jack helps assemble 2 widgets every 15 minutes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Widgets assembled by Jack} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} \\div 15 \\text{ minutes iy} \\times 2 \\text{ widgets} = 4 \\times 60 \\div 15 \\times 2 = 16 \\text{ widgets}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of widgets assembled by Sam and Jack:\n\\[\n\\text{Total widgets by Sam and Jack} = 36 \\text{ widgets} + 16 \\text{ widgets} = 52 \\text{ widgets}\n\\]\n\nWe know the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony is 68. Therefore, the number of widgets assembled by Tony is:\n\\[\n\\text{Widgets assembled by Tony} = 68 \\text{ widgets} - 52 \\text{ widgets} = 16 \\text{ widgets}\n\\]\n\nTony worked for 8 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour:\n\\[\n\\text{Total minutes Tony worked} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTo find the time it takes Tony to assemble one widget, we divide the total minutes he worked by the number of widgets he assembled:\n\\[\n\\text{Time per widget} = 480 \\text{ minutes} \\div 16 \\text{ widgets} = 30 \\text{ minutes/widget}\n\\]\n\nThus, it takes Tony \\boxed{30} minutes to assemble a widget.",

        "To determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, we need to calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony separately and then use the total number of widgets assembled to find Tony's rate.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of widgets Sam assembled. Sam works for 6 hours, and since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he works for:\n\\[ 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nSince Sam assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes, the number of widgets he assembles is:\n\\[ \\frac{360}{10} = 36 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of widgets Jack assembled. Jack works for 4 hours, so he works for:\n\\[ 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nWhen Jack helps Sam, they work together for 240 minutes and complete 2 widgets every 15 minutes. The number of 15-minute intervals in 240 minutes is:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{15} = 16 \\]\nSince they complete 2 widgets in each 15-minute interval, the total number of widgets they complete together is:\n\\[ 16 \\times 2 = 32 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n out of these 32 widgets, Jack completes half of them (since he helps Sam), so the number of widgets Jack assembles is:\n\\[ \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\text{ widgets} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of widgets Tony assembled. Tony works for the entire 8-hour shift, so he works for:\n\\[ 8 \\times 60 = 480 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nLet \\( x \\) be the time it takes Tony to assemble one widget. Then the number of widgets Tony assembles is:\n\\[ \\frac{480}{x} \\]\n\nThe total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony is the sum of the widgets each of them assembled:\n\\[ 36 + 16 + \\frac{480}{x} = 68 \\]\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 52 + \\frac{480}{x} = 68 \\]\nSubtracting 52 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{480}{x} = 16 \\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[ 480 = 16x \\]\nDividing both sides by 16, we get:\n\\[ x = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Tony \\(\\boxed{30}\\) minutes to assemble a widget.",
        "First, we calculate the number of widgets Sam assembled. Sam works for 6 hours, which is equivalent to \\(6 \\times 60 = 360\\) minutes. Since Sam assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes, the number of widgets he assembled is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{360}{10} = 36\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of widgets Jack assembled. Jack works for 4 hours, which is equivalent to \\(4 \\times 60 = 240\\) minutes. When Jack helps Sam, they work together and assemble 2 widgets every 15 minutes, which means they assemble \\(\\frac{240}{15} \\times 2 = 16 \\times 2 = 32\\) widgets in total. Since Jack helps Sam for the whole time he works, the number of widgets Jack assembled is the same as the total number of widgets they assembled together:\n\n\\[\n16\n\\]\n\nNow, we know the total number of widgets assembled by Sam and Jack is:\n\n\\[\n36 + 16 = 52\n\\]\n\nSince the total number of widgets completed at the end of the day is 68, the number of widgets assembled by Tony is:\n\n\\[\n68 - 52 = 16\n\\]\n\nTony worked the entire 8-hour shift, which is equivalent to \\(8 \\times 60 = 480\\) minutes. Let \\(x\\) be the time it takes Tony to assemble one widget. Since he assembled 16 widgets, we have:\n\n\\[\n16x = 480\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{480}{16} = 30\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Tony \\(\\boxed{30}\\) minutes to assemble a widget.",
        "To determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, we need to calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony and then find Tony's work rate.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of widgets Sam assembled:\n- Sam works for 6 hours.\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n- Sam assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total widgets by Sam} = 6 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} \\div 10 \\text{ minutes/widget} = 6 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 36 \\text{ widgets}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of widgets Jack assembled:\n- Jack worked for 4 hours.\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n- Jack helps assemble 2 widgets every 15 minutes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total widgets by Jack} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} \\div 15 \\text{ minutes眼科DAC} \\times 2 \\text{ widgets/15 minutes} = 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\text{ widgets}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam and Jack together:\n\\[\n\\text{Total widgets by Sam and Jack} = 36 \\text{ widgets} + 16 \\text{ widgets} = 52 \\text{ widgets}\n\\]\n\nWe know the total number of widgets assembled by all three is 68. Therefore, the number of widgets assembled by Tony is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total widgets by Tony} = 68 \\text{ widgets} - 52 \\text{ widgets} = 16 \\text{ widgets}\n\\]\n\nTony worked the entire 8-hour shift. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\\[\n\\text{Total minutes by Tony} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTo find the time it takes Tony to assemble one widget, we divide the total minutes by the number of widgets he assembled:\n\\[\n\\text{Time per widget by Tony} = \\frac{480 \\text{ minutes}}{16 \\text{ widgets}} = 30 \\text{ minutes/widget}\n\\]\n\nThus, it takes Tony \\(\\boxed{30}\\) minutes to assemble a widget.",
        "To determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, we need to calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony and then solve for Tony's azimuth time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of widgets Sam assembled. Sam works for 6 hours, and since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he works for \\(6 \\times 60 = 360\\) minutes.

Jack works for 4 hours, which is \\(4 \\times 60 = 240\\) minutes. When Jack helps Sam, they work together and complete 2 widgets every 15 minutes. Therefore, their combined rate is \\(\\frac{2}{15}\\) widgets per minute. Since Jack helps for 240 minutes, the number of widgets they complete together is \\(240 \\times \\frac{2}{15} = 32\\) widgets.

Tony works the entire 8-hour shift, which is \\(8 \\times 60 = 480\\) minutes. Let \\(x\\) be the time it takes Tony to assemble one widget. Therefore, the number of widgets Tony asympted is \\(\\frac{480}{x}\\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony is 68. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[36 + 32 + \\frac{480}{x} = 68\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[68 + \\frac{480}{x} = 68\\]\n\\[16 = \\frac{480}{x}\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \\(x\\):\n\\[16x = 480\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{480}{16} = 30\\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Tony \\(\\boxed{30}\\) minutes to assemble a widget.",
