        "To determine how many chocolate bars a 2 kilogram box of chocolate represents, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the weight of the box from kilograms to grams.\n2. Divide the total weight of the box by the weight of one chocolate bar.\n\nFirst, we convert 2 kilograms to grams. Since 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams, we have:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ kg} = 2 \\times 1000 \\text{ g} = 2000 \\text{ g} \\]\n\nNext, we divide the total weight of the box by the weight of one chocolate bar. The weight of one chocolate bar is 125 grams, so we calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{2000 \\text{ g}}{125 \\text{ g/bar}} = 16 \\text{ bars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the 2 kilogram box of chocolate represents \\(\\boxed{16}\\) chocolate bars.",
