        "To determine how many weeks it will take Camila to hike as many times as Steven, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of hikes Amanda has gone on.\n2. Calculate the number of hikes Steven has gone on.\n3. Determine how many more hikes Camila needs to match Steven's total.\n4. Calculate the number of weeks it will take Camila to complete the additional hikes.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of hikes Amanda has gone on. Amanda has gone on 8 times as many hikes as Camila. Since Camila has gone on 7 hikes, we have:\n\\[\n8 \\times 7 = 56\n\\]\nSo, Amanda has gone on 56 hikes.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of hikes Steven has gone on. Steven has gone on 15 more hikes than Amanda. Since Amanda has gone on 56 hikes, we have:\n\\[\n56 + 15 = 71\n\\]\nSo, Steven has gone on 71 hikes.\n\nNow, we determine how many more hikes Camila needs to match Steven's total. Since Camila has gone on 7 hikes and Steven has gone on 71 hikes, we need to find the difference:\n\\[\n71 - 7 = 64\n\\]\nSo, Camila needs to go on 64 more hikes.\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of weeks it will take Camila to complete the additional hikes. Since Camila plans to go on 4 hikes a week, we divide the number of additional hikes by the number of hikes she does per week:\n\\[\n64 \\div 4 = 16\n\\]\nSo, it will take Camila 16 weeks to achieve her goal.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]",

Since Camila has gone on 7 hikes, we multiply 7 by 8:\n\\[ 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\]\nSo, Amanda has gone on 56 hikes.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of hikes Steven has gone on.**\n\nSteven has gone on 15 more hikes than Amanda. Since Amanda has gone on 56 hikes, we add 15 to 56:\n\\[ 56 + 15 = 71 \\]\nSo, Steven has gone on 71 hikes.\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many more hikes Camila needs to match Steven's total.**\n\n Camila has gone on 7 hikes and needs to go on 71 hikes to match Steven. We subtract the number of hikes Camila has gone on from the number of hikes Steven has gone on:\n\\[ 71 - 7 = 64 \\]\nSo, Camila needs to go on 64 more hikes.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of weeks Camila needs to complete the additional hikes.**\n\nCamila plans to go on 4 hikes a week. To find out how many weeks it will take her to go on 64 more hikes, we divide 64 by 4:\n\\[ 64 \\div 4 = 16 \\]\nSo, it will take Camila 16 weeks to achieve her goal.\n\nTherefore, the number of weeks it will take Camila to achieve her goal is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",

        "To determine how many weeks it will take Camila to hike as many times as Steven, we first need to find out how many times Amanda and Steven have gone hiking.\n\n1. Calculate the number of hikes Amanda has gone on:\n   Amanda has gone on 8 times as many hikes as Camila. Since Camila has gone on 7 hikes, we have:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 7 = 56\n   \\]\n   So, Amanda has gone on 56 hikes.\n\n2. Calculate the number of hikes Steven has gone on:\n   Steven has gone on 15 more hikes than Amanda. Since Amanda has gone on 56 hikes, we have:\n   \\[\n   56 + 15 = 71\n   \\]\n   So, Steven has gone on 71 hikes.\n\n3. Determine how many more hikes Camila needs to go on to match Steven:\n   Camila has gone on 7 hikes, and she needs to go on 71 hikes to match Steven. The difference in the number of hikes is:\n   \\[\n   71 - 7 = 64\n   \\]\n   So, Camila needs to go on 64 more hikes.\n\n4. Calculate the number of weeks it will take Camila to go on 64 more hikes if she goes on 4 hikes a week:\n   Since Camila goes on 4 hikes each week, the number of weeks required is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{64}{4} = 16\n   \\]\n   So, it will take Camila 16 weeks to achieve her goal.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many weeks it will take Camila to hike as many times as Steven, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of hikes Amanda has gone on.\n2. Calculate the number of hikes Steven has gone on.\n3. Determine how many more hikes Camila needs to match Steven's total.\n4. Calculate the number of weeks Camila will need to hike to achieve her goal.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many hikes Amanda has gone on. Since Amanda has gone on 8 times as many hikes as Camila, we multiply Camila's total by 8:\n\\[\n8 \\times 7 = 56\n\\]\nSo, Amanda has gone on 56 hikes.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of hikes Steven has gone on. Since Steven has gone on 15 more hikes than Amanda, we add 15 to Amanda's total:\n\\[\n56 + 15 = 71\n\\]\nSo, Steven has gone on 71 hikes.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many more hikes Camila needs to match Steven's total. We subtract Camila's total from Steven's total:\n\\[\n71 - 7 = 64\n\\]\nSo, Camila needs to hike 64 more times.\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of weeks Camila will need to hike to achieve her goal. Since Camila plans to go on 4 hikes a week, we divide the number of additional hikes she needs by the number of hikes she does per week:\n\\[\n64 \\div 4 = 16\n\\]\nSo, it will take Camila \\boxed{16} weeks to achieve her goal.",
