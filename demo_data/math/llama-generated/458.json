        "To determine how many worms 5 crows will eat in 2 hours, we start by finding out how many worms one crow eats in one hour. We know that 3 crows eat 30 worms in one hour. Therefore, we can calculate the number of worms one crow eats in one hour by dividing 30 by 3:\n\n\\[ \\text{Worms eaten by one crow in one hour} = \\frac{30}{3} = 10 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many worms 5 crows will eat in one hour. Since one crow eats 10 worms in one hour, 5 crows will eat:\n\n\\[ \\text{Worms eaten by 5 crows in one hour} = 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\]\n\nFinally, we need to determine how many worms 5 crows will eat in 2 hours. Since 5 crows eat 50 worms in one hour, in 2 hours they will eat:\n\n\\[ \\text{Worms eaten by 5 crows in 2 hours} = 50 \\times 2 = 100 \\]\n\nThus, the number of worms that 5 crows will eat in 2 hours is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",

Since 5 crows eat 50 worms in one hour, in 2 hours they will eat:\n\\[\n\\text{Worms in 2 hours for 5 crows} = 50 \\times 2 = 100\n\\]\nSo, 5 crows will eat \\boxed{100} worms in 2 hours.",
