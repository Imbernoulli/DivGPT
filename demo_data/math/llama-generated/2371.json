        "To determine how much Jon makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of visits per hour:**\n   Jon gets 50 visits each hour.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of visits per day:**\n   Since the website operates 24 hours a day, we multiply the number of visits per hour by the number of hours in a day:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ visits/hour} \\times 24 \\text{ hours/day} = 1200 \\text{ visits/day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of visits in a 30-day month:**\n   To find the total number of visits in a 30-day month, we multiply the number of visits per day by the number of days in the month:\n   \\[\n   1200 \\text{ visits/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 36000 \\text{ visits}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Jon's total earnings:**\n   Jon gets paid $0.10 for each visit.

Calculate the number of visits Jon gets in one day.\n3. Calculate the number of visits Jon gets in one month.\n4. Calculate Jon's total earnings for the month.\n\nFirst, we know that Jon gets 50 visits per hour. Since his website operates 24 hours a day, the number of visits he gets in one day is:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ visits/hour} \\times 24 \\text{ hours/day} = 1200 \\text{ visits/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many visits Jon gets in a 30-day month.
