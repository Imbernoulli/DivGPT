The games console costs $282, and Woody already has $42. Therefore, the remaining amount is:\n\\[ 282 - 42 = 240 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Woody receives an allowance of $24 every week. To find out how many weeks it will take him to save the remaining $240, we divide the remaining amount by his weekly allowance:\n\\[ 240 \\div 24 = 10 \\]\n\nSo, it will take Woody \\(\\boxed{10}\\) weeks to save the money he needs for the game console.",
