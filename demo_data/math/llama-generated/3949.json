Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount.\n\nFirst, let's find the total cost of the living room set before the discount. The cost of the coach is $2500, the cost of the sectional is $3500, and the combined cost of everything else is $2000. Adding these amounts together gives:\n\\[ 2500 + 3500 + 2000 = 8000 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the discount amount. Since the discount is 10%, we multiply the total cost before the discount by 10% (or 0.10):\n\\[ 8000 \\times 0.10 = 800 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount to find out how much James paid:\n\\[ 8000 - 800 = 7200 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount James paid is \\(\\boxed{7200}\\).",
