        "To determine how many girls were not able to join the field trip, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of students assigned to the minibus.\n   - There are 18 students in total.\n\n2. Identify the number of boys assigned to the minibus.\n   - There are 8 boys.\n\n3. Calculate the number of girls assigned to the minibus.\n   - Since the total number of students is 18 and there are 8 boys, the number of girls is \\(18 - 8 = 10\\).\n\n4. Determine the number of students who actually attended the field trip.\n   - On the day of the field trip, the number of girls and boys was the same. Let \\(x\\) be the number of boys who attended the field trip. Since the number of girls who attended the field trip is also \\(x\\), the total number of students who attended the field trip is \\(x + x = 2x\\).\n\n5. Since the number of boys who attended the field trip is the same as the number of boys assigned to the minibus, \\(x = 8\\). Therefore, the total number of students who attended the field trip is \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\).\n\n6. Determine how many girls did not attend the field trip.\n   - Since 10 girls were assigned to the minibus and only 8 girls attended the field trip (because \\(16 - 8 = 8\\) and all boys attended), the number of girls who did not attend the field trip is \\(10 - 8 = 2\\).\n\nThus, the number of girls who were not able to join the field trip is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

Determine the number of boys and girls on the day of the field trip.\n   - On the day of the field trip, the number of boys and girls was the same.\n   - The number of boys did not change, so it is still 8.\n   - Let \\(g\\) be the number of girls who joined the trip. According to the problem, the number of boys and girls on the trip is the same, so \\(g = 8\\).\n\n3.

We know that there were 18 students in total and 8 of them were boys. Therefore, the number of girls is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ 18 - 8 = 10 \\]\n\nSo, initially, there were 10 girls in the minibus. On the day of the field trip, the number of girls and boys was the same. Since the number of boys remained 8, the number of girls who joined the trip must also be 8. Let's denote the number of girls who did not join the trip as \\( x \\). The number of girls who joined the trip is then \\( 10 - x \\). According to the problem, this number is equal to the number of boys, which is 8. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 10 - x = 8 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation by subtracting 8 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 10 - 8 = x \\]\n\\[ x = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the number of girls who were not able to join the field trip is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

        "To determine how many girls were not able to join the field trip, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of students and the number of boys.\n2.

Find out how many girls were not able to join the trip.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- Total number of students: 18\n- Number of boys: 8\n\nFirst, calculate the initial number of girls:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} = \\text{Total number of students} - \\text{Number of boys} = 18 - 8 = 10\n\\]\n\nOn the day of the field trip, the number of girls and boys was the same. Since there were 8 boys, the number of girls who joined the trip must also be 8.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many girls were not able to join the trip. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of girls who joined the trip from the initial number of girls:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls not able to join} = \\text{Initial number of girls} - \\text{Number of girls who joined} = 10 - 8 = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of girls who were not able to join the field trip is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
