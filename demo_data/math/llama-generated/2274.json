        "To determine the cost of the Legos set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money George earned from selling the little cars.\n2. Subtract the amount earned from selling the little cars from the total amount earned to find the cost of the Legos set.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of money George earned from selling the little cars. Since he sold 3 little cars and each little car was sold for $5, we multiply the number of little cars by the price per little car:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ little cars} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars per little car} = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount earned from selling the little cars from the total amount earned to find the cost of the Legos set:\n\\[ 45 \\text{ dollars} - 15 \\text{ dollars} = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the Legos set is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
