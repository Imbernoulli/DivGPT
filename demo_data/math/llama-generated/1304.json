        "To determine how much money Sophie saves in a year not buying dryer sheets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of dryer sheets Sophie uses in a year.\n2. Determine the cost of the dryer sheets she uses in a year.\n3. Find out how much money she saves by not buying dryer sheets.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of dryer sheets Sophie uses in a year.**\n\nSophie does 4 loads of laundry a week and uses 1 dryer sheet per load. Therefore, the number of dryer sheets she uses in a week is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ loads/week} \\times 1 \\text{ dryer sheet/load} = 4 \\text{ dryer sheets/week} \\]\n\nSince there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of dryer sheets she uses in a year is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ dryer sheets/week} \\times 52 \\text{ weeks/year} = 208 \\text{ dryer sheets/year} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost of the dryer sheets she uses in a year.**\n\nA box of dryer sheets costs $5.50 and has 104 dryer sheets in a box. To find out how many boxes of dryer sheets Sophie needs in a year, we divide the total number of dryer sheets she uses by the number of dryer sheets in a box:\n\\[ \\frac{208 \\text{ dryer sheets/year}}{104 \\text{ dryer sheets/box}} = 2 \\text{ boxes/year} \\]\n\nThe cost of 2 boxes of dryer sheets is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ boxes/year} \\times \\$5.50 \\text{ per box} = \\$11.00 \\text{ per year} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out how much money she saves by not buying dryer sheets.**\n\nSince Sophie was given wool dryer balls to use instead of dryer sheets, she saves the entire cost of the dryer sheets she uses in a year. Therefore, the amount of money she saves in a year is:\n\\[ \\$11.00 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]",

Determine the cost of the dryer sheets she uses in a year.\n3. Calculate the savings by not buying dryer sheets.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of dryer sheets Sophie uses in a year. Since she does 4 loads of laundry each week and uses 1 dryer sheet per load, the number of dryer sheets she uses in a week is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ loads/week} \\times 1 \\text{ dryer sheet/load} = 4 \\text{ dryer sheets/week} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many dryer sheets she uses in a year.

Since each box contains 104 dryer sheets and costs $5.50, the number of boxes she needs is:\n\\[ \\frac{208 \\text{ dryer sheets}}{104 \\text{ dryer sheets/box}} = 2 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nThe cost for 2 boxes of dryer sheets is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ boxes} \\times \\$5.50/\\text{box} = \\$11.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Sophie saves in a year by not buying dryer sheets is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]",
