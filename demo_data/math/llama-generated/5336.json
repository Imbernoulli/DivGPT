The problem states that the council pays for adding twice as many trash cans to the back of stores as it does to the streets. Therefore, we calculate the number of trash cans added to the back of stores as follows:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 14 = 28\n   \\]\n3. Add the number of trash cans added to the streets and the number of trash cans added to the back of stores to find the total number of trash cans paid for by the town:\n   \\[\n   14 + 28 = 42\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of trash cans the town has paid for is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of trash cans the town has paid for, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.\n\n1. Identify the number of trash cans added to the streets. According to the problem, the council pays for adding 14 trash cans to the streets.\n2.
