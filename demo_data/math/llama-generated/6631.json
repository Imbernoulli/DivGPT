        "Let's start by determining how many tickets Nathaniel gives away. Initially, Nathaniel has 11 tickets and he ends up with 3 tickets. Therefore, the number of tickets he gives away is:\n\n\\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many best friends Nathaniel has. Since he gives away 2 tickets to each best friend, we can divide the total number of tickets given away by 2:\n\n\\[ 8 \\div 2 = 4 \\]\n\nSo, Nathaniel has \\(\\boxed{4}\\) best friends.",
