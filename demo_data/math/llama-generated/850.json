        "To find the percentage difference in the tail size of Eastern and Western rattlesnakes expressed as a percentage of the Western rattlesnake's tail size, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of tail segments for each type of rattlesnake:\n   - Eastern rattlesnake: 6 segments\n   - Western rattlesnake: 8 segments\n\n2. Calculate the difference in the number of tail segments between the two types of rattlesnakes:\n   \\[\n   8 - 6 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, the Eastern rattlesnake has 2 fewer tail segments than the Western rattlesnake.\n\n3. Express this difference as a percentage of the Western rattlesnake's tail size. We do this by dividing the difference by the number of tail segments of the Western rattlesnake and then multiplying by 100:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{2}{8} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.25 \\times 100 = 25\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage difference in their tail size, expressed as a percentage of the Western rattlesnake's tail size, is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",

Eastern rattlesnakes have 6 segments, and Western rattlesnakes have 8 segments.\n\nThe difference in the number of segments is:\n\\[ 8 - 6 = 2 \\]\n\nNext, we need to express this difference as a percentage of the Western rattlesnake's tail size. The Western rattlesnake's tail size is 8 segments, so we use the formula for percentage difference:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Difference} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Difference}}{\\text{oka redistribution\")\r\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Difference} = \\left( \\frac{2}{8} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction \\(\\frac{2}{8}\\):\n\\[ \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nThen, we multiply by 100 to convert the fraction to a percentage:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25 \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage difference in their tail size, expressed as a percentage of the Western rattlesnake's tail size, is:\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]",
