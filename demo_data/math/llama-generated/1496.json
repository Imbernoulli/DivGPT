        "To determine how many meters Lisa will walk in two days, we can break the problem down into smaller steps.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many meters Lisa walks in one day. We know that she walks 10 meters each minute and she walks for an hour each day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the distance she walks in one day as follows:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ meters/minute} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = 600 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many meters she walks in two days. Since she walks 600 meters each day, we can calculate the distance she walks in two days by multiplying the distance she walks in one day by 2:\n\n\\[ 600 \\text{ meters/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 1200 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance Lisa will walk in two days is \\(\\boxed{1200}\\) meters.",
