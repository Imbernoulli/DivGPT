        "To determine the price at which Vanessa sold each dress, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.\n\nLet \\( d \\) be the price of each dress in dollars. According to the problem, Vanessa sold 7 dresses and 4 shirts for a total of $69. We know that each shirt was sold for $5. Therefore, the total revenue from selling the shirts is \\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\) dollars.\n\nThe total revenue from selling the dresses is \\( 7d \\) dollars. The sum of the revenue from the dresses and the shirts is equal to the total amount of money made, which is $69. We can write this as the following equation:\n\\[ 7d + 20 = 69 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve for \\( d \\). First, we isolate the term with \\( d \\) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 7d = 69 - 20 \\]\n\\[ 7d = 49 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( d \\) by dividing both sides by 7:\n\\[ d = \\frac{49}{7} \\]\n\\[ d = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, the price at which each dress was sold is \\(\\boxed{7}\\) dollars.",

        "To determine the price at which Vanessa sold each dress, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.\n\nLet \\( d \\) be the price of each dress in dollars. According to the problem, Vanessa sold 7 dresses and 4 shirts for a total of $69. We also know that each shirt was sold for $5. Therefore, the total revenue from the shirts is \\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\) dollars.\n\nThe total revenue from the dresses is \\( 7d \\) dollars. The sum of the revenue from the dresses and the shirts is equal to the total amount of money made, which is $69. This gives us the following equation:\n\\[\n7d + 20 = 69\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( d \\) by isolating the variable. First, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n7d = 69 - 20\n\\]\n\\[\n7d = 49\n\\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 7:\n\\[\nd = \\frac{49}{7}\n\\]\n\\[\nd = 7\n\\]\n\nThus, the price at which each dress was sold is \\(\\boxed{7}\\) dollars.",

        "To determine the price at which Vanessa sold each dress, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the price of each dress by \\( d \\) dollars and the price of each shirt by \\( s \\) dollars. According to the problem, Vanessa sold 7 dresses and 4 shirts for a total of $69. We are also given that each shirt was sold for $5. Therefore, we can substitute \\( s = 5 \\) into the equation.\n\nThe equation representing the total sales is:\n\\[ 7d + 4s = 69 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( s = 5 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 7d + 4(5) = 69 \\]\n\\[ 7d + 20 = 69 \\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate \\( d \\). We do this by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 7d = 69 - 20 \\]\n\\[ 7d = 49 \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( d \\) by dividing both sides by 7:\n\\[ d = \\frac{49}{7} \\]\n\\[ d = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, the price at which Vanessa sold each dress is \\(\\boxed{7}\\) dollars."
