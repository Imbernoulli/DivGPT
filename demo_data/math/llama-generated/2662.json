Determine the number of pennies added to the piggy bank.\n3. Add the initial number of pennies to the number of pennies added.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial number of pennies. There are two pennies in each of the twelve compartments. Therefore, the initial number of pennies is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, let's determine the number of pennies added. Roshesmina adds 6 more pennies to each compartment. Since there are twelve compartments, the total number of pennies added is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 12 = 72 \\]\n\nNow, we add the initial number of pennies to the number of pennies added:\n\\[ 24 + 72 = 96 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pennies Roshesmina has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of pennies Roshesmina has in her piggy bank after adding more pennies, we can break the problem down into a series of smaller steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the initial number of pennies:**\n   - There are 12 compartments.\n   - Each compartment contains 2 pennies.\n   - Therefore, the initial total number of pennies is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\times 2 = 24\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of pennies added:**\n   - Roshesmina adds 6 more pennies to each compartment.\n   - There are 12 compartments.\n   - Therefore, the total number of pennies added is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\times 6 = 72\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of pennies after the addition:**\n   - The initial number of pennies is 24.\n   - The number of pennies added is 72.\n   - Therefore, the total number of pennies is:\n     \\[\n     24 + 72 = 96\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pennies Roshesmina has is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
