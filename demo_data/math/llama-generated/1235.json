        "To determine the total number of spokes on the bicycle, we start by identifying the number of spokes on each wheel. According to the problem, the front wheel has 20 spokes. The back wheel has twice as many spokes as the front wheel. Therefore, we calculate the number of spokes on the back wheel as follows:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 20 = 40\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the number of spokes on the front wheel to the number of spokes on the back wheel to find the total number of spokes on the bicycle:\n\n\\[\n20 + 40 = 60\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of spokes on the bicycle is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
