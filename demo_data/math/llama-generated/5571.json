According to the problem, the first bowl has a capacity equal to \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) the capacity of the second bowl. The second bowl has 600 marbles, so we can find the capacity of the first bowl by multiplying 600 by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Capacity of the first bowl} = 600 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 600 \\times 0.75 = 450\n\\]\n\nNow that we know the first bowl has 450 marbles and the second bowl has 600 marbles, we can find the total number of marbles in both bowls by adding the number of marbles in each bowl together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of marbles} = 450 + 600 = 1050\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of marbles both bowls are holding together is \\(\\boxed{1050}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of marbles held by both bowls, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the capacity of the first bowl relative to the second bowl.\n2. Calculate the number of marbles in the first bowl.\n3. Add the number of marbles in the first bowl to the number of marbles in the second bowl.\n\nGiven that the first bowl has a capacity equal to \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) the capacity of the second bowl and the second bowl has 600 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles in the first bowl as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of marbles in the first bowl} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 600\n\\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 600 = \\frac{3 \\times 600}{4} = \\frac{1800}{4} = 450\n\\]\n\nSo, the first bowl has 450 marbles. Now, we add the number of marbles in the first bowl to the number of marbles in the second bowl to find the total number of marbles:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of marbles} = 450 + 600 = 1050\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of marbles both bowls are holding together is \\(\\boxed{1050}\\).",
