        "To determine how many games the basketball team can lose to still win 60% of their games, we start by calculating the number of games they have won so far and the total number of games they will play.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of games won so far:\n\\[ 70\\% \\text{ of } 40 = 0.70 \\times 40 = 28 \\]\n\nNext, we determine the total number of games they will play after the remaining 10 games:\n\\[ 40 + 10 = 50 \\]\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of games they lose in the remaining 10 games. Then, the number of games they win in the remaining games is \\( 10 - x \\). The total number of games they win after the remaining games is:\n\\[ 28 + (10 - x) = 38 - x \\]\n\nWe want this total number of wins to be at least 60% of the total number of games played. Therefore, we set up the following inequality:\n\\[ 38 - x \\geq 0.60 \\times 50 \\]\n\\[ 38 - x \\geq 30 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 30 from both sides of the inequality:\n\\[ 38 - 30 \\geq x \\]\n\\[ 8 \\geq x \\]\n\\[ x \\leq 8 \\]\n\nThis means the team can lose up to 8 games in the remaining 10 games to still win at least 60% of their games. Therefore, the maximum number of games they can lose is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",

The team has 10 games left to play, so the total number of games will be:\n\\[\n40 + 10 = 50\n\\]\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of games the team loses out of the remaining 10 games. Then, the team will win \\( 10 - x \\) games. The total number of games won by the team after all games are played will be:\n\\[\n28 + (10 - x) = 38 - x\n\\]\n\nTo win 60% of their games, the team needs to have won at least 60% of the total 50 games. So, we set up the following inequality:\n\\[\n\\frac{38 - x}{50} \\geq 0.60\n\\]\n\nSolve the inequality for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n38 - x \\geq 0.60 \\times 50\n\\]\n\\[\n38 - x \\geq 30\n\\]\n\\[\n38 - 30 \\geq x\n\\]\n\\[\nx \\leq 8\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the team can lose up to 8 games to win at least 60% of their games.

Set up an equation to find out how many games the team can lose to win 60% of their games.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of games the team has already won:\n\\[ \\text{Games won so far} = 70\\% \\text{ of } 40 = 0.70 \\times 40 = 28. \\]\n\nNext, we determine the total number of games the team will play:\n\\[ \\text{Total games} = 40 + 10 = 50. \\]\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of games the team loses out of the remaining 10 games. This means the team will win \\( 10 - x \\) games out of the remaining 10 games. The total number of games won will then be:\n\\[ \\text{Total games won} = 28 + (10 - x) = 38 - x. \\]\n\nWe want the team to win 60% of their total games, so we set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\frac{38 - x}{50} = 0.60. \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50:\n\\[ 38 - x = 0.60 \\times 50 = 30. \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting 30 from both sides:\n\\[ 38 - 30 = x \\implies x = 8. \\]\n\nTherefore, the team can lose \\(\\boxed{8}\\) games to win 60% of their games.",
        "To determine how many games the basketball team can lose to win 60% of their games, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of games the team has already won.\n2. Determine the total number of games the team will play.\n3. Set up an equation to find out how many games the team can lose to win 60% of their total games.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of games the team has already won.**\n\nThe team played 40 games and won 70% of them.\n\\[ 0.70 \\times 40 = 28 \\]\nSo, the team has already won 28 games.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of games the team will play.**\n\nThe team still has 10 games to play. Therefore, the total number of games they will play is:\n\\[ 40 + 10 = 50 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Set up an equation to find out how many games the team can lose to win 60% of their total games.**\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of games the team loses out of the remaining 10 games. Then, the team will win \\( 10 - x \\) games out of the remaining 10 games. The total number of games won will be:\n\\[ 28 + (10 - x) = 38 - x \\]\n\nWe want the team to win 60% of their total games. So, we set up the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{38 - x}{50} = 0.60 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 50:\n\\[ 38 - x = 0.60 \\times 50 \\]\n\\[ 38 - x = 30 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting 30 from both sides:\n\\[ 38 - 30 = x \\]\n\\[ x = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the team can lose \\(\\boxed{8}\\) games to win 60% of their games."
