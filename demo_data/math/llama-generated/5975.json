Determine how many boxes of crackers Calvin bought.\n3. Calculate the number of crackers Calvin bought.\n4. Add the number of crackers Darren and Calvin bought together.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of crackers Darren bought. Darren bought 4 boxes of crackers, and each box contains 24 crackers. Therefore, the total number of crackers Darren bought is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 24 = 96 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many boxes of crackers Calvin bought. Calvin bought one box less than twice as many boxes of crackers as Darren. Since Darren bought 4 boxes, twice as many boxes as Darren is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\nSo, Calvin bought one box less than 8 boxes, which is:\n\\[ 8 - 1 = 7 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of crackers Calvin bought. Calvin bought 7 boxes of crackers, and each box contains 24 crackers. Therefore, the total number of crackers Calvin bought is:\n\\[ 7 \\times 24 = 168 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of crackers Darren and Calvin bought together:\n\\[ 96 + 168 = 264 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of crackers they bought altogether is:\n\\[ \\boxed{264} \\]",
