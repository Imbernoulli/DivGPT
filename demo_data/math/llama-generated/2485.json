        "To determine the total number of vacations and classes that Grant and Kelvin have altogether, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many vacations Grant has.\n2. Add the number of vacations Grant has to the number of classes Kelvin has.\n\nFirst, we know that Grant has four times as many vacations as Kelvin has classes. Since Kelvin has 90 classes, we can calculate the number of vacations Grant has by multiplying 90 by 4:\n\\[\n4 \\times 90 = 360\n\\]\nSo, Grant has 360 vacations.\n\nNext, we add the number of vacations Grant has to the number of classes Kelvin has to find the total number of vacations and classes:\n\\[\n360 + 90 = 450\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of vacations and classes that Grant and Kelvin have altogether is \\boxed{450}.",
