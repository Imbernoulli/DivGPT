Also in the pool was a lawn chair that had been blown twice as far as the car had been transported.  And the pool also contained a birdhouse that had flown through the air three times farther than the lawn chair had been blown.  How far, in feet, far had the birdhouse flown?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
