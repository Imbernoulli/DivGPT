        "To determine the total number of cats you have, we need to consider both the adult cats and the kittens. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the number of adult cats. According to the problem, you have 2 adult cats.\n2. Identify the number of kittens. The problem states you have 3 female kittens and 2 male kittens. To find the total number of kittens, we add the number of female kittens to the number of male kittens:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ (female kittens)} + 2 \\text{ (male kittens)} = 5 \\text{ (kittens)}\n   \\]\n3.
