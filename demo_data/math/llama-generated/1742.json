Calculate the total earnings from the new company.\n3. Add the earnings from both companies together.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total earnings from the old company.**\n\n Cadence worked at her old company for 3 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of months she worked at the old company as follows:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ years} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 36 \\text{ months} \\]\n\n She earned $5000 per month, so the total earnings from the old company are:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ months} \\times 5000 \\text{ dollars/month} = 180000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings from the new company.**\n\n Cadence worked at her new company five months longer than she worked at her old company. Therefore, the total number of months she worked at the new company is:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ months} + 5 \\text{ months} = 41 \\text{ months} \\]\n\n She earns 20% more at the new company than she did at the old company. First, we calculate 20% of her old company's monthly wage:\n\\[ 5000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 0.20 = 1000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\n Adding this to her old company's monthly wage, her new company's monthly wage is:\n\\[ 5000 \\text{ dollars/month} + 1000 \\text{ dollars/month} = 6000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\n So, the total earnings from the new company are:\n\\[ 41 \\text{ months} \\times 6000 \\text{ dollars/month} = 246000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the earnings from both companies together.**\n\n The total amount of money Cadence has earned in both companies is:\n\\[ 180000 \\text{ dollars} + 246000 \\text{ dollars} = 426000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money she has earned in both companies is \\(\\boxed{426000}\\).",

She worked there for 3 years, which is equivalent to \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\) months. She earned $5000 per month, so the total earnings at her old company are:\n\\[\n36 \\times 5000 = 180000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how long Cadence has worked for her new company. She has worked for her new company five months longer than she worked for her old company, so she has worked for:\n\\[\n36 + 5 = 41 \\text{ months}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate Cadence's monthly earnings at her new company. She is earning 20% more than she was at her old company. Her monthly earnings at her old company were $5000, so her monthly earnings at her new company are:\n\\[\n5000 + 0.20 \\times 5000 = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThe total amount of money Cadence earned at her new company is:\n\\[\n41 \\times 6000 = 246000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the amounts earned at both companies to get the total:\n\\[\n180000 + 246000 = 426000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Cadence has earned in both companies is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{426000}\n\\]",
