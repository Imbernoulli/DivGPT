        "To determine the total number of minutes Jeff ran in the week, we need to calculate his running time for each day and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the running time for each day from Monday to Wednesday. Jeff ran for an hour each day, which is equivalent to 60 minutes per day. Therefore, for three days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), the total running time is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the running time for Thursday. Jeff cut short his run by 20 minutes, so he ran:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ minutes} - 20 \\text{ minutes} = 40 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the running time for Friday. Jeff ran 10 minutes more than his usual hour, so he ran:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ minutes} + 10 \\text{ minutes} = 70 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we sum the running times for all five days:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ minutes} + 40 \\text{ minutes} + 70 \\text{ minutes} = 290 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of minutes Jeff was able to run for that week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{290} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of minutes Jeff ran in the week, we start by calculating the sodal running time for the weekdays without any adjustments. Since Jeff committed to run for an hour each day and there are 5 weekdays, we have:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ days} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/day} = 300 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we account for the changes in his running time on Thursday and Friday. On Thursday, he cut short his run by 20 minutes, so he ran:\n\n\\[ 60 \\text{ minutes} - 20 \\text{ minutes} = 40 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nOn Friday, he jogged 10 minutes more than usual, so he ran:\n\n\\[ 60 \\text{ minutes} + 10 \\text{ minutes} = 70 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we substitute these adjusted times back into the total running time calculation. The total running time for the week is the sum of the running times for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Since he ran 60 minutes each day for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we have:\n\n\\[ 60 \\text{ minutes} + 60 \\text{ minutes} + 60 \\text{ minutes} + 40 \\text{ minutes} + 70 \\text{ minutes} = 290 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of minutes Jeff was able to run for that week is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{290} \\]",
        "To determine how many minutes Jeff was able to run for that week, we start by calculating the total length of his planned runs for the weekdays.

For Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, he ran 60 minutes each day, so we calculate:\n\n\\[ 60 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nAdding the running times for Thursday and Friday, we get:\n\n\\[ 180 \\text{ minutes} + 40 \\text{ minutes} + 70 \\text{ minutes} = 290 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of minutes Jeff was able to run for that week is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{290} \\]",

        "To determine the total number of minutes Jeff ran in the week, we start by calculating the minutes he ran each day and then summing them up.\n\nFirst, we note that Jeff committed to run for 60 minutes each day from Monday to Friday. However, on Thursday, he cut short his run by 20 minutes, and on Friday, he jogged 10 minutes more than his usual 60 minutes.\n\nLet's calculate the minutes run each day:\n- Monday: 60 minutes\n- Tuesday: 60 minutes\n- Wednesday: 60 minutes\n- Thursday: \\(60 - 20 = 40\\) minutes\n- Friday: \\(60 + 10 = 70\\) minutes\n\nNext, we sum the minutes run over the five days:\n\\[\n60 + 60 + 60 + 40 + 70\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify the addition step by step:\n\\[\n60 + 60 = 120\n\\]\n\\[\n120 + 60 = 180\n\\]\n\\[\n180 + 40 = 220\n\\]\n\\[\n220 + 70 = 290\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of minutes Jeff was able to run for that week is \\(\\boxed{290}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of minutes Jeff ran in the week, we start by calculating the number of minutes he was supposed to run each day and then adjust for the_probe minutes he cut short and the extra minutes he jogged.\n\n1. **Calculate the total minutes Hunter was supposed to run in the week:**\n   - Jeff committed to run for 1 hour each day.\n   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.\n   - Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the total minutes he was supposed to run is:\n     \\[\n     60 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 300 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Adjust for the minutes he cut short on Thursday:**\n   - On Thursday, Jeff cut short his run by 20 minutes.\n   - Therefore, he ran:\n     \\[\n     60 \\text{ minutes} - 20 \\text{ minutes} = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Adjust for the minutes he jogged extra on Friday:**\n   - On Friday, Jeff jogged 10 minutes more than usual.\n   - Therefore, he ran:\n     \\[\n     60 \\text{ minutes} + 10 \\text{ minutes} = 70 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total minutes he actually ran in the week:**\n   - For the other three days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), he ran the full 60 minutes each day:\n     \\[\n     60 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 180 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Adding the minutes he ran on Thursday and Friday:\n     \\[\n     180 \\text{ minutes} + 40 \\text{ minutes} + 70 \\text{ minutes} = 290 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of minutes Jeff was able to run for that week is \\(\\boxed{290}\\).",
