        "To find the average amount of hours that Brady worked per month in April, June, and September, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours Brady worked in each month.\n2. Sum the total hours worked over the three months.\n3. Divide the total hours by the number of months (which is 3).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total hours Brady worked in April. April has 30 days, and Brady worked 6 hours each day. So, the total hours worked in April is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 6 = 180 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total hours Brady worked in June. June has 30 days, and Brady worked 5 hours each day. So, the total hours worked in June is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 5 = 150 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the total hours Brady worked in September. September has 30 days, and Brady worked 8 hours each day. So, the total hours worked in September is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 8 = 240 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we sum the total hours worked over the three months:\n\\[ 180 + 150 + 240 = 570 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we divide the total hours by the number of months (which is 3) to find the average amount of hours worked per month:\n\\[ \\frac{570}{3} = 190 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the average amount of hours that Brady worked per month in those 3 months is:\n\\[ \\boxed{190} \\]",
