        "To determine how many chickens Carla has after buying more chickens, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of chickens that died due to disease.\n2. Determine how many chickens Carla bought.\n3. Add the number of chickens bought to the number of chickens remaining after the disease.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of chickens that died. Carla initially had 400 chickens and 40% of them died. Therefore, the number of chickens that died is:\n\\[\n400 \\times 0.40 = 160\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many chickens Carla bought. She bought ten times as many chickens as the number that died. So, the number of chickens she bought is:\n\\[\n10 \\times 160 = 1600\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of chickens she bought to the number of chickens remaining after the disease. After the disease, the number of chickens remaining is:\n\\[\n400 - 160 = 240\n\\]\nAdding the chickens she bought, the total number of chickens now is:\n\\[\n240 + 1600 = 1840\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of chickens Carla has now is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1840}\n\\]",
        "First, we need to determine how many chickens died due to the disease. Carla initially had 400 chickens, and 40% of them died. So, we calculate the number ofuds that died as follows:\n\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 400 = 160\n\\]\n\nThis means that 160 chickens died. Next, we need to find out how many chickens Carla bought. She bought ten times as many chickens as the number that died. Therefore, the number of chickens she bought is:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 160 = 1600\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the total number of chickens Carla has after buying the new chickens. Initially, she had 400 chickens, but 160 of them died, so the number of chickens left after the disease is:\n\n\\[\n400 - 160 = 240\n\\]\n\nAdding the 1600 chickens she bought, the total number of chickens she has now is:\n\n\\[\n240 + 1600 = 1840\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of chickens Carla has is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1840}\n\\]",
