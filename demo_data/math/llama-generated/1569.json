Shane buys 2 packages of sliced bread, and each package contains 20 slices.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 20 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, Shane has 40 slices of bread.\n\n2. Shane buys 2 packages of sliced ham, and each package contains 8 slices.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 8 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Shane has 16 slices of ham.\n\n3. Shane will make as many sandwiches as he has ham. Since each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread and 1 slice of ham, the number of sandwiches he can make is equal to the number of slices of ham.\n   \\[\n   16\n   \\]\n   So, Shane can make 16 sandwiches.\n\n4. Each sandwich uses 2 slices of bread, so the total number of slices of bread used in the sandwiches is:\n   \\[\n   16 \\times 2 = 32\n   \\]\n   So, Shane uses 32 slices of bread.\n\n5. To find the number of slices of bread Shane has leftover, we subtract the number of slices of bread used from the total number of slices of bread:\n   \\[\n   40 - 32 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, Shane has 8 slices of bread leftover.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",
