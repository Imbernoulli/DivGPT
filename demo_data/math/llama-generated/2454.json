        "To determine how many pieces of meat are on each slice of pizza, we first need to calculate the total number of each type of meat Lisa uses.\n\n1. **Pepperoni:**\n   Lisa uses 30 pieces of pepperoni.\n\n2. **Ham:**\n   Lisa uses twice as many pieces of ham as pepperoni. Therefore, the number of pieces of ham is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 30 = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sausage:**\n   Lisa uses 12 more pieces of sausage than pepperoni. Therefore, the number of pieces of sausage is:\n   \\[\n   30 + 12 = 42\n   \\]\n\nNext, we sum the total number of pieces of meat:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ (pepperoni)} + 60 \\text{ (ham)} + 42 \\text{ (sausage)} = 132\n\\]\n\nSince the pizza is divided into 6 slices and the meat is distributed evenly, we divide the total number of pieces of meat by the number of slices:\n\\[\n\\frac{132}{6} = 22\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of pieces of meat on each slice is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{22}\n\\]",

Since she uses 30 pieces of pepperoni, the number of pieces of ham is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of pieces of sausage. Lisa uses 12 more pieces of sausage than pepperoni. Since she uses 30 pieces of pepperoni, the number of pieces of sausage is:\n\\[ 30 + 12 = 42 \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total number of pieces of meat. We add the number of pieces of pepperoni, ham, and sausage:\n\\[ 30 + 60 + 42 = 132 \\]\n\nFinally, we divide the total number of pieces of meat by the number of slices to find out how many pieces of meat are on each slice. Since there are 6 slices, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{132}{6} = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of meat altogether on each slice is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",

        "To determine how many pieces of meat are on each slice of pizza, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of each type of meat Lisa uses and then divide that total by the number of slices.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pieces of each type of meat:\n- Lisa uses 30 pieces of pepperoni.\n- Lisa uses twice as many pieces of ham as pepperoni. Therefore, the number of pieces of ham is \\(2 \\times 30 = 60\\).\n- Lisa uses 12 more pieces of sausage than pepperoni. Therefore, the number of pieces of sausage is \\(30 + 12 = 42\\).\n\nNext, we find the total number of pieces of meat by adding the pieces of pepperoni, ham, and sausage:\n\\[\n30 + 60 + 42 = 132\n\\]\n\nSince there are 6 slices of pizza and the meat is distributed evenly, we divide the total number of pieces of meat by the number of slices:\n\\[\n\\frac{132}{6} = 22\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of pieces of meat on each slice is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",
