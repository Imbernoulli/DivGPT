        "To determine the total number of hours Percy swims over 4 weeks, we need to break down his weekly swimming schedule and then multiply by 4.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of hours Percy swims during the weekdays:\n- Percy swims 1 hour before school and 1 hour after school each day.\n- Therefore, he swims \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) hours per day.\n- He swims 5 days a week.\n\nSo, the total number of hours he swims during the weekdays in one week is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 10 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of hours Percy swims on the weekend:\n- He swims 3 hours on the weekend.\n\nSo, the total number of hours he swims in one week is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ hours/week (weekdays)} + 3 \\text{ hours/week (weekend)} = 13 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of hours he swims over 4 weeks:\n\\[ 13 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 52 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Percy swims over 4 weeks is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{52}\n\\]",
