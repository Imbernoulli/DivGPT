        "To determine how much more money Mrs. Smith will still need after the discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:**\n   Mrs. Smith initially wanted to buy items worth $500, but she realized she needed two-fifths more money than she had. First, we need to find out how much more money she needed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional money needed} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 500 = \\frac{2 \\times 500}{5} = 200\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total cost of the items is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 500 + 200 = 700\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the discount amount:**\n   The shop owner gave her a discount of 15%. To find the discount amount, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount amount} = 15\\% \\times 700 = \\frac{15}{100} \\times 700 = 105\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**\n   After applying the discount, the total cost of the items is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost after discount} = 700 - 105 = 595\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how much more money Mrs. Smith needs:**\n   Mrs. Smith initially had $500. To find out how much more money she still needs, we subtract the amount she had from the total cost after the discount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional money needed} = 595 - 500 = 95\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Smith still needs \\(\\boxed{95}\\) dollars.",
