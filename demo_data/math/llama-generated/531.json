Therefore, the total number of songs played in the first, second, and encore sets is:\n\\[12 + 2 = 14\\]\n\nSince the band has 30 songs in their repertoire and they have already played 14 songs (first set, second set, and encore), the number of songs left to be played is:\n\\[30 - 14 = 16\\]\n\nThese remaining 16 songs will be played in the third and fourth sets.
