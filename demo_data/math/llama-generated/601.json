Sum the total costs for all types of machines.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of each type of machine.**\n\n- The cost of each bike is $700.\n- The cost of each treadmill is $700 + 0.5 \\times 700 = $700 + $350 = $1050.\n- The cost of each elliptical machine is $1050 \\times 2 = $2100.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of each type of machine.**\n\n- Each gym has 10 bikes, 5 treadmills, and 5 elliptical machines.\n- There are 20 gyms.\n\n- The total number of bikes is \\(10 \\times 20 = 200\\).\n- The total number of treadmills is \\(5 \\times 20 = 100\\).\n- The total number of elliptical machines is \\(5 \\times 20 = 100\\).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for each type of machine.**\n\n- The total cost for the bikes is \\(200 \\times 700 = 140000\\).\n- The total cost for the treadmills is \\(100 \\times 1050 = 105000\\).\n- The total cost for the elliptical machines is \\(100 \\times 2100 = 210000\\).\n\n**Step 4: Sum the total costs for all types of machines.**\n\nThe total cost to replace all the cardio machines is \\(140000 + 105000 + 210000 = 455000\\).\n\nTherefore, the total cost to replace everything is \\(\\boxed{455000}\\).",
        "To determine the total cost of replacing all the cardio machines in the gyms, we need to calculate the cost for each type of machine and then sum these costs for all the gyms.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of each type of machine:\n- The cost of each bike is $700.\n- The cost of each treadmill is 50% more than the cost of a bike.

Therefore, the cost of each elliptical machine is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 1050 = 2100\n  \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for each type of machine in one gym:\n- The total cost for the bikes in one gym is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 700 = 7000\n  \\]\n- The total cost for the treadmills in one gym is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 1050 = 5250\n  \\]\n- The total cost for the elliptical machines in one gym is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 2100 = 10500\n  \\]\n\nNow, we find the total cost for all the machines in one gym by summing the costs of the bikes, treadmills, and elliptical machines:\n\\[\n7000 + 5250 + 10500 = 22750\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost for all 20 gyms:\n\\[\n20 \\times 22750 = 455000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost to replace all the cardio machines is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{455000}\n\\]",

        "To determine the total cost of replacing all the cardio machines in the gyms, we need to calculate the cost for each type of machine and then sum these costs for all the gyms.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of each type of machine:\n- The cost of each bike is $700.\n- The cost of each treadmill is 50% more than the cost of a bike. Therefore, the cost of each treadmill is:\n  \\[\n  700 + 0.5 \\times 700 = 700 + 350 = 1050 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- The cost of each elliptical machine is twice the cost of a treadmill. Therefore, the cost of each elliptical machine is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 1050 = 2100 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the machines in one gym:\n- Each gym has 10 bikes, so the cost of the bikes in one gym is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 700 = 7000 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- Each gym has 5 treadmills, so the cost of the treadmills in one gym is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 1050 = 5250 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- Each gym has 5 elliptical machines, so the cost of the elliptical machines in one gym is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 2100 = 10500 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the total cost of the machines in one gym is:\n  \\[\n  7000 + 5250 + 10500 = 22750 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total cost for all 20 gyms:\n\\[\n20 \\times 22750 = 455000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost to replace all the cardio machines is \\(\\boxed{455000}\\).",
