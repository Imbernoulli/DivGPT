        "To determine how many more minutes Peter has to walk to reach the grocery store, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance Peter still has to walk.\n2. Determine how long it takes Peter to walk the remaining distance.\n\nFirst, we find out how many miles Peter still has to walk. Since Peter has already walked 1 mile out of the total 2.5 miles, we subtract the distance he has already walked from the total distance:\n\\[ 2.5 \\text{ miles} - 1 \\text{ mile} = 1.5 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to walk the remaining 1.5 miles.

        "To determine how many more minutes Peter has to walk to reach the grocery store, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the remaining distance Peter needs to walk:**\n   Peter has already walked 1 mile out of the total 2.5 miles. Therefore, the remaining distance is:\n   \\[\n   2.5 \\text{ miles} - 1 \\text{ mile} = 1.5 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the time it takes to walk the remaining distance:**\n   Peter walks at a rate of 20 minutes per mile. To find out how many minutes it takes to walk 1.5 miles, we multiply the distance by the rate:\n   \\[\n   1.5 \\text{ miles} \\times 20 \\text{ minutes per mile} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Peter has \\(\\boxed{30}\\) more minutes to walk to reach the grocery store.",
        "To determine how many more minutes Peter has to walk to reach the grocery store, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the remaining distance Peter needs to walk.\n2. Determine how long it takes Peter to walk the remaining distance.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much distance Peter still needs to walk. Peter has already walked 1 mile out of the total 2.5 miles. So, the remaining distance is:\n\\[ 2.5 \\text{ miles} - 1 \\text{ mile} = 1.5 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes Peter to walk the remaining 1.5 miles.
