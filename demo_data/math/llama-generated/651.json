        "To determine the depth of the river by mid-July, we need to follow the changes in depth step by step.\n\n1. **Depth in mid-May**: The river is 5 feet deep.\n2. **Depth in mid-June**: The river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May. Therefore, we add 10 feet to the depth in mid-May:\n   \\[\n   5 + 10 = 15 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   So, the river is 15 feet deep in mid-June.\n3. **Depth in mid-July**: The river is three times deeper than mid-June. Therefore, we multiply the depth in mid-June by 3:\n   \\[\n   15 \\times 3 = 45 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   So, the river is 45 feet deep in mid-July.\n\nThe final depth of the river by mid-July is \\(\\boxed{45}\\) feet."
