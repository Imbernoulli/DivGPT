        "To determine how many slices of cake were kept, we start by finding out how many slices were eaten by Lovely's visitors. Since the cake was cut into 12 equal pieces and one-fourth of the cake was eaten, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Slices eaten} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many slices were kept. Since the total number of slices is 12 and 3 slices were eaten, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Slices kept} = 12 - 3 = 9\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of slices of cake that were kept is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",

Therefore, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Slices eaten} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many slices were kept. Since the total number of slices is 12 and 3 slices were eaten, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Slices kept} = 12 - 3 = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of slices of cake that were kept is \\boxed{9}.",
