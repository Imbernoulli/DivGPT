        "To determine how many comics James has written over 4 years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days in 4 years.\n2. Determine how many comics James writes given that he writes one comic every other day.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of days in 4 years. Since there is no leap year, each year has 365 days. Therefore, the total number of days in 4 years is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 365 = 1460 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many comics James writes. Since he writes one comic every other day, we divide the total number of days by 2:\n\\[ \\frac{1460}{2} = 730 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of comics James has written is:\n\\[ \\boxed{730} \\]",
