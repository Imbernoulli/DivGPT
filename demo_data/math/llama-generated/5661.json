        "To determine how many balloons each friend has after Dante's change of mind, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial number of balloons each friend received:**\n   Dante started with 250 balloons and shared them equally among his 5 friends.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial balloons per friend} = \\frac{250}{5} = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many balloons each friend gave back to Dante:**\n   Dante asked each friend to give him 11 balloons.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Balloons given back per friend} = 11\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of balloons each friend has after giving some back:**\n   Subtract the number of balloons given back from the initial number of balloons each friend received.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Balloons per friend after giving back} = 50 - 11 = 39\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each friend now has \\(\\boxed{39}\\) balloons.",
        "First, we need to determine how many balloons each of Dante's friends initially received. Since there are 250 balloons and Dante shared them evenly among his 5 friends, we divide 250 by 5:\n\n\\[ 250 \\div 5 = 50 \\]\n\nSo, each friend initially received 50 balloons. Next, Dante asked each friend to give him 11 balloons. Therefore, each friend will now have:\n\n\\[ 50 - 11 = 39 \\]\n\nThus, each friend now has \\(\\boxed{39}\\) balloons.",
