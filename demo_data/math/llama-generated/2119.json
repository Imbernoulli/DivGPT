        "To determine the number of boxes needed to ship 5000 brochures, we start by noting that each box can contain one-fifth of the brochures. We can calculate the number of brochures each box can hold by dividing the total number of brochures by 5:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of brochures per box} = \\frac{5000}{5} = 1000\n\\]\n\nThis means each box can hold 1000 brochures. To find out how many boxes are required to ship all 5000 brochures, we divide the total number of brochures by the number of brochures each box can hold:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of boxes needed} = \\frac{5000}{1000} = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of boxes needed to ship the brochures is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
