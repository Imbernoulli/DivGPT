        "To determine the total number of calories in Jason's salad, we need to add up the calories from each ingredient. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total calories from the croutons:\n   - Each crouton has 20 calories.\n   - There are 12 croutons.\n   - Total calories from croutons = \\( 12 \\times 20 = 240 \\) calories.\n\n2. Add the calories from the lettuce:\n   - The lettuce has 30 calories.\n   - Total calories from lettuce = 30 calories.\n\n3. Add the calories from the cucumber:\n   - The cucumber has 80 calories.\n   - Total calories from cucumber = 80 calories.\n\n4. Sum up the calories from all the ingredients:\n   - Total calories = calories from lettuce + calories from cucumber + calories from croutons\n   - Total calories = 30 + 80 + 240\n\n5. Perform the addition:\n   - \\( 30 + 80 = 110 \\)\n   - \\( 110 + 240 = 350 \\)\n\nTherefore, the total number of calories in the salad is \\(\\boxed{350}\\).",
