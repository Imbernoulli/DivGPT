        "To determine the total catering budget for Jenny's wedding, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of guests who want steak and the number of guests who want chicken.\n2. Determine the cost of the steak entrees.\n3. Determine the cost of the chicken entrees.\n4. Add the costs of the steak entrees and the chicken entrees to get the total catering budget.\n\nLet's start with step 1. We know that the total number of guests is 80 and that 3 times as many guests want steak as chicken. Let's denote the number of guests who want chicken as \\( C \\). Therefore, the number of guests who want steak is \\( 3C \\). According to the problem, the total number of guests is the sum of the guests who want steak and the guests who want chicken. So, we can write the equation:\n\\[ C + 3C = 80 \\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 4C = 80 \\]\nTo find \\( C \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[ C = 20 \\]\nSo, the number of guests who want chicken is 20. Since 3 times as many guests want steak as chicken, the number of guests who want steak is:\n\\[ 3C = 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we move to step 2 and determine the cost of the steak entrees. Each steak entree costs $25, so the total cost for the steak entrees is:\n\\[ 60 \\times 25 = 1500 \\]\n\nThen, we move to step 3 and determine the cost of the chicken entrees. Each chicken entree costs $18, so the total cost for the chicken entrees is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 18 = 360 \\]\n\nFinally, we move to step 4 and add the costs of the steak entrees and the chicken entrees to get the total catering budget:\n\\[ 1500 + 360 = 1860 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total catering budget is \\(\\boxed{1860}\\).",
