        "To determine how many slices of pizza were left, we start by calculating how many slices John and Sam each ate.\n\nFirst, we know that John ate 3 slices. Sam ate twice the amount that John ate, so we calculate:\n\\[ 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\]\nThis means Sam ate 6 slices.\n\nNext, we find the total number of slices eaten by both John and Sam by adding the slices John ate to the slices Sam ate:\n\\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \\]\nSo, the total number of slices eaten is 9.\n\nThe pizza was originally sliced into 12 pieces. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the original number of slices:\n\\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \\]\nTherefore, the number of slices of pizza left is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
