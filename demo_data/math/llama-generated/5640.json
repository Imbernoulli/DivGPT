Calculate the annual rent collected from the occupied units.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of units occupied in the building.**\n\nThe building has 100 units, and it is 3/4 occupied. Therefore, the number of occupied units is:\n\\[\n100 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 75\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the monthly rent collected from the occupied units.**\n\nEach resident pays a rent of $400, so the monthly rent collected from 75 units is:\n\\[\n75 \\times 400 = 30000\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the annual rent collected from the occupied units.**\n\nSince the monthly rent collected is $30,000, the annual rent collected is:\n\\[\n30000 \\times 12 = 360000\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Mr. Maximilian receives in that year is \\(\\boxed{360000}\\).",
        "To determine the amount of money Mr. Maximilian receives in a year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of occupied units in the building.\n2. Determine the total rent paid by all the occupied units in one month.\n3. Calculate the total rent paid by all the occupied units in a year.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of occupied units in the building. The building has 100 units and it is 3/4 occupied:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of occupied units} = 100 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 75\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the total rent paid by all the occupied units in one month. Each resident pays $400, so the total rent paid in one month is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total rent per month} = 75 \\times 400 = 30000\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total rent paid by all the occupied units in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so the total rent paid in a year is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total rent per year} = 30000 \\times 12 = 360000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Mr. Maximilian receives in that year is \\boxed{360000}.",
