        "To determine the total amount of fabric Jenson and Kingsley need every 3 days, we need to calculate the fabric used by each person per day and then multiply by 3.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the fabric used by Jenson per day. Jenson makes 3 shirts per day, and each shirt uses 2 yards of fabric. Therefore, the fabric used by Jenson per day is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ shirts/day} \\times 2 \\text{ yards/shirt} = 6 \\text{ yards/day} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the fabric used by Kingsley per day.
