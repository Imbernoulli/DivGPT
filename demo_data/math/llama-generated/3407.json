        "To determine the total number of students at the middle school, we start by understanding that 20% of the students are in the band. This means that the number of students in the band is 20% of the total number of students. We can represent this relationship with the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of students in the band} = 0.20 \\times \\text{Total number of students} \\]\n\nWe know that the number of students in the band is 168. So, we can substitute 168 for the number of students in the band in the equation:\n\n\\[ 168 = 0.20 \\times \\text{Total number of students} \\]\n\nTo find the total number of students, we need to solve for the total number of students. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.20:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of students} = \\frac{168}{0.20} \\]\n\nPerforming the division, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of students} = 840 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students at the middle school is \\(\\boxed{840}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of students at the middle school, we start by letting \\( x \\) represent the total number of students. According to the problem, 20% of the students are in the band, which means that the number of students in the band is 0.20 times the total number of students. We are given that 168 students are in the band, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 0.20x = 168 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we need to isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation.
