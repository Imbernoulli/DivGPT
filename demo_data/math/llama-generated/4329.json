        "To determine Laran's profit per 5-day school week, we need to calculate her daily profit first and then multiply it by 5.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of each type of poster Laran sells in one day:\n- Total posters sold per day: 5\n- Large posters sold per day: 2\n- Small posters sold per day: \\(5 - 2 = 3\\)\n\nNext, we calculate the daily revenue from each type of poster:\n- Revenue from large posters per day: \\(2 \\text{ posters} \\times \\$10/\\text{posters} = \\$20\\)\n- Revenue from small posters per day: \\(3 \\text{ posters} \\times \\$6/\\text{posters} = \\$18\\)\n- Total daily revenue: \\(\\$20 + \\$18 = \\$38\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the daily cost of producing each type of poster:\n- Cost of large posters per day: \\(2 \\text{ posters} \\times \\$5/\\text{posters} = \\$10\\)\n- Cost of small posters per day: \\(3 \\text{ posters} \\times \\$3/\\text{posters} = \\$9\\)\n- Total daily cost: \\(\\$10 + \\$9 = \\$19\\)\n\nNext, we calculate the daily profit:\n- Daily profit: \\(\\$38 - \\$19 = \\$19\\)\n\nFinally, we calculate the profit for a 5-day school week:\n- Weekly profit: \\(5 \\text{ days} \\times \\$19/\\text{day} = \\$95\\)\n\nThus, Laran's profit per 5-day school week is \\(\\boxed{95}\\).",
        "To determine Laran's profit per 5-day school week, we need to calculate her daily profit and then multiply it by 5.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many large and small posters Laran sells in a day. She sells 5 posters per day, and 2 of them are large posters. Therefore, the number of small posters she sells per day is:\n\\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the daily revenue from the large posters. Each large poster sells for $10, and she sells 2 large posters per day. So, her daily revenue from large posters is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the daily revenue from the small posters. Each small poster sells for $6, and she sells 3 small posters per day. So, her daily revenue from small posters is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the revenue from the large posters and the small posters gives us her total daily revenue:\n\\[ 20 + 18 = 38 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the daily cost of producing the posters. The cost to produce each large poster is $5, and she sells 2 large posters per day. So, her daily cost for large posters is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe cost to produce each small poster is $3, and she sells 3 small posters per day. So, her daily cost for small posters is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the cost of producing the large posters and the small posters gives us her total daily cost:\n\\[ 10 + 9 = 19 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate her daily profit by subtracting the total daily cost from the total daily revenue:\n\\[ 38 - 19 = 19 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince Laran works for 5 days in a school week, her total profit for the week is:\n\\[ 19 \\times 5 = 95 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, Laran's profit per 5-day school week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{95} \\]",

Multiply the total daily profit by 5 to get the weekly profit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily profit from the large posters. Laran sells 2 large posters per day, and each large poster sells for $10. The cost to make each large poster is $5. Therefore, the profit from each large poster is:\n\\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nSo, the daily profit from the large posters is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the daily profit from the small posters. Laran sells 3 small posters per day (since she sells a total of 5 posters per day and 2 of them are large), and each small poster sells for $6. The cost to make each small poster is $3. Therefore, the profit from each small poster is:\n\\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nSo, the daily profit from the small posters is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the daily profits from both types of posters to get the total daily profit:\n\\[ 10 + 9 = 19 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the total daily profit by 5 to get the weekly profit:\n\\[ 19 \\times 5 = 95 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Laran's profit per 5-day school week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{95} \\]",
