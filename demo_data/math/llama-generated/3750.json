        "To determine the cost of the annual subscription after the discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the subscription without the discount.\n2. Determine the amount of the discount.\n3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount to be paid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the subscription without the discount. Since the subscription costs $10 per month and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply $10 by 12:\n\\[\n10 \\times 12 = 120\n\\]\nSo, the total cost without the discount is $120.\n\nNext, we need to determine the amount of the discount. The discount is 20%, so we calculate 20% of $120. To find 20% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.20:\n\\[\n120 \\times 0.20 = 24\n\\]\nSo, the discount amount is $24.\n\nFinally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount to be paid:\n\\[\n120 - 24 = 96\n\\]\nTherefore, the amount you end up paying if you go with the annual subscription is \\boxed{96}.",

Determine the discount amount.\n3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost of the monthly subscription.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of a monthly subscription over one year. Since the subscription costs $10 per month, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):\n\\[\n10 \\times 12 = 120\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of a monthly subscription over one year is $120.\n\nNext, we need to determine the discount amount. The discount is 20% of the total cost of the monthly subscription. To find 20% of $120, we multiply $120 by 0.20:\n\\[\n120 \\times 0.20 = 24\n\\]\nSo, the discount amount is $24.\n\nFinally, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost of the monthly subscription to find the cost of the annual subscription:\n\\[\n120 - 24 = 96\n\\]\nTherefore, the amount you end up paying if you go with the annual subscription is \\boxed{96}.",

To find out how much the discount is in dollars, we calculate 20% of $120:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 120 = 24 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost.**\n\nTo find the final cost of the annual subscription, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ dollars} - 24 \\text{ dollars} = 96 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount you end up paying if you go with the annual subscription is:\n\\[ \\boxed{96} \\]",
        "To determine the cost of the annual subscription with the discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the subscription without the discount.\n2. Determine the amount of the discount.\n3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount to be paid.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The monthly subscription cost is $10. Therefore, the total cost for a year (12 months) without the discount is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months} = 120 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. The discount is 20% of the total cost. To find the amount of the discount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20):\n   \\[\n   120 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.20 = 24 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount to be paid:\n   \\[\n   120 \\text{ dollars} - 24 \\text{ dollars} = 96 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount you end up paying if you go with the annual subscription is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of an annual newspaper subscription with a 20% discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of a monthly subscription over one year.\n2.

        "To determine the cost of an annual newspaper subscription with the discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of a monthly subscription over one year.\n2. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of a monthly subscription over one year. Since the monthly cost is $10, we multiply this by 12 (the number of months in a year):\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 12 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, the total cost of a monthly subscription over one year is $120.\n\nNext, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means we pay 80% of the total cost (since 100% - 20% = 80%). To find out what 80% of $120 is, we multiply $120 by 0.80:\n\n\\[\n120 \\times 0.80 = 96\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount you end up paying if you go with the annual subscription is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
