        "To determine Grant's total earnings over the three months, we will calculate his earnings for each month and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First Month:**\n   Grant made $350.\n\n2. **Second Month:**\n   Grant made $50 more than double what he made the first month.\n   - Double the first month's earnings: \\( 2 \\times 350 = 700 \\)\n   - Add $50 to this amount: \\( 700 + 50 = 750 \\)\n   So, Grant made $750 in the second month.\n\n3. **Third Month:**\n   Grant quadrupled the sum of the first two months.\n   - Sum of the first two months: \\( 350 + 750 = 1100 \\)\n   - Quadruple this sum: \\( 4 \\times 1100 = 4400 \\)\n   So, Grant made $4400 in the third month.\n\n4. **Total Earnings:**\n   Sum of the earnings from all three months:\n   \\[\n   350 + 750 + 4400 = 5500\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Grant made a total of \\(\\boxed{5500}\\) dollars in his first three months.",
        "To determine how much Grant made in his first three months, we need to calculate his earnings for each month and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that Grant made $350 in the first month.\n\nNext, we need to calculate his earnings for the second month.

The problem states that he quadrupled the sum of the first two months. First, we find the sum of the first two months:\n\\[ 350 + 750 = 1100 \\]\nThen, we quadruple this sum:\n\\[ 4 \\times 1100 = 4400 \\]\nSo, Grant made $4400 in the third month.\n\nFinally, we sum up his earnings for all three months:\n\\[ 350 + 750 + 4400 = 5500 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Grant made in his first three months is \\(\\boxed{5500}\\).",
