Last year, the race was 300 meters. This year, it will be 4 times as long. Giselle needs to set up 6 tables for the relay run. The distance between the tables must be the same and the last table will be at the finish line. What is the distance between table 1 and table 3 in meters?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
