        "To determine how many free-throws Annieka made, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of free-throws Kayla made.\n2. Use the result from step 1 to find out how many free-throws Annieka made.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many free-throws Kayla made. We know that Kayla made 50% more free-throws than DeShawn. DeShawn made 12 free-throws. Therefore, we can calculate Kayla's free-throws as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Kayla's free-throws} = 12 + (0.5 \\times 12) = 12 + 6 = 18\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many free-throws Annieka made. We know that Annieka made 4 fewer free-throws than Kayla. Since Kayla made 18 free-throws, we can calculate Annieka's free-throws as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Annieka's free-throws} = 18 - 4 = 14\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of free-throws Annieka made is \\boxed{14}.",

Use the result from step 1 to find out how many free-throws Annieka made.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of free-throws Kayla made. Kayla made 50% more free-throws than DeShawn. DeShawn made 12 free-throws. To find out how many more free-throws Kayla made than DeShawn, we multiply DeShawn's total by 50% (which is the same as multiplying by 0.50):\n\n\\[ 12 \\times 0.50 = 6 \\]\n\nSo, Kayla made 6 more free-throws than DeShawn.

Since Kayla made 18 free-throws, we subtract 4 from 18:\n\n\\[ 18 - 4 = 14 \\]\n\nSo, Annieka made \\(\\boxed{14}\\) free-throws.",
