Next, we calculate the total cost of three burgers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of three burgers} = 3 \\times \\text{Cost of one burger} = 3 \\times 9 = 27\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, we add the cost of one pizza to the total cost of three burgers to find the total cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of one pizza} + \\text{Total cost of three burgers} = 18 + 27 = 45\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of one pizza and three burgers is \\boxed{45}.",
