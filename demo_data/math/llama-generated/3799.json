        "To determine how many chocolate chips are left uneaten, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cookies Danny made.\n2. Determine how many cookies were eaten.\n3. Calculate the number of cookies that were left uneaten.\n4. Find out the total number of chocolate chips in the uneaten cookies.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of cookies Danny made. Since he made 4 dozen cookies and one dozen equals 12 cookies, we have:\n\\[\n4 \\times 12 = 48\n\\]\nSo, Danny made 48 cookies.\n\nNext, we determine how many cookies were eaten. Since the class ate half of the cookies, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{48}{2} = 24\n\\]\nSo, 24 cookies were eaten.\n\nThen, we calculate the number of cookies that were left uneaten. Since 24 cookies were eaten out of 48, the number of uneaten cookies is:\n\\[\n48 - 24 = 24\n\\]\nSo, 24 cookies were left uneaten.\n\nFinally, we find out the total number of chocolate chips in the uneaten cookies. Since each cookie has 7 chocolate chips, the total number of chocolate chips in the uneaten cookies is:\n\\[\n24 \\times 7 = 168\n\\]\nSo, the number of chocolate chips left uneaten is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{168}\n\\]",

Since one dozen equals 12 cookies, we multiply:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 12 = 48\n   \\]\n   So, Danny made 48 cookies.\n\n2. **Determine how many cookies were eaten:**\n   The class eats half of the cookies. Therefore, we calculate half of 48:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{48}{2} = 24\n   \\]\n   So, 24 cookies were eaten.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of cookies left uneaten:**\n   Subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies:\n   \\[\n   48 - 24 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, 24 cookies are left uneaten.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of chocolate chips on the uneaten cookies:**\n   Each cookie has 7 chocolate chips. Therefore, we multiply the number of uneaten cookies by the number of chips per cookie:\n   \\[\n   24 \\times 7 = 168\n   \\]\n   So, there are 168 chocolate chips left uneaten.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{168}\n\\]",
