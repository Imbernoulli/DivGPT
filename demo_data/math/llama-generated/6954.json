        "To determine the total cost of the aquarium, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the reduced price of the aquarium after the 50% discount.\n2. Calculate the sales tax on the reduced price.\n3. Add the sales tax to the reduced price to get the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the reduced price of the aquarium. The original price is $120, and it was marked down by 50%. So, the reduced price is:\n\\[\n120 \\times (1 - 0.50) = 120 \\times 0.50 = 60\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the sales tax. The sales tax is 5% of the reduced price. So, the sales tax is:\n\\[\n60 \\times 0.05 = 3\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the sales tax to the reduced price to get the total cost:\n\\[\n60 + 3 = 63\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the aquarium is \\(\\boxed{63}\\).",

Therefore, the reduced price is:\n\\[\n120 \\times (1 - 0.50) = 120 \\times 0.50 = 60\n\\]\nSo, the reduced price of the aquarium is $60.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the sales tax. The sales tax is 5% of the reduced price. Therefore, the sales tax is:\n\\[\n60 \\times 0.05 = 3\n\\]\nSo, the sales tax is $3.\n\nFinally, we add the sales tax to the reduced price to get the total cost:\n\\[\n60 + 3 = 63\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the aquarium is \\(\\boxed{63}\\).",

Calculate the sales tax on the reduced price.\n3. Add the sales tax to the reduced price to get the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the reduced price of the aquarium. The original price is $120, and it was marked down by 50%. Therefore, the reduced price is:\n\\[\n120 \\times (1 - 0.50) = 120 \\times 0.50 = 60\n\\]\nSo, the reduced price of the aquarium is $60.\n\nNext, we calculate the sales tax.
