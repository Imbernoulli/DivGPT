        "To determine the total time Missy spends watching TV, we need to calculate the time spent on the reality shows and the cartoon separately, and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time spent on the reality shows. Missy watches 5 reality shows, and each show is 28 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent on the reality shows is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 28 = 140 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, let's consider the time spent on the cartoon. Missy watches one cartoon that is 10 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent on the cartoon is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we add the time spent on the reality shows and the cartoon to find the total time spent watching TV:\n\\[ 140 + 10 = 150 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThus, the total time Missy spends watching TV is \\(\\boxed{150}\\) minutes.",
