        "To determine Jame's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of buying and feeding the cattle, and then subtract that from the total revenue from selling the cattle. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of buying the cattle:**\n   Jame's buys 100 head of cattle for $40,000.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of buying the cattle} = \\$40,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of feeding the cattle:**\n   It costs 20% more to feed the cattle than it does to buy them. First, we find 20% of $40,000.\n   \\[\n   20\\% \\text{ of } \\$40,000 = 0.20 \\times \\$40,000 = \\$8,000\n   \\]\n   Adding this to the original cost of buying the cattle gives us the total cost of feeding the cattle.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of feeding the cattle} = \\$40,000 + \\$8,000 = \\$48,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of buying and feeding the cattle:**\n   We add the cost of buying the cattle and the cost of feeding the cattle.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\$40,000 + \\$48,000 = \\$88,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the cattle:**\n   Each head of cattle weighs 1000 pounds and sells for $2 per pound. First, we find the total weight of all the cattle.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight} = 100 \\text{ head} \\times 1000 \\text{ pounds æ head} = 100,000 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n   Then, we calculate the total revenue from selling the cattle.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = 100,000 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per pound} = \\$200,000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the profit:**\n   We subtract the total cost from the total revenue.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = \\$200,000 - \\$88,000 = \\$112,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jame's profit is \\(\\boxed{112000}\\).",
        "To determine Jame's profit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of feeding the cattle.\n2. Determine the total revenue from selling the cattle.\n3. Subtract the total costs (initial cost plus feeding cost) from the total revenue to find the profit.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of feeding the cattle.**\n\nThe initial cost of buying the cattle is $40,000. The cost of feeding them is 20% more than the initial cost. Therefore, we calculate the feeding cost as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Feeding cost} = 40,000 + 0.20 \\times 40,000 = 40,000 + 8,000 = 48,000 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the cattle.**\n\nEach cattle weighs 1000 pounds and sells for $2 per pound. Jame's has 100 head of cattle, so the total weight of the cattle is:\n\\[ \\text{Total weight} = 100 \\times 1000 = 100,000 \\text{ pounds} \\]\nThe total revenue from selling the cattle is:\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = 100,000 \\times 2 = 200,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the total costs from the total revenue to find the profit.**\n\nThe total cost of buying and feeding the cattle is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 40,000 + 48,000 = 88,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nThe profit is:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 200,000 - 88,000 = 112,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, Jame's profit is:\n\\[ \\boxed{112000} \\]"
