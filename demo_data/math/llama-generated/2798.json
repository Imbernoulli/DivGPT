Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 48 = 3A \\]\n\nTo find \\( A \\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 3:\n\\[ A = \\frac{48}{3} = 16 \\]\n\nSo, Oliver has 16 Alien Baseball cards. Next, we need to find the number of Monster Club cards. The problem states that Oliver has twice as many Monster Club cards as Alien Baseball cards. Therefore, the number of Monster Club cards is:\n\\[ 2A = 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\]\n\nThus, the number of Monster Club cards Oliver has is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
