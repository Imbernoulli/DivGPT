        "To determine the total amount of money Keanu spent at the store to buy all the fish, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of fish given to the cat:**\n   - Keanu gave his cat half as many fish as he gave to his dog.\n   - He gave his dog 40 fish.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fish given to the cat} = \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of fish bought:**\n   - Keanu gave 40 fish to his dog.\n   - Keanu gave 20 fish to his cat.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of fish} = 40 + 20 = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the fish:**\n   - Each fish cost $4.\n   - The total number of fish is 60.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 60 \\times 4 = 240\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Keanu spent at the store to buy all the fish is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",

Since he gave his dog 40 fish, we can calculate the number of fish he gave to his cat as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fish given to the cat} = \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Find the total number of fish Keanu bought.**\n\nTo find the total number of fish Keanu bought, we add the number of fish he gave to his dog and the number of fish he gave to his cat:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of fish} = 40 + 20 = 60\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all the fish.**\n\nEach fish cost Keanu $4, so the total cost of all the fish is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 60 \\times 4 = 240\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Keanu spent at the store to buy all the fish is \\boxed{240}.",
        "To determine the total amount of money Keanu spent at the store, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of fish given to the cat:**\n   Keanu gave his cat half as many fish as he gave to his dog.
