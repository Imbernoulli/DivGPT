        "To determine Esperanza's gross monthly salary, we need to calculate her total expenses and savings, and then sum them up.

Since her savings are $2000, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount paid in taxes} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 2000 = 800 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the gross monthly salary:**\n   The gross monthly salary is the sum of the total amount spent on rent, food, and mortgage, her savings, and her taxes. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross monthly salary} = 2040 + 2000 + 800 = 4840 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Esperanza's gross monthly salary is \\(\\boxed{4840}\\).",
