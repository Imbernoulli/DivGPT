        "To determine the total number of hours Lila and Roger watched, we need to calculate the time each of them spent watching one video and then multiply by the number of videos they watched.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Lila spent watching one video. Since Lila watches the video at two times the average speed, it will take her half the time it takes to watch the video at the average speed. The original length of the video is 100 hours, so Lila will take:\n\\[\n\\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nto watch one video.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Roger spent watching one video. Since Roger watches the video at the average speed, it will take him the full 100 hours to watch one video.\n\nNow, we need to find out the total time each of them spent watching six videos. For Lila, the total time is:\n\\[\n50 \\times 6 = 300 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nFor Roger, the total time is:\n\\[\n100 \\times 6 = 600 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the total time Lila and Roger spent watching the videos to get the overall total time:\n\\[\n300 + 600 = 900 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours they watched is \\(\\boxed{900}\\).",

The original length of the video is 100 hours, so Lila will take:\n\\[\n\\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nto watch one video.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Roger spends watching one video. Since Roger watches the video at the average speed, he will take the full 100 hours to watch it.\n\nNow, we need to find out the total time each of them spends watching six videos. For Lila, watching six videos will take:\n\\[\n6 \\times 50 = 300 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nFor Roger, watching six videos will take:\n\\[\n6 \\times 100 = 600 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTo find the total number of hours they both watched, we add the time Lila spent watching the videos to the time Roger spent watching the videos:\n\\[\n300 + 600 = 900 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours they watched is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{900}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of hours Lila and Roger watched, we need to calculate the time each of them spends watching one video and then multiply by the number of videos they watched.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Lila spends watching one video. Since Lila watches the video at two times the average speed, she will take half the time to watch the video compared to watching it at the average speed. The original length of the video is 100 hours, so Lila will take:\n\\[\n\\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nto watch one video.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Roger spends watching one video.
