        "To determine Thomas's total bill including shipping, we first need to calculate the total cost of his purchases. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the shirts:**\n   Thomas orders 3 shirts, each costing $12.00.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 12 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the pack of socks:**\n   Thomas orders 1 pack of socks, costing $5.00.\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 5 = 5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the shorts:**\n   Thomas orders 2 pairs of shorts, each costing $15.00.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 15 = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the cost of the swim trunks:**\n   Thomas orders 1 pair of swim trunks, costing $14.00.\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 14 = 14\n   \\]\n\n5. **Add up the costs of all the items:**\n   \\[\n   36 + 5 + 30 + 14 = 85\n   \\]\n\nNow that we know the total cost of the purchases is $85.00, we need to determine the shipping cost. Since the total purchase price is above $50.00, the shipping cost is 20% of the purchase price.\n\n6. **Calculate the shipping cost:**\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 85 = 17\n   \\]\n\n7. **Add the shipping cost to the total purchase price:**\n   \\[\n   85 + 17 = 102\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Thomas's total bill, including shipping, is \\(\\boxed{102}\\).",
