Gas used to drive to the doctor's office: 2 gallons.\n   \\[\n   4 - 2 = 2 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   So, after driving to the doctor's office, Winston has 2 gallons of gas left.\n4. Determine how much gas is left in the tank: 2 gallons.\n5. Calculate how much more gas is needed to fill the tank to its full capacity. The tank can hold up to 12 gallons.\n   \\[\n   12 - 2 = 10 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   So, Winston needs 10 more gallons of gas to refill the entire tank.\n\nThe answer is \\boxed{10}.",
