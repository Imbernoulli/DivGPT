We will track the number of sodas he drinks each week until it reaches 6.\n\nWeek 0: Jerry drinks 48 sodas.\nWeek 1: Jerry drinks \\( \\frac{48}{2} = 24 \\) sodas.\nWeek 2: Jerry drinks \\( \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\) sodas.\nWeek 3: Jerry drinks \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\) sodas.\n\nAfter 3 weeks, Jerry is drinking 6 sodas per week. Therefore, it will take him \\(\\boxed{3}\\) weeks to only drink 6 sodas per week.",
        "To determine how many weeks it will take Jerry to drink only 6 sodas per week if he cuts the number of sodas he drinks in half each week, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of sodas Jerry drinks in a week, which is 48.\n2. Each week, Jerry drinks half of the sodas he drank the previous week.\n3. We need to find out how many weeks it takes for the number of sodas to reach 6.\n\nLet's calculate the number of sodas Jerry drinks each week:\n\n- Week 0: \\( 48 \\) sodas\n- Week 1: \\( \\frac{48}{2} = 24 \\) sodas\n- Week 2: \\( \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\) sodas\n- Week 3: \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\) sodas\n\nWe see that after 3 weeks, Jerry drinks 6 sodas per week.
