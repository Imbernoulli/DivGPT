        "To determine the year the third car was made, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the manufacture year of the first car.\n2. Use the information about the first car to find the manufacture year of the second car.\n3. Use the information about the second car to find the manufacture year of the third car.\n\nLet's start with the first car:\n- The first car was made in 1970.\n\nThe second car was made 10 years later than the first car:\n- Therefore, the manufacture year of the second car is \\(1970 + 10 = 1980\\).\n\nThe third car was made 20 years after the second car:\n- Therefore, the manufacture year of the third car is \\(1980 + 20 = 2000\\).\n\nThus, the year that the third car was made is \\(\\boxed{2000}\\).",

        "To determine the year the third car was manufactured, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the manufacture year of the second car.\n2. Use the manufacture year of the second car to find the manufacture year of the third car.\n\nWe know the following:\n- The first car was made in 1970.\n- The first car was made 10 years earlier than the second car.\n\nLet's denote the manufacture year of the second car as \\( y_2 \\). According to the problem, the first car was made 10 years earlier than the second car, so we can write:\n\\[ 1970 = y_2 - 10 \\]\n\nTo find \\( y_2 \\), we add 10 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ y_2 = 1970 + 10 = 1980 \\]\n\nNow we know the second car was made in 1980. The problem also states that the third car was manufactured 20 years after the second car. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ y_3 = y_2 + 20 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( y_2 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ y_3 = 1980 + 20 = 2000 \\]\n\nSo, the year that the third car was made is \\(\\boxed{2000}\\).",
