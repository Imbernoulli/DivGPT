        "To determine how many gallons of gas Kennedy started with, we need to calculate the total distance she drove and then divide that by the car's fuel efficiency.\n\nFirst, let's add up all the distances she drove:\n- Distance to school: 15 miles\n- Distance to the softball park: 6 miles\n- Distance to a burger restaurant: 2 miles\n- Distance to her friend’s house: 4 miles\n- Distance home: 11 miles\n\nAdding these distances together:\n\\[\n15 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 11\n\\]\n\nWe can add them step by step:\n\\[\n15 + 6 = 21\n\\]\n\\[\n21 + 2 = 23\n\\]\n\\[\n23 + 4 = 27\n\\]\n\\[\n27 + 11 = 38\n\\]\n\nSo, the total distance Kennedy drove is 38 miles.\n\nNext, we use the car's fuel efficiency to find out how many gallons of gas she started with. The car drives 19 miles per gallon. Therefore, we divide the total distance by the miles per gallon:\n\\[\n\\frac{38}{19}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this division:\n\\[\n\\frac{38}{19} = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, Kennedy started with \\boxed{2} gallons of gas.",
