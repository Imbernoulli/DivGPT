        "To determine the total number of fish in Catriona's aquarium, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that Catriona has 8 goldfish. This is given directly:\n\\[ \\text{Number of goldfish} = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that she has 4 more angelfish than goldfish. Therefore, we can calculate the number of angelfish as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of angelfish} = \\text{Number of goldfish} + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 \\]\n\nThen, we are told that she has twice as many guppies as angelfish. Therefore, we can calculate the number of guppies as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of guppies} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of angelfish} = 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of goldfish, angelfish, and guppies to find the total number of fish in the aquarium:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of fish} = \\text{Number of goldfish} + \\text{Number of angelfish} + \\text{Number of guppies} = 8 + 12 + 24 = 44 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of fish in Catriona's aquarium is:\n\\[ \\boxed{44} \\]",
