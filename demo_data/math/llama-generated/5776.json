        "To determine the total cost of the orders that Paulo and Jeremy will be charged for, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the soda.\n2. Determine the total cost of the items Paulo wants to buy.\n3. Determine the total cost of the items Jeremy wants to buy.\n4. Add the total costs of Paulo's and Jeremy's orders together.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the soda. The soda costs \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) as much as the burger meal. Since the burger meal costs $6, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of the soda} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's determine the total cost of the items Paulo wants to buy. Paulo wants to get 1 burger meal and 1 soda, so we add their costs together:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost for Paulo} = 6 + 2 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine the total cost of the items Jeremy wants to buy. Jeremy wants to get 2 burger meals and 2 sodas, so we multiply the cost of one burger meal and one soda by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost for Jeremy} = 2 \\times (6 + 2) = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's add the total costs of Paulo's and Jeremy's orders together:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost for both} = 8 + 16 = 24 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount they will be charged for their orders combined is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
