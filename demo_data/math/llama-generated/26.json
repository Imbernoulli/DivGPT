        "To determine how many text messages per week John is getting that are not intended for him, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

The weekly increase will give us the number of text messages per week that are not intended for him.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\nThe number of text messages John used to get each day is 20. Now he is getting 55 text messages each day. The increase in the number of text messages per day is:\n\\[ 55 - 20 = 35 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many additional text messages John is getting each week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily increase by 7:\n\\[ 35 \\times 7 = 245 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of text messages per week that John is getting that are not intended for him is:\n\\[ \\boxed{245} \\]",

The increase is:\n\\[ 55 - 20 = 35 \\text{ text messages per day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many additional text messages he is receiving per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily increase by 7:\n\\[ 35 \\times 7 = 245 \\text{ text messages per week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of text messages per week that John is getting that are not intended for him is \\(\\boxed{245}\\).",

Use this daily increase to find out how many additional text messages he receives in a week.\n\nFirst, we find the increase in the number of text messages John is receiving each day. John used to receive 20 text messages a day and now he is receiving 55 text messages a day. So, the increase in the number of text messages per day is:\n\\[ 55 - 20 = 35 \\]\n\nThis means John is receiving 35 additional text messages each day that are not intended for him. To find out how many additional text messages he receives in a week, we multiply the daily increase by 7 (the number of days in a week):\n\\[ 35 \\times 7 = 245 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of text messages per week that John is getting that are not intended for him is:\n\\[ \\boxed{245} \\]",
