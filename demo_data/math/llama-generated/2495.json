        "To determine how many pages Carter can read in one hour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many pages Lucy can read in one hour.\n2. Use the information about Lucy's reading speed to find out how many pages Carter can read in one hour.\n\nFirst, we know that Oliver can read 40 pages in one hour. According to the problem, Lucy can read 20 more pages than Oliver in one hour. Therefore, we can calculate Lucy's reading speed as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Lucy's reading speed} = \\text{Oliver's reading speed} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \\text{ pages per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Carter can read half as many pages as Lucy in one hour. Therefore, we can calculate Carter's reading speed as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Carter's reading speed} = \\frac{\\text{Lucy's reading speed}}{2} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\text{ pages per hour}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of pages Carter can read in one hour is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
