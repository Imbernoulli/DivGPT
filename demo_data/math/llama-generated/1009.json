        "To determine how many miles the second dog averages per day, we start by calculating the total number of miles the first dog walks in a week. Since the first dog walks an average of 2 miles a day, we multiply this by the number of days in a week:\n\n\\[ 2 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 14 \\text{ miles/week} \\]\n\nNext, we know that the total distance walked by both dogs in a week is 70 miles. To find out how many miles the second dog walks in a week, we subtract the distance walked by the first dog from the total distance:\n\n\\[ 70 \\text{ miles/week} - 14 \\text{ miles/week} = 56 \\text{ miles/week} \\]\n\nNow, to find the average number of miles the second dog walks per day, we divide the weekly distance by the number of days in a week:\n\n\\[ 56 \\text{ miles/week} \\div 7 \\text{ days/week} = 8 \\text{ miles/day} \\]\n\nTherefore, the second dog averages \\(\\boxed{8}\\) miles a day.",

Divide the weekly miles walked by the second dog by 7 to find the average daily miles walked by the second dog.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The first dog walks an average of 2 miles a day. Therefore, in a week (which has 7 days), the first dog walks:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 14 \\text{ miles/week} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the miles walked by the first dog from the total miles walked by both dogs in a week. The total miles walked by both dogs is 70 miles per week. So, the miles walked by the second dog in a week is:\n\\[ 70 \\text{ miles/week} - 14 \\text{ miles/week} = 56 \\text{ miles/week} \\]\n\nFinally, we divide the weekly miles walked by the second dog by 7 to find the average daily miles walked by the second dog:\n\\[ 56 \\text{ miles/week} \\div 7 \\text{ days/week} = 8 \\text{ miles/day} \\]\n\nTherefore, the second dog averages \\(\\boxed{8}\\) miles a day.",
        "To determine how many miles a day the second dog average, we start by calculating the total number of miles the first dog walks in a week.
