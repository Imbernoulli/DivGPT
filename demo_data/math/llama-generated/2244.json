        "To determine how many liters of water Gumball drank on Wednesday, we need to sum up the amounts he drank on the other days of the week and then subtract this total from the overall total for the week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of water Gumball drank on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday. He drank 9 liters each day on these three days:\n\\[ 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of water Gumball drank on Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday.

Calculate the total amount of water Gumball drank on the days for which data is available.\n2. Subtract the total amount of water Known from the total amount of water consumed for the week to find the amount drunk on Wednesday.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of water Gumball drank on the days for which data is available:\n- On Monday, Thursday, and Saturday, he drank 9 liters each day.\n- On Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday, he drank 8 liters each day.\n\nThe total amount of water drunk on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday is:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ liters/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 27 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nThe total amount of water drunk on Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ liters/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 24 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nAdding these amounts together gives the total amount of water drunk on these six days:\n\\[ 27 \\text{ liters} + 24 \\text{ liters} = 51 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nSince the total amount of water drunk for the week is 60 liters, the amount of water drunk on Wednesday is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ liters} - 51 \\text{ liters} = 9 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of water Gumball drank on Wednesday is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
        "To determine how many liters of water Gumball drank on Wednesday, we start by calculating the total amount of water he drank on the other days of the week.\n\nFirst, we calculate the water intake for the days when he drank 9 liters:\n- Monday: 9 liters\n- Thursday: 9 liters\n- Saturday: 9 liters\n\nAdding these amounts together:\n\\[\n9 + 9 + 9 = 27 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the water intake for the days when he drank 8 liters:\n- Tuesday: 8 liters\n- Friday: 8 liters\n- Sunday: 8 liters\n\nAdding these amounts together:\n\\[\n8 + 8 + 8 = 24 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the water intake from all the days we have data for:\n\\[\n27 \\text{ liters} + 24 \\text{ liters} = 51 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nGumball drank a total of 60 liters of water for the week. To find out how many liters he drank on Wednesday, we subtract the total water intake for the other days from the total water intake for the week:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ liters} - 51 \\text{ liters} = 9 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nThus, Gumball drank \\(\\boxed{9}\\) liters of water on Wednesday."
