        "To determine how many papers Ms. Alice can grade in 11 hours, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the rate at which Ms. Alice grades papers. This is the number of papers she grades per hour.\n2. Use this rate to calculate the number of papers she can grade in 11 hours.\n\nFirst, let's find the rate at which Ms. Alice grades papers. She grades 296 papers in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate is:\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{296 \\text{ papers}}{8 \\text{ hours}} = 37 \\text{ papers per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we use this rate to calculate the number of papers she can grade in 11 hours:\n\\[\n\\text{Papers in 11 hours} = 37 \\text{ papers per hour} \\times 11 \\text{ hours} = 407 \\text{ papers}\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of papers Ms. Alice can grade in 11 hours is \\boxed{407}.",
