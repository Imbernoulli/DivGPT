If he eats 10 sandwiches every day, the number of apples he eats per day is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ apples/sandwich} \\times 10 \\text{ sandwiches/day} = 40 \\text{ apples/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many apples Sam eats in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily apple consumption by 7:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ apples/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 280 \\text{ apples/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of apples Sam eats in one week is \\(\\boxed{280}\\).",

        "To determine how many apples Sam eats in one week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many apples Sam eats in one day. According to the problem, for every sandwich he eats, Sam eats four apples. Since Sam eats 10 sandwiches every day, we can calculate the number of apples he eats in one day as follows:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ sandwiches/day} \\times 4 \\text{ apples/sandwich} = 40 \\text{ apples/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many apples Sam eats in one week.
