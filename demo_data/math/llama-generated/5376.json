        "To determine the average price Chris paid per movie, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the DVDs.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the Blu-rays.\n3. Find the total cost of all the movies.\n4. Determine the total number of movies.\n5. Calculate the average price per movie.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the DVDs. Chris bought 8 DVDs at $12 each:\n\\[\n8 \\times 12 = 96\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the DVDs is $96.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the Blu-rays. Chris bought 4 Blu-rays at $18 each:\n\\[\n4 \\times 18 = 72\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the Blu-rays is $72.\n\nNow, we find the total cost of all the movies by adding the total cost of the DVDs and the total cost of the Blu-rays:\n\\[\n96 + 72 = 168\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of all the movies is $168.\n\nNext, we determine the total number of movies. Chris bought 8 DVDs and 4 Blu-rays:\n\\[\n8 + 4 = 12\n\\]\nSo, the total number of movies is 12.\n\nFinally, we calculate the average price per movie by dividing the total cost of all the movies by the total number of movies:\n\\[\n\\frac{168}{12} = 14\n\\]\nSo, the average price Chris paid per movie is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
