Subtract the sum of these two quantities from the total number of cars to find the number of cars that cost between $15000 and $20000.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of cars that cost less than $15000.

Since 40% of the cars fall into this category, we have:\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 3000 = 1200 \\text{ cars} \\]\n\nNow, we find the total number of cars that cost either less than $15000 or more than $20000 by adding the two quantities together:\n\\[ 450 + 1200 = 1650 \\text{ cars} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract this total from the total number of cars to find the number of cars that cost between $15000 and $20000:\n\\[ 3000 - 1650 = 1350 \\text{ cars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cars that cost between $15000 and $20000 is \\(\\boxed{1350}\\).",

Since 40% of the cars cost more than $20000 and there are 3000 cars at the dealership, we have:\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 3000 = 1200 \\]\nSo, 1200 cars cost more than $20000.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of cars that cost between $15000 and $20000. We do this by subtracting the number of cars that cost less than $15000 and the number of cars that cost more than $20000 from the total number of cars:\n\\[ 3000 - 450 - 1200 = 1350 \\]\nSo, the number of cars that cost between $15000 and $20000 is \\(\\boxed{1350}\\).",

        "To determine how many cars at the dealership cost between $15000 and $20000, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cars that cost less than $15000.\n2. Calculate the number of cars that cost more than $20000.\n3. Subtract the sum of the cars from steps 1 and 2 from the total number of cars to find the number of cars that cost between $15000 and $20000.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The total number of cars at the dealership is 3000. Since 15% of the cars cost less than $15000, we calculate:\n\\[ 0.15 \\times 3000 = 450 \\]\nSo, 450 cars cost less than $15000.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of cars that cost more than $20000. Since 40% of the cars cost more than $20000, we calculate:\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 3000 = 1200 \\]\nSo, 1200 cars cost more than $20000.\n\nNow, we add the number of cars that cost less than $15000 and the number of cars that cost more than $20000:\n\\[ 450 + 1200 = 1650 \\]\nSo, 1650 cars cost either less than $15000 or more than $20000.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of cars that cost either less than $15000 or more than $20000 from the total number of cars to find the number of cars that cost between $15000 and $20000:\n\\[ 3000 - 1650 = 1350 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cars that cost between $15000 and $20000 is \\(\\boxed{1350}\\).",

Subtract the sum of these two quantities from the total number of cars to find the number of cars that cost between $15000 and $20000.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of cars that cost less than $15000. We know that 15% of the cars fall into this category. Since there are 3000 cars at the dealership, we can find this number by multiplying 3000 by 15% (or 0.15):\n\n\\[\n0.15 \\times 3000 = 450\n\\]\n\nSo, 450 cars cost less than $15000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of cars that cost more than $20000. We know that 40% of the cars fall into this category. Again, since there are 3000 cars at the dealership, we can find this number by multiplying 3000 by 40% (or 0.40):\n\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 3000 = 1200\n\\]\n\nSo, 1200 cars cost more than $20000.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of cars that cost between $15000 and $20000. We do this by subtracting the number of cars that cost less than $15000 and the number of cars that cost more than $20000 from the total number of cars:\n\n\\[\n3000 - 450 - 1200 = 1350\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cars that cost between $15000 and $20000 is \\boxed{1350}.",
        "To determine how many cars at the dealership cost between $15000 and $20000, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cars that cost less than $15000.\n2.
