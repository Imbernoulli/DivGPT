        "To determine how many problems Georgia has left to solve, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of problems Georgia has completed so far.\n2. Subtract the number of problems she has completed from the total number of problems on the test.\n\nFirst, we know that after the first 20 minutes, Georgia has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Therefore, after 40 minutes, she has completed:\n\\[ 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\text{ problems} \\]\n\nNext, we add the problems completed in the first 20 minutes to the problems completed in the next 20 minutes:\n\\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \\text{ problems} \\]\n\nThe test has a total of 75 problems. To find out how many problems Georgia has left to solve, we subtract the number of problems she has completed from the total number of problems:\n\\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \\]\n\nThus, the number of problems Georgia has left to solve is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{45}\n\\]",

Calculate the number of problems Georgia completes in the next 20 minutes.\n3. Determine the total number of problems she has completed so far.\n4. Subtract the total number of problems completed from the total number of problems on the test to find out how many problems she has left to solve.\n\nFirst, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Georgia completes 10 problems.\n\nNext, in the following 20 minutes, she completes twice as many problems as she did in the first 20 minutes. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[ 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ problems} \\]\n\nNow, we add the problems completed in the first 20 minutes to the problems completed in the next 20 minutes to find the total number of problems she has completed so far:\n\\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \\text{ problems} \\]\n\n Georgia has 40 minutes left to complete the rest of the test. The total number of problems on the test is 75. To find out how many problems she has left to solve, we subtract the number of problems she has already completed from the total number of problems:\n\\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \\text{ problems} \\]\n\nThus, the number of problems Georgia has left to solve is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",

Subtract the total number of problems completed from the total number of problems on the test to find out how many problems she has left to solve.\n\nLet's start with the first step. After the first 20 minutes, Georgia has completed 10 problems.\n\nNext, after another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she completed 10 problems in the first 20 minutes, she completes \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) problems in the next 20 minutes.\n\nNow, let's add the problems completed in the first 20 minutes to the problems completed in the next 20 minutes to find the total number of problems she has completed so far:\n\\[10 + 20 = 30\\]\n\nGeorgia has completed 30 problems so far.

Subtract the total number of problems completed from the total number of problems on the test to find out how many problems are left.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. After the first 20 minutes, Georgia has completed 10 problems.\n2. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems as she did after the first 20 minutes. Since she completed 10 problems in the first 20 minutes, she completes \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) problems in the next 20 minutes.\n3. The total number of problems completed after 40 minutes is the sum of the problems completed in the first 20 minutes and the problems completed in the next 20 minutes. Therefore, she has completed \\(10 + 20 = 30\\) problems after 40 minutes.\n4. The total number of problems on the test is 75. To find out how many problems are left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems: \\(75 - 30 = 45\\).\n\nThus, the number of problems Georgia has left to solve is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
