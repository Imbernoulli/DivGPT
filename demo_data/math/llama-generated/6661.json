        "To determine the total number of sacks of strawberries Antoine needs to supply to all the bakeries in 4 weeks, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of sacks needed per week by summing up the weekly requirements of each bakery.\n2. Multiply the total number of sacks needed per week by the number of weeks (which is 4).\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of sacks needed per week:\n- The first bakery needs 2 sacks per week.\n- The second bakery needs 4 sacks per week.\n- The third bakery needs 12 sacks per week.\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[ 2 + 4 + 12 = 18 \\]\nSo, Antoine needs to supply 18 sacks of strawberries per week.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many sacks are needed for 4 weeks:\n\\[ 18 \\times 4 = 72 \\]\n\nTherefore, Antoine needs to supply \\(\\boxed{72}\\) sacks of strawberries to all the bakeries in 4 weeks.",
        "To determine the total number of sacks of strawberries Antoine needs to supply all the bakeries in 4 weeks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many sacks of strawberries each bakery needs per week:\n- The first bakery needs 2 sacks per week.\n- The second bakery needs 4 sacks per week.\n- The third bakery needs 12 sacks per week.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of sacks needed per week by adding the amounts required by each bakery:\n\\[ 2 + 4 + 12 = 18 \\]\nSo, Antoine needs to supply 18 sacks of strawberries per week.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many sacks are needed for 4 weeks.
