The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is equivalent to:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ hour} + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 90 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThe second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first movie, so its duration is:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time spent making popcorn and fries. They spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries, so the time spent making fries is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} = 20 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, let's sum up all the times:\n- Time spent making popcorn: 10 minutes\n- Time spent making fries: 20 minutes\n- Time spent watching the first movie: 90 minutes\n- Time spent watching the second movie: 120 minutes\n\nAdding these times together, we get:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} + 90 \\text{ minutes} + 120 \\text{ minutes} = 240 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTo convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\\[ 240 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Joseph and his friends spent cooking and watching the movies is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]",
