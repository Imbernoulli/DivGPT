        "To determine how many pieces of laundry Carla needs to clean per hour, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total amount of time available:**\n   Carla starts work at 8 AM and needs to finish by noon. The time from 8 AM to noon is 4 hours.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of pieces of laundry per hour:**\n   Carla has 80 pieces of laundry to clean in 4 hours. To find the rate at which she needs to clean, we divide the total number of pieces by the total number of hours:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pieces per hour} = \\frac{80 \\text{ pieces}}{4 \\text{ hours}} = 20 \\text{ pieces per hour}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Carla needs to clean \\boxed{20} pieces of laundry per hour.",
