        "To determine how many tiles Kimiko needs to buy, we first need to calculate the area of her kitchen floor and then divide that area by the area of each tile.\n\n1. Calculate the area of the kitchen floor:\n   The kitchen floor is a rectangle with a length of 72 inches and a width of 48 inches. The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given dimensions:\n   \\[\n   A = 72 \\times 48\n   \\]\n   To find the product, we can use the standard multiplication method:\n   \\[\n   72 \\times 48 = 72 \\times (50 - 2) = 72 \\times 50 - 72 \\times 2 = 3600 - 144 = 3456\n   \\]\n   So, the area of the kitchen floor is 3456 square inches.\n\n2. Calculate the area of each tile:\n   Each tile is a square with a side length of 6 inches. The area \\( A \\) of a square is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\text{side length} \\times \\text{side length}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given side length:\n   \\[\n   A = 6 \\times 6 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, the area of each tile is 36 square inches.\n\n3. Determine the number of tiles needed:\n   To find out how many tiles are required, we divide the area of the kitchen floor by the area of each tile:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of tiles} = \\frac{\\text{Area of the kitchen floor}}{\\text{Area of each tile}} = \\frac{3456}{36}\n   \\]\n   To perform the division:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3456}{36} = 96\n   \\]\n   So, Kimiko needs to buy 96 tiles.\n\nTherefore, the number of tiles Kimiko needs to buy is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
