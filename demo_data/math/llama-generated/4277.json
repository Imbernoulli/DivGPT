        "To determine the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept, we need to work backwards from the information given. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of dust particles on the porch after Samuel walked across it.\n   - According to the problem, there were 331 dust particles after he walked across.\n\n2. Determine the number of dust particles left by Samuel's shoes.\n   - Samuel's shoes left 223 dust particles behind.\n\n3. Calculate the number of dust particles on the porch immediately after Samuel swept but before he walked across.\n   - Since there were 331 dust particles after he walked across and 223 dust particles were left by his shoes, we subtract the number of dust particles left by his shoes from the total number of dust particles after he walked across:\n     \\[\n     331 - 223 = 108\n     \\]\n   - So, there were 108 dust particles on the porch immediately after Samuel swept.\n\n4. Determine the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept.\n   - Samuel cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles from the porch, which means that the 108 dust particles left after he swept represent one-tenth of the original number of dust particles. Let \\( x \\) be the original number of dust particles. Then:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{10}x = 108\n     \\]\n   - To find \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:\n     \\[\n     x = 108 \\times 10 = 1080\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept is \\(\\boxed{1080}\\).",
        "Let's denote the initial number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we know that Samuel swept the porch and cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles.

So, the number of dust particles on the porch after he walked across it is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{10}x + 223. \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, there were 331 dust particles on the porch after Samuel walked across it. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{10}x + 223 = 331. \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first isolate \\( \\frac{1}{10}x \\) by subtracting 223 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{10}x = 331 - 223, \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{10}x = 108. \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 10:\n\\[ x = 108 \\times 10, \\]\n\\[ x = 1080. \\]\n\nThus, the initial number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept is \\(\\boxed{1080}\\).",

Therefore, the total number of dust particles on the porch after he walked across it is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{10}x + 223. \\]\n\nWe know from the problem statement that after Samuel walked across the porch, there were 331 dust particles. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{10}x + 223 = 331. \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first isolate the term involving \\( x \\) by subtracting 223 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{10}x = 331 - 223, \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{10}x = 108. \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 10:\n\\[ x = 108 \\times 10, \\]\n\\[ x = 1080. \\]\n\nThus, the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept is \\(\\boxed{1080}\\).",
        "Let's denote the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, Samuel cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles from the porch. Therefore, the number of dust particles remaining after sweeping is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10}x\n\\]\n\nNext, Samuel walked across the porch and left 223 dust particles behind. After this, the total number of dust particles on the porch was 331. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10}x + 223 = 331\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first isolate the term \\(\\frac{1}{10}x\\) by subtracting 223 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10}x = 331 - 223\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10}x = 108\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 10:\n\\[\nx = 108 \\times 10\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 1080\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept is \\(\\boxed{1080}\\).",
        "To determine the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of dust particles after Samuel swept but before he walked across:**\n   - Samuel walked across the porch and left 223 dust particles behind.\n   - After he walked across, there were 331 dust particles in total.\n   - Therefore, the number of dust particles after Samuel swept but before he walked across is:\n     \\[\n     331 - 223 = 108\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of dust particles before Samuel swept:**\n   - Samuel cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles from the porch.\n   - This means that the 108 dust particles left after he swept represent one-tenth of the original number of dust particles.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the original number of dust particles. Then:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{10}x = 108\n     \\]\n   - To find \\( x \\), multiply both sides of the equation by 10:\n     \\[\n     x = 108 \\times 10 = 1080\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept is \\(\\boxed{1080}\\)."
