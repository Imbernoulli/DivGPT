        "To determine how much time Carly spends practicing swimming in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each stroke separately and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Carly spends practicing her butterfly stroke in a week:\n- She practices her butterfly stroke for 3 hours a day, 4 days a week.\n- Therefore, the weekly time for butterfly stroke is \\(3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days/week} = 12 \\text{ hours/week}\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Carly spends practicing her butterfly stroke in a month:\n- There are 4 weeks in a month.\n- Therefore, the monthly time for butterfly stroke is \\(12 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 48 \\text{ hours/month}\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the time Carly spends practicing her backstroke in a week:\n- She practices her backstroke for 2 hours a day, 6 days a week.\n- Therefore, the weekly time for backstroke is \\(2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 6 \\text{ days/week} = 12 \\text{ hours/week}\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Carly spends practicing her backstroke in a month:\n- There are 4 weeks in a month.\n- Therefore, the monthly time for backstroke is \\(12 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 48 \\text{ hours/month}\\).\n\nFinally, let's sum the monthly times for both strokes to find the total time Carly spends practicing swimming in a month:\n- The total monthly time is \\(48 \\text{ hours/month} + 48 \\text{ hours/month} = 96 \\text{ hours/month}\\).\n\nThus, the total time Carly spends practicing swimming in a month is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
