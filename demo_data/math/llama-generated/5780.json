Calculate the amount of money her brother spent on erasers.\n4. Subtract the amount her brother spent on erasers from the remaining amount to find out how much he spent on highlighters.\n\nLet's start with step 1. Heaven buys two sharpeners and four notebooks. Each sharpeners costs $5 and each notebook costs $5. So, the total cost for Heaven is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 + 4 \\times 5 = 10 + 20 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount Heaven spent from the total amount of money given to them by their father to find out how much money her brother spent:\n\\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's move to step 3. Her brother buys ten erasers. Each eraser costs $4. So, the total cost for her brother on erasers is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the amount her brother spent on erasers from the remaining amount to find out how much he spent on highlighters:\n\\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Heaven's brother spent on highlighters is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
