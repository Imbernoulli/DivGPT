        "To determine how much money Josie had left over after buying all the groceries, we need to calculate the total cost of the items after applying all the discounts and then subtract that from the $20 bill she started with.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of each item after any discounts:\n\n1. **Milk**: The original price is $4.00, but it is 1/2 off.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discounted price of milk} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.00 = 2.00\n   \\]\n\n2. **Bread**: The price is $3.50.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price of bread} = 3.50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Laundry detergent**: The original price is $10.25, but there is a $1.25 coupon.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discounted price of laundry detergent} = 10.25 - 1.25 = 9.00\n   \\]\n\n4. **Bananas**: The price is $0.75 per pound, and Josie bought 2 pounds.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price of bananas} = 0.75 \\times 2 = 1.50\n   \\]\n\nNext, we sum up the discounted prices of all the items:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 2.00 + 3.50 + 9.00 + 1.50\n\\]\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n2.00 + 3.50 = 5.50\n\\]\n\\[\n5.50 + 9.00 = 14.50\n\\]\n\\[\n14.50 + 1.50 = 16.00\n\\]\n\nThe total cost of the groceries is $16.00. Josie started with $20.00, so the amount of money she has left over is:\n\\[\n20.00 - 16.00 = 4.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Josie has left over is \\boxed{4.00}.",

Calculate the total cost of the groceries before any discounts or coupons.\n2. Apply the discounts and coupons to the total cost.\n3. Subtract the final total cost from the amount of money Josie's mom gave her.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the groceries before any discounts or coupons:\n\n- The carton of milk costs $4.00.\n- The loaf of bread costs $3.50.\n- The box of laundry detergent costs $10.25.\n- The 2 pounds of bananas cost $0.75 per pound, so $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.\n\nAdding these amounts together, we get:\n\\[ 4.00 + 3.50 + 10.25 + 1.50 = 19.25 \\]\n\nNext, we apply the discounts and coupons:\n\n- The milk is 1/2 off, so the cost of the milk is $4.00 * (1/2) = $2.00.\n- The coupon for the laundry detergent is $1.25 off, so the cost of the laundry detergent is $10.25 - $1.25 = $9.00.\n\nNow, we recalculate the total cost with the discounts and coupons applied:\n\n- The carton of milk costs $2.00.\n- The loaf of bread costs $3.50.\n- The box of laundry detergent costs $9.00.\n- The 2 pounds of bananas cost $1.50.\n\nAdding these amounts together, we get:\n\\[ 2.00 + 3.50 + 9.00 + 1.50 = 16.00 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the final total cost from the amount of money Josie's mom gave her:\n\n- Josie's mom gave her $20.00.\n- The total cost of the groceries is $16.00.\n\nSo, the amount of money Josie has left over is:\n\\[ 20.00 - 16.00 = 4.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Josie had left over after she bought all of the groceries is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
