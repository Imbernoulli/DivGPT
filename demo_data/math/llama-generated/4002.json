        "To determine how many stop signs per mile Rudolph encountered on his trip across town, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance traveled by Rudolph.\n2. Calculate the total number of stop signs encountered by Rudolph.\n3. Divide the total number of stop signs by the total distance to find the number of stop signs per mile.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance traveled by Rudolph. The problem states that he traveled 2 more than 5 miles. So, we can write the distance as:\n\\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of stop signs encountered by Rudolph. The problem states that he encountered 3 less than 17 stop signs. So, we can write the number of stop signs as:\n\\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \\text{ stop signs} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the number of stop signs per mile. We do this by dividing the total number of stop signs by the total distance traveled:\n\\[ \\frac{14}{7} = 2 \\text{ stop signs per mile} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of stop signs per mile that Rudolph encountered on his trip across town is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
