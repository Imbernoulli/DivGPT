He didn't want to listen to music so he downloaded several podcasts.  The first podcast was 45 minutes long.  The second podcast was twice as long as that.  The third podcast was 1 hour and 45 minutes long.  His fourth podcast is 1 hour long.  How many hours will his next podcast have to be to fill up the full 6 hours?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
