Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[ 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ hours} \\]\nSo, it takes Fernando 40 hours to run all around the two arenas.\n\nNow, we add the times it takes Emma and Fernando to run all around the two arenas:\n\\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes both Emma and Fernando to run all around the two arenas is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
