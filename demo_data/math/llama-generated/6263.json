        "To determine how long it will take John to write 3 books that are each 400 pages, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pages John needs to write.\n2. Determine how many days it will take John to write the total number of pages.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages John needs to write.**\n\nEach book is 400 pages, and John is writing 3 books.\n\\[\n\\text{Total pages} = 3 \\times 400 = 1200\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many days it will take John to write the total number of pages.**\n\nJohn writes 20 pages each day. To find out how many days it will take him to write 1200 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he writes per day.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of days} = \\frac{1200}{20} = 60\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take John \\boxed{60} days to write 3 books that are 400 pages each.",
