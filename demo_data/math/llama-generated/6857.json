of ice cream cones Marco sells.\n   - The price of each ice cream cone is $5.\n   - Marco's total sales for the day is \\( 5x \\) dollars.\n   - Marco's expenses are 80% of his total sales, which is \\( 0.8 \\times 5x = 4x \\) dollars.\n   - Marco's profit is the total sales minus the expenses.\n\n2. **Set up the profit equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = \\text{Total Sales} - \\text{Expenses}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 5x - 4x\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the profit equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the
