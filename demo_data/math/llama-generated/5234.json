        "To determine how many minutes it will take Ben's dog to fetch a potato he launches, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the distance the potato travels into feet:**\n   - Each football field is 200 yards long.\n   - Ben's potato gun can launch a potato 6 football fields.\n   - First, calculate the total distance in yards:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ football fields} \\times 200 \\text{ yards/football field} = 1200 \\text{ yards}\n     \\]\n   - Next, convert yards to feet.

        "To determine how many minutes it will take Ben's dog to fetch a potato he launches, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total distance the potato is launched in feet:**\n   - Each football field is 200 yards long.\n   - Ben's potato gun can launch a potato 6 football fields.\n   - First, convert the distance in yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, we have:\n     \\[\n     200 \\text{ yards} = 200 \\times 3 = 600 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, 6 football fields is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 600 = 3600 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the time it takes for Ben's dog to run 3600 feet:**\n   - Ben's dog runs at a speed of 400 feet per minute.\n   - To find the time, we divide the total distance by the speed:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{3600 \\text{ feet}}{400 \\text{ feet/minute}}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the division:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{3600}{400} = 9 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThus, it will take Ben's dog \\boxed{9} minutes to fetch the potato he launches.",
