        "To determine the total amount Mike spent on shopping, we need to find the cost of each item: the shirt, the wallet, and the food. We know the cost of the food is $30.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of the wallet. The problem states that the wallet costs $60 more than the food. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the wallet as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of the wallet} = \\text{Cost of the food} + 60 = 30 + 60 = 90\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find the cost of the shirt. The problem states that the shirt costs a third of the value of the wallet. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the shirt as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of the shirt} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Cost of the wallet} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 90 = 30\n\\]\n\nNow, we add up the costs of all the items to find the total amount Mike spent:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of the shirt} + \\text{Cost of the wallet} + \\text{Cost of the food} = 30 + 90 + 30 = 150\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Mike spent that day on shopping is \\(\\boxed{150}\\).",

Since the wallet costs $60 more than the food, we can write:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of the wallet} = \\text{Cost of the food} + 60 = 30 + 60 = 90\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the shirt.

Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ S = \\frac{W}{3} = \\frac{90}{3} = 30 \\]\n\nNow, we have the cost of each item:\n- The shirt costs $30.\n- The wallet costs $90.\n- The food costs $30.\n\nTo find the total amount Mike spent, we add the costs of the shirt, the wallet, and the food:\n\\[ S + W + 30 = 30 + 90 + 30 = 150 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Mike spent that day on the shopping is:\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]",
