There are 2 farms nearby, each of which has 2 horses. There are 2 stables nearby which all have 5 horses each. While the blacksmith is crafting, a riding school reaches out and asks for as many horseshoes as possible for their own horses. The blacksmith promises to give them however many horseshoes he has left when he has finished his orders for the farms and stables. If each horseshoe needs 2kg of iron, how many horses will get new horseshoes at the riding school?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many horses will get new horseshoes at the riding school, we need to calculate the total amount of iron required for the farms and stables first, and then see how much iron is left for the riding school.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of horses at the farms and stables:\n- There are 2 farms, each with 2 horses, so the total number of horses at the farms is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n- There are 2 stables, each with 5 horses, so the total number of horses at the stables is \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\).\n- Therefore, the total number of horses at the farms and stables is \\(4 + 10 = 14\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of iron required for these horses.

        "To determine how many horses will get new horseshoes at the riding school, we need to calculate the total number of horseshoes the blacksmith will make for the farms and stables, and then see how much iron is left for the riding school.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of horses on the farms and stables:\n- Each farm has 2 horses, and there are 2 farms. So, the total number of horses on the farms is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ farms} \\times 2 \\text{ horses per farm} = 4 \\text{ horses}\n  \\]\n- Each stable has 5 horses, and there are 2 stables. So, the total number of horses on the stables is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ stables} \\times 5 \\text{ horses per stable} = 10 \\text{ horses}\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the total number of horses on the farms and stables is:\n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ horses} + 10 \\text{ horses} = 14 \\text{ horses}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of horseshoes required for these 14 horses. Since each horse needs 4 horseshoes, the total number of horseshoes needed is:\n\\[\n14 \\text{ horses} \\times 4 \\text{ horseshoes per horse} = 56 \\text{ horseshoes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how much iron is used for these 56 horseshoes. Since each horseshoe requires 2 kg of iron, the total amount of iron used is:\n\\[\n56 \\text{ horseshoes} \\times 2 \\text{ kg per horseshoe} = 112 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nThe blacksmith starts with 400 kg of iron. After using 112 kg for the farms and stables, the amount of iron left for the riding school is:\n\\[\n400 \\text{ kg} - 112 \\text{ kg} = 288 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we need to determine how many horses will get new horseshoes at the riding school. Since each horse needs 4 horseshoes and each horseshoe requires 2 kg of iron, each horse will use:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ horseshoes} \\times 2 \\text{ kg per horseshoe} = 8 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of horses that can belope new horseshoes at the riding school is:\n\\[\n\\frac{288 \\text{ kg}}{8 \\text{ kg per horse}} = 36 \\text{ horses}\n\\]\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]",

        "To determine how many horses will get new horseshoes at the riding school, we need to calculate the total number of horseshoes required for the farms and stables first, and then find out how many horseshoes are left from the initial 400kg of iron.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of horses on the farms and stables:\n- There are 2 farms, each with 2 horses. So, the total number of horses on the farms is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 2 = 4\n  \\]\n- There are 2 stables, each with 5 horses. So, the total number of horses on the stables is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 5 = 10\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the total number of horses on the farms and stables is:\n  \\[\n  4 + 10 = 14\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many horseshoes are required for these 14 horses. Since each horse needs 4 horseshoes, the total number of horseshoes needed is:\n\\[\n14 \\times 4 = 56\n\\]\n\nEach horseshoe requires 2kg of iron. So, the total amount of iron needed for 56 horseshoes is:\n\\[\n56 \\times 2 = 112 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nThe blacksmith starts with 400kg of iron. After using 112kg for the farms and stables, the amount of iron left is:\n\\[\n400 - 112 = 288 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nSince each horseshoe requires 2kg of iron, the number of horseshoes that can be made with the remaining 288kg of iron is:\n\\[\n\\frac{288}{2} = 144\n\\]\n\nEach horse needs 4 horseshoes, so the number of horses that can get new horseshoes at the riding school is:\n\\[\n\\frac{144}{4} = 36\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of horses that will get new horseshoes at the riding school is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]",
