        "To find the combined weight of John, Mary, and Jamison, we need to determine the weight of each individual step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Mary weighs 160 lbs. According to the problem, John weighs one-quarter times more than what Mary weighs. This means John's weight is Mary's weight plus one-quarter of Mary's weight. We can calculate John's weight as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{John's weight} = 160 + \\frac{1}{4} \\times 160 = 160 + 40 = 200 \\text{ lbs}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Mary weighs 20 lbs less than Jamison's weight. Therefore, Jamison's weight is Mary's weight plus 20 lbs. We can calculate Jamison's weight as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Jamison's weight} = 160 + 20 = 180 \\text{ lbs}\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the weight of each person, we can find the combined weight of John, Mary, and Jamison by adding their weights together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Combined weight} = \\text{John's weight} + \\text{Mary's weight} + \\text{Jamison's weight} = 200 + 160 + 180 = 540 \\text{ lbs}\n\\]\n\nThus, the combined weight of the three is \\boxed{540}.",

        "To determine the combined weight of John, Mary, and Jamison, we need to find the weight of each individual step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Mary weighs 160 lbs. According to the problem, Mary weighs 20 lbs less than Jamison's weight. Therefore, we can find Jamison's weight by adding 20 lbs to Mary's weight:\n\\[\n\\text{Jamison's weight} = \\text{Mary's weight} + 20 = 160 + 20 = 180 \\text{ lbs}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that John weighs one-quarter times more than what Mary weighs. This means John's weight is Mary's weight plus one-quarter of Mary's weight. We can calculate one-quarter of Mary's weight as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{One-quarter of Mary's weight} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 160 = 40 \\text{ lbs}\n\\]\nTherefore, John's weight is:\n\\[\n\\text{John's weight} = \\text{Mary's weight} + \\text{One-quarter of Mary's weight} = 160 + 40 = 200 \\text{ lbs}\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the weights of John, Mary, and Jamison, we can find the combined weight of the three by adding their weights together:\n\\[\n\\text{Combined weight} = \\text{John's weight} + \\text{Mary's weight} + \\text{Jamison's weight} = 200 + 160 + 180 = 540 \\text{ lbs}\n\\]\n\nThus, the combined weight of John, Mary, and Jamison is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{540}\n\\]",
