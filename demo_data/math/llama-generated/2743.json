        "To determine how many animals Cara's cat catches, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of animals Martha's cat catches.\n2. Use this total to find out how many animals Cara's cat catches.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of animals Martha's cat catches. Martha's cat catches 3 rats and 7 birds. Therefore, the total number of animals Martha's cat catches is:\n\\[ 3 + 7 = 10 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many animals Cara's cat catches. Cara's cat catches 3 less than five times as many animals as Martha's cat. First, we calculate five times the number of animals Martha's cat catches:\n\\[ 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\]\nThen, we subtract 3 from this result:\n\\[ 50 - 3 = 47 \\]\n\nSo, the number of animals Cara's cat catches is:\n\\[ \\boxed{47} \\]",
