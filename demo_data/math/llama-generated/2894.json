        "To determine how many people are wearing vertical stripes, we start by identifying the number of people wearing checkered shirts, which is given as 7. According to the problem, the number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times the number of people wearing checkered shirts. Therefore, we calculate the number of people wearing horizontal stripes as follows:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 7 = 28\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out the total number of people wearing either checkered shirts or horizontal stripes. This is the sum of the people wearing checkered shirts and the people wearing horizontal stripes:\n\n\\[\n7 + 28 = 35\n\\]\n\nSince the total number of people in the cafeteria is 40, the number of people wearing vertical stripes is the difference between the total number of people and the number of people wearing checkered shirts or horizontal stripes:\n\n\\[\n40 - 35 = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people wearing vertical stripes is \\boxed{5}.",
        "To determine how many people are wearing vertical stripes, we start by identifying the number of people wearing each type of shirt.\n\nFirst, we know that 7 out of the 40 people are wearing checkered shirts.

Therefore, \\( C = 7 \\).\n\nNext, we are given that the number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times the number of people wearing checkered shirts.

Let's denote the number of people wearing vertical stripes as \\( V \\). The total number of people in the cafeteria is the sum of the people wearing checkered shirts, horizontal stripes, and vertical stripes. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ C + H + V = 40 \\]\n\nSubstituting the values of \\( C \\) and \\( H \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 7 + 28 + V = 40 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we subtract the sum of \\( C \\) and \\( H \\) from 40:\n\\[ V = 40 - (7 + 28) = 40 - 35 = 5 \\]\n\nThus, the number of people wearing vertical stripes is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
