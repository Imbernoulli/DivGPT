Convert the total servings into single pancakes.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings of pancakes needed for the girls.**\n\nWillow's daughter and her 3 friends make a total of 4 girls. Each girl wants a serving and a half of pancakes. Therefore, we multiply the number of girls by the number of servings each girl wants:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ girls} \\times 1.5 \\text{ servings/girl} = 6 \\text{ servings} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of servings of pancakes needed for Willow's son.**\n\nWillow's son wants 3 servings of pancakes. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ servings} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the total servings of pancakes needed for the girls and the son.**\n\nWe add the servings needed for the girls and the servings needed for the son:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ servings} + 3 \\text{ servings} = 9 \\text{ servings} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Convert the total servings into single pancakes.**\n\nWillow's recipe makes 1 serving of 4 pancakes. Therefore, we multiply the total number of servings by the number of pancakes per serving:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ servings} \\times 4 \\text{ pancakes/serving} = 36 \\text{ pancakes} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of single pancakes Willow will make for the girls and her son is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
