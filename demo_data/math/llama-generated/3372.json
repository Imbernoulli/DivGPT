        "To determine how much money Susan will spend on food, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of servings needed.\n2. Determine how many batches of the recipe are required.\n3. Calculate the total number of potatoes and teaspoons of salt needed.\n4. Compute the total cost of the potatoes and salt.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings needed.**\n\nSusan is planning on having 30 guests. Since each guest will have one serving, the total number of servings needed is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ servings} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many batches of the recipe are required.**\n\nEach batch of the recipe makes 2 servings. Therefore, the number of batches required is:\n\\[ \\frac{30 \\text{ servings}}{2 \\text{ servings per batch}} = 15 \\text{ batches} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of potatoes and teaspoons of salt needed.**\n\nEach batch requires 4 potatoes. So, the total number of potatoes needed is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ batches} \\times 4 \\text{ potatoes per batch} = 60 \\text{ potatoes} \\]\n\nEach batch requires 1 teaspoon of salt. So, the total number of teaspoons of salt needed is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ batches} \\times 1 \\text{ teaspoon per batch} = 15 \\text{ teaspoons} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Compute the total cost of the potatoes and salt.**\n\nEach potato costs $0.10. Therefore, the total cost of the potatoes is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ potatoes} \\times \\$0.10 \\text{ per potato} = \\$6 \\]\n\nEach container of salt contains 5 teaspoons. So, the number of containers of salt needed is:\n\\[ \\frac{15 \\text{ teaspoons}}{5 \\text{ teaspoons per container}} = 3 \\text{ containers} \\]\n\nEach container of salt costs $2. Therefore, the total cost of the salt is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ containers} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per container} = \\$6 \\]\n\nAdding the cost of the potatoes and the cost of the salt gives the total cost of the food:\n\\[ \\$6 + \\$6 = \\$12 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Susan will spend on food is:\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]",
