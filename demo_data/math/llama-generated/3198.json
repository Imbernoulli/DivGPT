        "To determine the number of barnyard owls making the hoot sounds, we start by finding the total number of hoots per minute heard. According to the problem, the number of hoots per minute heard is 5 less than 20. We can express this as:\n\n\\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \\]\n\nSo, there are 15 hoots per minute heard. Since each barnyard owl makes 5 hoot sounds per minute, we can find the number of owls by dividing the total number of hoots per minute by the number of hoots each owl makes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{15}{5} = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of barnyard owls making the noise is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

To find out how many owls are making these 15 hoots, we divide the total number of hoots by the number of hoots each owl makes:\n\\[ 15 \\div 5 = 3 \\]\nThis means that 3 owls are making the hoot sounds.\n\nTherefore, the number of barnyard owls would be coming from \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
