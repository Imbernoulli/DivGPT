        "To determine how many pages Jim reads per week after increasing his reading speed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Jim's initial reading time per week:**\n   Jim reads 600 pages per week at a rate of 40 pages per hour. Therefore, the time he spends reading each week is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial reading time} = \\frac{600 \\text{ pages}}{40 \\text{ pages/hour}} = 15 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Jim's new reading speed:**\n   Jim increases his reading speed to 150% of its former speed. Since his former reading speed is 40 pages per hour, his new reading speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New reading speed} = 40 \\text{ pages/hour} \\times 1.5 = 60 \\text{ pages/hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Jim's new reading time per week:**\n   Jim now reads 4 hours less per week than he did initially. Therefore, his new reading time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New reading time} = 15 \\text{ hours} - 4 \\text{ hours} = 11 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the total number of pages Jim reads per week now:**\n   With his new reading speed and new reading time, the total number of pages he reads per week is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New total pages} = 60 \\text{ pages/hour} \\times 11 \\text{ hours} = 660 \\text{ pages}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of pages Jim reads a week now is \\(\\boxed{660}\\).",

Therefore, his new reading time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New reading time} = 15 \\text{ hours} - 4 \\text{ hours} = 11 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the new total number of pages Jim reads per week:**\n   Using his new reading speed and new reading time, the total number of pages he reads per week is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New total pages} = 60 \\text{ pages/hour} \\times 11 \\text{ hours} = 660 \\text{ pages}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of pages Jim reads per week now is \\(\\boxed{660}\\).",
        "To determine how many pages Jim reads per week after increasing his reading speed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Jim's original reading time per week:**\n   Jim reads 600 pages per week at a rate of 40 pages per hour.

        "To determine how many pages Jim reads per week after increasing his reading speed, we start by calculating his initial reading time per week.\n\nFirst, we know Jim's initial reading rate is 40 pages per hour and he reads 600 pages per week. The initial time he spends reading per week is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Initial reading time per week} = \\frac{600 \\text{ pages}}{40 \\text{ pages per hour}} = 15 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, Jim increases his reading speed to 150% of his former speed. Therefore, his new reading speed is:\n\\[\n\\text{New reading speed} = 40 \\text{ pages per hour} \\times 1.5 = 60 \\text{ pages per hour}\n\\]\n\nWith his new reading speed, he reads 4 hours less per week. So, his new reading time per week is:\n\\[\n\\text{New reading time per week} = 15 \\text{ hours} - 4 \\text{ hours} = 11 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of pages he reads per week with his new reading speed and time:\n\\[\n\\text{New number of pages per week} = 60 \\text{ pages per hour} \\times 11 \\text{ hours} = 660 \\text{ pages}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of pages Jim reads per week now is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{660}\n\\]"
