        "To determine how much Jenine needs to spend on more pencils, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of times Jenine needs to sharpen a pencil for 105 hours of writing.\n2. Determine how many pencils she will use and how many more pencils she needs to buy.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the additional pencils.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of times Jenine needs to sharpen a pencil.**\n\nJenine sharpens a pencil every 1.5 hours. Therefore, the total number of times she needs to sharpen a pencil for 105 hours is:\n\\[\n\\frac{105}{1.5} = 70\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many pencils she will use and how many more pencils she needs to buy.**\n\nEach pencil can be sharpened 5 times before it runs out. Therefore, the number of pencils Jenine will use is:\n\\[\n\\frac{70}{5} = 14\n\\]\n\nJenine already has 10 pencils. Therefore, the number of additional pencils she needs to buy is:\n\\[\n14 - 10 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the additional pencils.**\n\nEach new pencil costs $2. Therefore, the total cost of 4 additional pencils is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 2 = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, Jenine needs to spend \\(\\boxed{8}\\) dollars on more pencils to be able to write for 105 hours.",
        "To determine how many more pencils Jenine needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of times she will need to sharpen a pencil over the 105 hours of writing.\n\nSince Jenine needs to sharpen a pencil for every 1.5 hours of use, we can find the total number of sharpenings required by dividing 105 by 1.5:\n\\[\n\\frac{105}{1.5} = 70\n\\]\nSo, Jenine will need to sharpen her pencils 70 times in total.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many pencils Jenine will use. Since each pencil can be sharpened 5 times before it runs out, we can find the total number of pencils needed by dividing the total number of sharpenings by 5:\n\\[\n\\frac{70}{5} = 14\n\\]\nSo, Jenine will need 14 pencils in total.\n\nJenine already has 10 pencils, so we need to find out how many more pencils she needs to buy by subtracting the number of pencils she already has from the total number of pencils needed:\n\\[\n14 - 10 = 4\n\\]\nSo, Jenine needs to buy 4 more pencils.\n\nSince each new pencil costs $2, the total cost of the pencils she needs to buy is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 2 = 8\n\\]\nTherefore, Jenine needs to spend \\(\\boxed{8}\\) dollars on more pencils.",

Since she needs to sharpen a pencil for every 1.5 hours of use, we divide 105 by 1.5:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{105}{1.5} = 70\n\\]\n\nSo, Jenine needs to sharpen pencils 70 times.\n\nNext, we determine how many pencils Jenine will use. Since each pencil can be sharpened 5 times, we divide the total number of sharpenings by 5:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{70}{5} = 14\n\\]\n\nSo, Jenine needs 14 pencils in total.\n\nSince Jenine already has 10 pencils, we need to find out how many more pencils she needs:\n\n\\[\n14 - 10 = 4\n\\]\n\nSo, Jenine needs 4 more pencils.
