Weather fluctuations in this area mean that each tree's rings are in groups of two fat rings and four thin rings. If Billy counts 70 ring groups in the first tree and 40 ring groups in the second tree, how much older is the first tree? (Trees grow 1 ring per year.)<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how much older the first tree is compared to the second tree, we need to calculate the total number of rings in each tree and then find the difference between these two totals.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of rings in the first tree.

        "To determine how much older the first tree is compared to the second tree, we need to calculate the total number of rings in each tree and then find the difference between these two totals.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of rings in the first tree. Each ring group consists of 2 fat rings and 4 thin rings, so each ring group has a total of \\(2 + 4 = 6\\) rings. Since there are 70 ring groups in the first tree, the total number of rings in the first tree is:\n\\[\n70 \\times 6 = 420\n\\]\nThis means the first tree is 420 years old.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of rings in the second tree. Each ring group consists of 2 fat rings and 4 thin rings, so each ring group has a total of \\(2 + 4 = 6\\) rings. Since there are 40 ring groups in the second tree, the total number of rings in the second tree is:\n\\[\n40 \\times 6 = 240\n\\]\nThis means the second tree is 240 years old.\n\nTo find out how much older the first tree is compared to the second tree, we subtract the age of the second tree from the age of the first tree:\n\\[\n420 - 240 = 180\n\\]\nTherefore, the first tree is \\(\\boxed{180}\\) years older than the second tree.",
