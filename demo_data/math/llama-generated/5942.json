One half of the geese broke off from the formation, flew toward the earth, and landed in some trees.  Then, 4 geese flew up, out of the trees, and joined those already flying in the air to make a new V formation in the sky.  If the final number of geese flying in the V formation was 12, how many geese were in the first formation Albert noticed in the sky?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
