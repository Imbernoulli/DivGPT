        "To determine how many tickets Amanda needs to sell on the third day, we start by calculating the total number of tickets she has sold so far over the first two days.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of tickets Amanda sold on the first day. She sold 4 tickets to each of her 5 friends:\n\\[ 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ tickets} \\]\n\nNext, we know that on the second day she sold 32 tickets. So, the total number of tickets sold over the first two days is:\n\\[ 20 + 32 = 52 \\text{ tickets} \\]\n\nAmanda's goal is to sell 80 tickets in total. To find out how many more tickets she needs to sell on the third day, we subtract the number of tickets she has already sold from her goal:\n\\[ 80 - 52 = 28 \\text{ tickets} \\]\n\nTherefore, Amanda needs to sell \\(\\boxed{28}\\) tickets on the third day to meet her goal.",
