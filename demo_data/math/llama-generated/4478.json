        "To determine the total cost Kevin has to pay for all the items, including the sales tax, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the T-shirts.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the sweaters.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the jackets, including the discount.\n4. Sum the total costs of the T-shirts, sweaters, and jackets.\n5. Calculate the sales tax on the total cost.\n6. Add the sales tax to the total cost to get the final amount Kevin has to pay.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. The cost of six T-shirts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 8 = 48\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $48.\n\n2. The cost of four sweaters:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 18 = 72\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the sweaters is $72.\n\n3. The cost of five jackets with a 10% discount:\n   The original price of one jacket is $80. A 10% discount on $80 is:\n   \\[\n   80 \\times 0.10 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, the discount on each jacket is $8. The price of one jacket after the discount is:\n   \\[\n   80 - 8 = 72\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total cost of five jackets is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 72 = 360\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the jackets is $360.\n\n4. The sum of the total costs of the T-shirts, sweaters, and jackets:\n   \\[\n   48 + 72 + 360 = 480\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of all the items before tax is $480.\n\n5. The sales tax on the total cost:\n   The sales tax rate is 5%. The sales tax on $480 is:\n   \\[\n   480 \\times 0.05 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, the sales tax is $24.\n\n6. The final amount Kevin has to pay:\n   \\[\n   480 + 24 = 504\n   \\]\n   So, the final amount Kevin has to pay is \\(\\boxed{504}\\).",
