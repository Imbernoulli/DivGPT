        "To determine the total cost of the tickets Ashley and her family bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of one adult ticket.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the adult tickets.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the children's tickets.\n4. Add the total cost of the adult tickets and the total cost of the children's tickets.\n5. Subtract the $2 discount for buying more than 3 tickets.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of one adult ticket. We know that adult tickets cost $3.25 more than children's tickets. Since children's tickets cost $4.25, we can find the cost of one adult ticket as follows:\n\\[ 4.25 + 3.25 = 7.50 \\]\nSo, the cost of one adult ticket is $7.50.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the adult tickets. They bought 2 adult tickets, so we multiply the cost of one adult ticket by 2:\n\\[ 7.50 \\times 2 = 15.00 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the adult tickets is $15.00.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the children's tickets. They bought 4 children's tickets, so we multiply the cost of one children's ticket by 4:\n\\[ 4.25 \\times 4 = 17.00 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the children's tickets is $17.00.\n\nNext, let's add the total cost of the adult tickets and the total cost of the children's tickets:\n\\[ 15.00 + 17.00 = 32.00 \\]\nSo, the total cost before the discount is $32.00.\n\nFinally, let's subtract the $2 discount for buying more than 3 tickets:\n\\[ 32.00 - 2.00 = 30.00 \\]\nSo, the total amount they spent is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

They bought 2 adult tickets, so we multiply the cost of one adult ticket by 2:\n\\[\n2 \\times 7.50 = 15.00\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the adult tickets is $15.00.\n\nThen, we calculate the total cost of the children's tickets. They bought 4 children's tickets, so we multiply the cost of one children's ticket by 4:\n\\[\n4 \\times 4.25 = 17.00\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the children's tickets is $17.00.\n\nNow, we add the total costs of the adult and children's tickets:\n\\[\n15.00 + 17.00 = 32.00\n\\]\nSo, the total cost before the discount is $32.00.\n\nSince they bought more than 3 tickets, they get a $2 discount. We subtract $2 from the total cost:\n\\[\n32.00 - 2.00 = 30.00\n\\]\nSo, the total amount they spent is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

Calculate the total cost of the children's tickets.\n4. Add the total costs of the adult and children's tickets.\n5. Apply the $2 discount for buying more than 3 tickets.\n\nLet's start with the cost of one adult ticket. The adult ticket costs $3.25 more than a children's ticket. Since a children's ticket costs $4.25, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of one adult ticket} = 4.25 + 3.25 = 7.50 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the adult tickets. They bought two adult tickets, so:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost of adult tickets} = 2 \\times 7.50 = 15.00 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of the children's tickets. They bought four children's tickets, so:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost of children's tickets} = 4 \\times 4.25 = 17.00 \\]\n\nNext, we add the total costs of the adult and children's tickets:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost before discount} = 15.00 + 17.00 = 32.00 \\]\n\nSince they bought more than 3 tickets, they get a $2 discount. Therefore, we subtract $2 from the total cost:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost after discount} = 32.00 - 2.00 = 30.00 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount they spent is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",

Apply the discount for buying more than 3 tickets.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of one adult ticket.**\n\nThe cost of a children's ticket is $4.25. Since adult tickets cost $3.25 more, we add $3.25 to $4.25:\n\\[ 4.25 + 3.25 = 7.50 \\]\nSo, the cost of one adult ticket is $7.50.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the adult tickets.**\n\nThey bought two adult tickets.

Therefore, we multiply the cost of one children's ticket by 4:\n\\[ 4.25 \\times 4 = 17.00 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the children's tickets is $17.00.\n\n**Step 4: Add the total costs of the adult and children's tickets.**\n\nWe add the total cost of the adult tickets to the total cost of the children's tickets:\n\\[ 15.00 + 17.00 = 32.00 \\]\nSo, the total cost before the discount is $32.00.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the discount for buying more than 3 tickets.**\n\nSince they bought 6 tickets (2 adult + 4 children), they qualify for a $2 discount. Therefore, we subtract $2 from the total cost:\n\\[ 32.00 - 2.00 = 30.00 \\]\nSo, the total amount they spent is $30.00.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",

Apply the $2 discount for buying more than 3 tickets.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of one adult ticket.**\n\nThe cost of a children's ticket is $4.25. Since adult tickets cost $3.25 more than children's tickets, we add $3.25 to $4.25:\n\\[ 4.25 + 3.25 = 7.50 \\]\nSo, the cost of one adult ticket is $7.50.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the adult tickets.**\n\nThey bought 2 adult tickets. Therefore, the total cost for the adult tickets is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 7.50 = 15.00 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the children's tickets.**\n\nThey bought 4 children's tickets. Therefore, the total cost for the children's tickets is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 4.25 = 17.00 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Add the total costs of the adult and children's tickets.**\n\nThe total cost for the adult tickets is $15.00, and the total cost for the children's tickets is $17.00. Adding these together gives:\n\\[ 15.00 + 17.00 = 32.00 \\]\n\n**Step 5: Apply the $2 discount for buying more than 3 tickets.**\n\nSince they bought a total of 6 tickets (2 adult tickets + 4 children's tickets), which is more than 3 tickets, they get a $2 discount. Therefore, we subtract $2 from the total cost:\n\\[ 32.00 - 2.00 = 30.00 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount they spent is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",

Since a child's ticket costs $4.25, we have:\n\\[ 4.25 + 3.25 = 7.50 \\]\nSo, the cost of an adult ticket is $7.50.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the adult tickets. They bought two adult tickets, so:\n\\[ 2 \\times 7.50 = 15.00 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the adult tickets is $15.00.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the children's tickets. They bought four children's tickets, so:\n\\[ 4 \\times 4.25 = 17.00 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the children's tickets is $17.00.\n\nNext, let's add the total costs of the adult and children's tickets:\n\\[ 15.00 + 17.00 = 32.00 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the tickets before the discount is $32.00.\n\nFinally, let's subtract the discount for buying more than 3 tickets. The discount is $2, so:\n\\[ 32.00 - 2.00 = 30.00 \\]\nSo, the total amount they spent is $30.00.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",

Apply the $2 discount for buying more than 3 tickets.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of an adult ticket.\n   The cost of a children's ticket is $4.25. Since adult tickets cost $3.25 more, we add these amounts together:\n   \\[\n   4.25 + 3.25 = 7.50\n   \\]\n   So, the cost of an adult ticket is $7.50.\n\n2. Calculate the total cost of the adult tickets.\n   They bought 2 adult tickets, so we multiply the cost of one adult ticket by 2:\n   \\[\n   7.50 \\times 2 = 15.00\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the adult tickets is $15.00.\n\n3. Calculate the total cost of the children's tickets.\n   They bought 4 children's tickets, so we multiply the cost of one children's ticket by 4:\n   \\[\n   4.25 \\times 4 = 17.00\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the children's tickets is $17.00.\n\n4. Add the total costs of the adult and children's tickets.\n   We add the total cost of the adult tickets to the total cost of the children's tickets:\n   \\[\n   15.00 + 17.00 = 32.00\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost before the discount is $32.00.\n\n5. Apply the $2 discount for buying more than 3 tickets.\n   Since they bought 6 tickets (2 adult tickets + 4 children's tickets), they qualify for the $2 discount. We subtract $2 from the total cost:\n   \\[\n   32.00 - 2.00 = 30.00\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount they spent is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

Since an adult ticket costs $3.25 more, we add $3.25 to $4.25:\n\\[ 4.25 + 3.25 = 7.50 \\]\nSo, the cost of an adult ticket is $7.50.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the adult tickets.**\nThey bought 2 adult tickets, so we multiply the cost of one adult ticket by 2:\n\\[ 7.50 \\times 2 = 15.00 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the adult tickets is $15.00.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the children's tickets.**\nThey bought 4 children's tickets, so we multiply the cost of one children's ticket by 4:\n\\[ 4.25 \\times 4 = 17.00 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the children's tickets is $17.00.\n\n**Step 4: Add the total costs of the adult and children's tickets.**\nWe add the total cost of the adult tickets to the total cost of the children's tickets:\n\\[ 15.00 + 17.00 = 32.00 \\]\nSo, the total cost before the discount is $32.00.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the $2 discount.**\nSince they bought more than 3 tickets, they get a $2 discount. We subtract $2 from the total cost:\n\\[ 32.00 - 2.00 = 30.00 \\]\nSo, the total amount they spent is $30.00.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

They bought four children's tickets, so we multiply the cost of one children's ticket by 4:\n\\[\n4.25 \\times 4 = 17.00\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the children's tickets is $17.00.\n\nNext, we add the total costs of the adult and children's tickets together:\n\\[\n15.00 + 17.00 = 32.00\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of all the tickets before the discount is $32.00.\n\nFinally, we subtract the $2 discount from the total cost:\n\\[\n32.00 - 2.00 = 30.00\n\\]\nSo, the total amount they spent is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
