        "To determine the number of Black Copper Marans (BCM) hens on the farm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of Black Copper Marans.\n2. Determine how many of these Black Copper Marans are hens.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of Black Copper Marans.**\n\nThe farm has 100 chickens, and 20 percent of them are Black Copper Marans. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \\times 100 = 20 \\]\nSo, there are 20 Black Copper Marans.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many of these Black Copper Marans are hens.**\n\n80 percent of the Black Copper Marans are hens. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[ 80\\% \\text{ of } 20 = 0.80 \\times 20 = 16 \\]\nSo, there are 16 Black Copper Marans hens.\n\nThe number of BCM hens is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
