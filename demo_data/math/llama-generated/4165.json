Determine how many emails remain in the inbox after moving emails to the trash and the work folder.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Steve has 400 new emails in his inbox. He moves half of them to the trash.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of emails moved to the trash} = \\frac{400}{2} = 200\n   \\]\n   So, after moving emails to the trash, the number of emails left is:\n   \\[\n   400 - 200 = 200\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, Steve moves 40 percent of the remaining emails to his work folder.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of emails moved to the work folder} = 0.40 \\times 200 = 80\n   \\]\n   So, after moving emails to the work folder, the number of emails left is:\n   \\[\n   200 - 80 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of emails left in the inbox is \\boxed{120}.",
        "To determine how many emails are left in Steve's inbox, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of emails moved to the trash:**\n   Steve moves half of his 400 emails to the trash.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400}{2} = 200\n   \\]\n   So, 200 emails are moved to the trash.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of emails remaining after moving some to the trash:**\n   Subtract the number of emails moved to the trash from the original total.\n   \\[\n   400 - 200 = 200\n   \\]\n   So, there are 200 emails remaining.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of emails moved to the work folder:**\n   Steve moves 40 percent of the remaining emails to his work folder.\n   \\[\n   0.40 \\times 200 = 80\n   \\]\n   So, 80 emails are moved to the work folder.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of emails left in the inbox:**\n   Subtract the number of emails moved to the work folder from the remaining emails.\n   \\[\n   200 - 80 = 120\n   \\]\n   So, there are 120 emails left in the inbox.\n\nThus, the final number of emails left in Steve's inbox is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
