        "To determine how many ounces of milk James has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert gallons to ounces:**\n   James starts with 3 gallons of milk. Since there are 128 ounces in a gallon, we calculate the total number of ounces in 3 gallons:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ gallons} \\times 128 \\text{ ounces/gallon} = 384 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the amount eaten:**\n   James drank 13 ounces of the milk. We subtract this amount from the total number of ounces he initially had:\n   \\[\n   384 \\text{ ounces} - 13 \\text{ ounces} = 371 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ounces of milk James has left is \\(\\boxed{371}\\).",
