She placed the cakes in boxes, and then walked them out to her car.  But she had forgotten her keys.  So, she placed the boxes of cakes in one stack on the hood of her car, and then she ran back into the house to get her keys.  But before she returned, a black crow came, landed on the stack of cakes, and knocked over half of the stack.  When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed.  How many cakes were destroyed?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many cakes were destroyed, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of cakes:**\n   Chastity made 12 angel food cakes.\n\n2. **Cakes knocked over by the crow:**\n   The crow knocked over half of the stack of cakes. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, 6 cakes were knocked over.\n\n3. **Cakes picked up by Chastity:**\n   Chastity picked up half of the fallen cakes.

Since 3 cakes were picked up out of the 6 fallen cakes, the number of cakes destroyed is:\n   \\[\n   6 - 3 = 3\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of cakes destroyed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

        "To determine how many cakes were destroyed, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Number of Cakes**: Chastity made 12 angel food cakes.\n2. **Cakesきっ Over by the Crow**: The crow knocked over half of the stack of cakes. Since the stack originally had 12 cakes, half of the stack would be:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, 6 cakes were knocked over.\n3. **Cakes Picked Up by Chastity**: Chastity picked up half of the fallen cakes. Since 6 cakes were knocked over, half of the fallen cakes would be:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n   So, Chastity picked up 3 cakes.\n4. **Cakes destroyed**: The rest of the cakes that were knocked over were destroyed. Since 6 cakes were knocked over and Chastity picked up 3 of them, the number of cakes destroyed is:\n   \\[\n   6 - 3 = 3\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cakes destroyed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
