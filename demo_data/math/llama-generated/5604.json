        "Let's start by determining how many cookies Jasmine brought. Since Jasmine brought 5 fewer cookies than Mona, we can calculate the number of cookies Jasmine brought as follows:\n\\[\n20 - 5 = 15\n\\]\nSo, Jasmine brought 15 cookies.\n\nNext, let's determine how many cookies Rachel brought. Since Rachel brought 10 more cookies than Jasmine, we can calculate the number of cookies Rachel brought as follows:\n\\[\n15 + 10 = 25\n\\]\nSo, Rachel brought 25 cookies.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of cookies brought by Mona, Jasmine, and Rachel. We do this by adding the number of cookies each person brought:\n\\[\n20 + 15 + 25 = 60\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of cookies brought by Mona, Jasmine, and Rachel is \\boxed{60}.",

Add the number of cookies brought by Mona, Jasmine, and Rachel together.\n\nFirst, we know that Mona brought 20 cookies.\n\nNext, we calculate how many cookies Jasmine brought. Jasmine brought 5 fewer cookies than Mona:\n\\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \\]\nSo, Jasmine brought 15 cookies.\n\nThen, we calculate how many cookies Rachel brought. Rachel brought 10 more cookies than Jasmine:\n\\[ 15 + 10 = 25 \\]\nSo, Rachel brought 25 cookies.\n\nFinally, we add the number of cookies brought by Mona, Jasmine, and Rachel together:\n\\[ 20 + 15 + 25 = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cookies altogether that Mona, Jasmine, and Rachel brought to share in class is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
