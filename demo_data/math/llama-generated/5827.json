In the first week of the dry season, the tree shed 2/5 of the leaves. In the second week, it shed 40% of the remaining leaves.  In the third week, the tree shed 3/4 times as many leaves as it shed on the second week. Calculate the number of leaves the tree hadn't shed by the third week.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
