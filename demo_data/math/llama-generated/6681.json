        "Let's define the number of Chevys Jim has as \\( C \\). According to the problem, Jim has 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys. So, if we let the number of Fords be \\( F \\), then the number of Buicks is \\( 4F \\) and the number of Fords is \\( 2C + 3 \\). Therefore, we can express the number of Buicks in terms of \\( C \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ B = 4F = 4(2C + 3) = 8C + 12 \\]\n\nThe total number of model cars Jim has is 301, which is the sum of the number of Buicks, Fords, and Chevys. So we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ B + F + C = 301 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( B \\) and \\( F \\) in terms of \\( C \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ (8C + 12) + (2C + 3) + C = 301 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ 11C + 15 = 301 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( C \\), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 11C = 286 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 11:\n\n\\[ C = 26 \\]\n\nNow that we know the number of Chevys is 26, we can find the number of Fords:\n\n\\[ F = 2C + 3 = 2(26) + 3 = 52 + 3 = 55 \\]\n\nAnd the number of Buicks is:\n\n\\[ B = 4F = 4(55) = 220 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of Buicks Jim has is \\(\\boxed{220}\\).",
        "To determine the number of Buicks Jim has, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables as follows:\n\n- \\( C \\) represents the number of Chevys.\n- \\( F \\) represents the number of Fords.\n- \\( B \\) represents the number of Buicks.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following relationships:\n\n1. Jim has 301 models in total:\n   \\[\n   C + F + B = 301\n   \\]\n\n2. Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords:\n   \\[\n   B = 4F\n   \\]\n\n3. Jim has 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys:\n   \\[\n   F = 2C + 3\n   \\]\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for \\( B \\) and \\( F \\) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1. First, substitute \\( F = 2C + 3 \\) into \\( B = 4F \\):\n\\[\nB = 4(2C + 3) = 8C + 12\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( F = 2C + 3 \\) and \\( B = 8C + 12 \\) into the total Definitions equation \\( C + F + B = 301 \\):\n\\[\nC + (2C + 3) + (8C + 12) = 301\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\nC + 2C + 8C + 3 + 12 = 301\n\\]\n\\[\n11C + 15 = 301\n\\]\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( C \\):\n\\[\n11C = 286\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 11 to solve for \\( C \\):\n\\[\nC = 26\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\( C = 26 \\), we can find \\( F \\) using the equation \\( F = 2C + 3 \\):\n\\[\nF = 2(26) + 3 = 52 + 3 = 55\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find \\( B \\) using the equation \\( B = 4F \\):\n\\[\nB = 4(55) = 220\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of Buicks Jim has is \\(\\boxed{220}\\)."
