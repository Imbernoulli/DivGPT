        "To determine how many new boxes of markers Mr. Smith bought, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of markers Mr. Smith had.\n2. Identify the total number of markers Mr. Smith has after buying new boxes.\n3. Determine how many markers were added by calculating the difference between the total number of markers and the initial number of markers.\n4. Divide the number of added markers by the number of markers per box to find out how many boxes were bought.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The initial number of markers Mr. Smith had is 32.\n2. The total number of markers Mr. Smith has now is 86.\n3. The number of markers added is \\(86 - 32 = 54\\).\n4. Since each box contains 9 markers, the number of boxes bought is \\(54 \\div 9 = 6\\).\n\nTherefore, Mr. Smith bought \\(\\boxed{6}\\) new boxes of markers.",
        "To determine how many new boxes of markers Mr. Smith bought, we start by identifying the initial number of markers and the final number of markers. Mr. Smith initially had 32 markers and now has 86 markers.

        "To determine how many new boxes of markers Mr. Smith bought, we start by identifying the initial number of markers and the total number of markers after the purchase.
