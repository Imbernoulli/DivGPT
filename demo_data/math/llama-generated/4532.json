Since there are 3 days he bakes apple pies and he bakes 12 pies per day, the total number of apple pies he bakes in a week is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ days} \\times 12 \\text{ pies/day} = 36 \\text{ apple pies} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of cherry pies Steve bakes in a week. Steve bakes cherry pies on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Since there are 2 days he bakes cherry pies and he bakes 12 pies per day, the total number of cherry pies he bakes in a week is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ days} \\times 12 \\text{ pies/day} = 24 \\text{ cherry pies} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more apple pies Steve bakes than cherry pies. We do this by subtracting the total number of cherry pies from the total number of apple pies:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ apple pies} - 24 \\text{ cherry pies} = 12 \\text{ more apple pies} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of more apple pies Steve bakes than cherry pies in one week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]",

He bakes cherry pies on Tuesdays and Thursdays. There are 2 days in a week when he bakes cherry pies.\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of apple pies baked in one week. Since he bakes 12 pies per day, and he bakes apple pies for 3 days, the total number of apple pies baked in one week is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ pies/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 36 \\text{ pies} \\]\n\nNext, let's determine the total number of cherry pies baked in one week.
