        "To determine how much money Regina would earn if she sold all the animals on her farm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pigs Regina has.\n2. Determine the total earnings from selling the cows.\n3. Determine the total earnings from selling the pigs.\n4. Add the earnings from the cows and the pigs to get the total amount of money earned.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of pigs Regina has. According to the problem, she has four times more pigs than cows. Since she has 20 cows, the number of pigs is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 20 = 80\n\\]\nSo, Regina has 80 pigs.\n\nNext, we calculate the total earnings from selling the cows. Since each cow earns her $800, the total earnings from the cows are:\n\\[\n20 \\times 800 = 16000\n\\]\nSo, Regina earns $16,000 from selling the cows.\n\nThen, we calculate the total earnings from selling the pigs. Since each pig earns her $400, the total earnings from the pigs are:\n\\[\n80 \\times 400 = 32000\n\\]\nSo, Regina earns $32,000 from selling the pigs.\n\nFinally, we add the earnings from the cows and the pigs to get the total amount of money earned:\n\\[\n16000 + 32000 = 48000\n\\]\nSo, Regina would earn \\(\\boxed{48000}\\) dollars if she would sell all the animals from the farm.",

Add the earnings from the cows and the pigs to get the total earnings.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of pigs Regina has. She has four times more pigs than cows. Since she has 20 cows, we can find the number of pigs by multiplying 20 by 4:\n\\[\n4 \\times 20 = 80\n\\]\nSo, Regina has 80 pigs.\n\nNext, we determine the total earnings from selling the cows. Each cow earns $800, and Regina has 20 cows. Therefore, the total earnings from the cows are:\n\\[\n20 \\times 800 = 16000\n\\]\nSo, Regina earns $16,000 from selling the cows.\n\nThen, we determine the total earnings from selling the pigs. Each pig earns $400, and Regina has 80 pigs. Therefore, the total earnings from the pigs are:\n\\[\n80 \\times 400 = 32000\n\\]\nSo, Regina earns $32,000 from selling the pigs.\n\nFinally, we add the earnings from the cows and the pigs to get the total earnings:\n\\[\n16000 + 32000 = 48000\n\\]\nSo, Regina would earn \\(\\boxed{48000}\\) dollars if she would sell all the animals from the farm.",

Since each pig earns $400, the total earnings from the pigs is:\n\\[ 80 \\times 400 = 32000 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total earnings from selling the cows. Since each cow earns $800, the total earnings from the cows is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 800 = 16000 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the earnings from the pigs and the cows to get the total amount of money earned:\n\\[ 32000 + 16000 = 48000 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Regina would earn if she sold all the animals from the farm is:\n\\[ \\boxed{48000} \\]",

Determine the total earnings from selling the cows.\n3. Determine the total earnings from selling the pigs.\n4. Add the earnings from the cows and the pigs to find the total earnings.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pigs Regina has. According to the problem, Regina has four times more pigs than cows. Since she has 20 cows, we can find the number of pigs by multiplying the number of cows by 4:\n\\[\n4 \\times 20 = 80\n\\]\nSo, Regina has 80 pigs.\n\nNext, we need to determine the total earnings from selling the cows. Regina earns $800 for each cow. Since she has 20 cows, we can find the total earnings from the cows by multiplying the number of cows by the price per cow:\n\\[\n20 \\times 800 = 16000\n\\]\nSo, the total earnings from the cows are $16,000.\n\nNow, we need to determine the total earnings from selling the pigs. Regina earns $400 for each pig. Since she has 80 pigs, we can find the total earnings from the pigs by multiplying the number of pigs by the price per pig:\n\\[\n80 \\times 400 = 32000\n\\]\nSo, the total earnings from the pigs are $32,000.\n\nFinally, we add the earnings from the cows and the pigs to find the total earnings:\n\\[\n16000 + 32000 = 48000\n\\]\nSo, the total amount of money Regina would earn if she sold all the animals from the farm is \\boxed{48000}.",
