        "To determine how much John pays for music in a year, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of songs John buys in a month:**\n   - John buys 20 hours of music each month.\n   - The average length of a song is 3 minutes.\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 20 hours is equivalent to \\(20 \\times 60 = 1200\\) minutes.\n   - Therefore, the total number of songs John buys in a month is \\(1200 \\div 3 = 400\\) songs.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of songs John buys in a year:**\n   - Since John buys 400 songs each month, in a year (which has 12 months) he buys \\(400 \\times 12 = 4800\\) songs.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the songs John buys in a year:**\n   - Each song costs $0.50.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for 4800 songs is \\(4800 \\times 0.50 = 2400\\) dollars.\n\nSo, the total amount John pays for music in a year is \\(\\boxed{2400}\\).",
        "To determine how much John pays for music in a year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of hours John buys in a year:**\n   John buys 20 hours of music per month.

Therefore, the number of songs John buys in a month is:\n\\[ \\frac{1200 \\text{ minutes}}{3 \\text{ minutes/song}} = 400 \\text{ songs} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of songs John buys in a year.**\n\nSince there are 12 months in a year, the total number of songs John buys in a year is:\n\\[ 400 \\text{ songs/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 4800 \\text{ songs} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total cost of the songs he buys in a year.**\n\nEach song costs $0.50. Therefore, the total cost of the songs John buys in a year is:\n\\[ 4800 \\text{ songs} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/song} = 2400 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the total amount John pays for music in a year is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]",

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert hours to minutes:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 1200 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThe average length of a song is 3 minutes. Therefore, the number of songs John buys in a month is:\n\\[ \\frac{1200 \\text{ minutes}}{3 \\text{ minutes/song}} = 400 \\text{ songs} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of songs John buys in a year.**\n\nSince there are 12 months in a year, the number of songs John buys in a year is:\n\\[ 400 \\text{ songs/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 4800 \\text{ songs} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the songs he buys in a year.**\n\nEach song costs $0.50. Therefore, the total cost of the songs he buys in a year is:\n\\[ 4800 \\text{ songs} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/song} = 2400 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the total amount John pays for music a year is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]",
        "To determine how much John pays for music a year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of songs John buys in a month:**\n   - John buys 20 hours of music a month.\n   - Each hour contains 60 minutes.\n   - Therefore, the total minutes of music he buys in a month is:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 1200 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - The average length of a song is 3 minutes.\n   - Thus, the total number of songs he buys in a month is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1200 \\text{ minutes}}{3 \\text{ minutes/song}} = 400 \\text{ songs}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of songs John buys in a year:**\n   - John buys 400 songs a month.\n   - There are 12 months in a year.\n   - Therefore, the total number of songs he buys in a year is:\n     \\[\n     400 \\text{ songs/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 4800 \\text{ songs}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the songs John buys in a year:**\n   - Each song costs $0.50.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for 4800 songs is:\n     \\[\n     4800 \\text{ songs} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/song} = 2400 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, John pays \\(\\boxed{2400}\\) dollars for music a year.",
