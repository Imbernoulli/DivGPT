        "To determine how many bags of Doritos will be in each pile, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of Doritos bags.\n2. Divide the number of Doritos bags by 4 to find out how many bags will be in each pile.\n\nFirst, we find out how many of the 80 bags of chips are Doritos. Since one quarter of the bags are Doritos, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Doritos bags} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 80 = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to divide the 20 bags of Doritos into 4 equal piles. So, we divide 20 by 4:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Doritos bags in each pile} = \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bags of Doritos in each pile is \\boxed{5}.",

So, we multiply 80 by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\n80 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 20\n\\]\n\nThis means Mohammad has 20 bags of Doritos.\n\nNext, we need to divide the 20 bags of Doritos into 4 equal piles. We do this by dividing 20 by 4:\n\n\\[\n20 \\div 4 = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, each pile will have 5 bags of Doritos. Therefore, the number of bags of Doritos in each pile is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine how many bags of Doritos Mohammad has, we start by calculating one quarter of the 80 bags of chips. Since one quarter is equivalent to \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), we multiply 80 by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\n80 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, Mohammad has 20 bags of Doritos.
