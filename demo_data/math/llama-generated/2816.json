        "To determine how many months Joe can buy games and sell them before he is out of money, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Amount**: Joe starts with $240.\n2. **Monthly Expenditure**: Joe spends $50 each month on games.\n3. **Revenue from Selling Games**: Joe sells each game for $30 after he is done playing it.\n4. **Net Cost per Game**: The net cost per game is the blue cost minus the revenue from selling it, which is $50 - $30 = $20.\n\nWe need to find out how many months \\( m \\) Joe can predicate games before his money runs out. Each month, the net cost for Joe is $20, so after \\( m \\) months, the total net cost is \\( 20m \\). Joe starts with $240, so the equation we need to solve is:\n\n\\[ 240 - 20m = 0 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( m \\):\n\n\\[ 240 = 20m \\]\n\\[ m = \\frac{240}{20} \\]\n\\[ m = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, Joe can buy games for \\(\\boxed{12}\\) months and sell them before he is out of money.",
