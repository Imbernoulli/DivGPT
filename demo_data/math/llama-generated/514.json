Since one-third of the students who went to the playground are boys, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of boys on the playground} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 15 = 5\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of girls on the playground is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls on the playground} = 15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\nSo, the number of girls on the playground is \\boxed{10}.",
