        "To determine how many 4-ounce glasses Claudia can fill with the remaining water, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of water used for the 5-ounce glasses:**\n   Claudia fills six 5-ounce glasses. Therefore, the total amount of water used for these glasses is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of water used for the 8-ounce glasses:**\n   Claudia fills four 8-ounce glasses. Therefore, the total amount of water used for these glasses is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 8 = 32 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of water used for both the 5-ounce and 8-ounce glasses:**\n   Add the amounts of water used for the 5-ounce glasses and the 8-ounce glasses:\n   \\[\n   30 + 32 = 62 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the remaining amount of water:**\n   Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water:\n   \\[\n   122 - 62 = 60 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of 4-ounce glasses that can be filled with the remaining water:**\n   Divide the remaining amount of water by the capacity of each 4-ounce glass:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{4} = 15\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Claudia can fill \\(\\boxed{15}\\) 4-ounce glasses with the remaining water.",

Calculate the total amount of water used to fill the 8-ounce glasses:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ glasses} \\times 8 \\text{ ounces/glass} = 32 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water to find the remaining water:\n   \\[\n   122 \\text{ ounces} - 30 \\text{ ounces} - 32 \\text{ ounces} = 60 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n4. Determine how many 4-ounce glasses can be filled with the remaining water:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ ounces} \\div 4 \\text{ ounces/glass} = 15 \\text{ glasses}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of 4-ounce glasses Claudia can fill with the remaining water is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
