        "To determine how much more money Logan must make each year to have at least $42,000 left after his expenses, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Logan's total annual expenses.\n2. Subtract Logan's total annual expenses from his current annual income.\n3. Determine how much more money Logan needs to make to have at least $42,000 left.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Logan's total annual expenses. Logan spends $20,000 on rent, $5,000 on groceries, and $8,000 on gas. Adding these amounts together, we get:\n\\[\n20,000 + 5,000 + 8,000 = 33,000\n\\]\nSo, Logan's total annual expenses are $33,000.\n\nNext, we subtract Logan's total annual expenses from his current annual income to find out how much money he currently has left after his expenses:\n\\[\n65,000 - 33,000 = 32,000\n\\]\nLogan currently has $32,000 left after his expenses. He wants to have at least $42,000 left. To find out how much more money he needs to make, we subtract the amount he currently has left from the amount he wants to have left:\n\\[\n42,000 - 32,000 = 10,000\n\\]\nTherefore, Logan needs to make an additional $10,000 each year to have at least $42,000 left after his expenses. The answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10000}\n\\]",
