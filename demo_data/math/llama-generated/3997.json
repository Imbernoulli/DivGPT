        "To determine the total revenue generated from the show, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of people who attended the second showing.\n2. Determine the total number of tickets sold for both showings.\n3. Calculate the total revenue by multiplying the total number of tickets by the price per ticket.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of people who attended the second showing.**\n\nThe problem states that three times as many people attended the second showing as the first showing. Since 200 people attended the first showing, we can calculate the number of people who attended the second showing as follows:\n\\[ 3 \\times 200 = 600 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of tickets sold for both showings.**\n\nTo find the total number of tickets sold, we add the number of tickets sold for the first showing to the number of tickets sold for the second showing:\n\\[ 200 + 600 = 800 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue by multiplying the total number of tickets by the price per ticket.**\n\nEach ticket costs $25, so the total revenue is:\n\\[ 800 \\times 25 = 20000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total revenue generated from the show is \\(\\boxed{20000}\\).",
