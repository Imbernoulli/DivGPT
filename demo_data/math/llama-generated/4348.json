        "To determine the total number of pages Janine read in two months, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. Calculate the number of books Janine read this month.\n   Janine read twice as many books this month as she did last month. Since she read 5 books last month, we multiply 5 by 2:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 2 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, Janine read 10 books this month.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of books Janine read in two months.\n   We add the number of books she read last month to the number of books she read this month:\n   \\[\n   5 + 10 = 15\n   \\]\n   So, Janine read a total of 15 books in two months.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of pages Janine read in two months.\n   Each book has 10 pages, so we multiply the total number of books by the number of pages per book:\n   \\[\n   15 \\times 10 = 150\n   \\]\n   So, Janine read a total of 150 pages in two months.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages Janine read in two months is \\boxed{150}.",
