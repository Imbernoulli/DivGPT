        "To determine the total number of spokes in the garage, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of bicycles.\n2. Determine the number of wheels on each bicycle.\n3. Find out how many spokes are on each wheel.\n4. Calculate the total number of spokes by multiplying the number of bicycles by the number of wheels per bicycle and then by the number of spokes per wheel.\n\nLet's break it down:\n- Billy's family owns 4 bicycles.\n- Each bicycle has 2 wheels.\n- Each wheel has 10 spokes.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of wheels:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ bicycles} \\times 2 \\text{ wheels per bicycle} = 8 \\text{ wheels} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of spokes:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ wheels} \\times 10 \\text{ spokes per wheel} = 80 \\text{ spokes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of spokes inside the garage is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
