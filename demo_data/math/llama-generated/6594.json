        "To determine how many large pizzas Ben and his two brothers need to order if they order 1 small pizza, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.\n   - Ben has 2 brothers, so there are 3 people in total (Ben + 2 brothers).\n   - Each person can eat 12 slices of pizza.\n   - Therefore, the total number of slices needed is \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\).\n\n2. Determine how many slices are provided by the 1 small pizza.\n   - A small pizza has 8 slices.\n   - Therefore, the number of slices provided by 1 small pizza is 8.\n\n3. Calculate how many more slices are needed after ordering 1 small pizza.\n   - The total number of slices needed is 36.\n   - The number of slices provided by 1 small pizza is 8.\n   - Therefore, the number of additional slices needed is \\(36 - 8 = 28\\).\n\n4. Determine how many large pizzas are needed to provide the remaining slices.\n   - A large pizza has 14 slices.\n   - Therefore, the number of large pizzas needed is \\(\\frac{28}{14} = 2\\).\n\nSo, if they order 1 small pizza, they need to order \\(\\boxed{2}\\) large pizzas.",

        "To determine how many large pizzas Ben and his two brothers need to order, we start by calculating the total number of pizza slices they will consumption. Since each of them can eat 12 slices, we multiply the number of slices each one eats by the number of people (Ben and his two brothers, which is 3):\n\n\\[ 12 \\text{ slices/person} \\times 3 \\text{ people} = 36 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nNext, we know they are ordering 1 small pizza, which has 8 slices. We subtract the number of slices from the small pizza from the total number of slices needed:\n\n\\[ 36 \\text{ slices} - 8 \\text{ slices} = 28 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many large pizzas are required to provide the remaining 28 slices. Each large pizza has 14 slices, so we divide the remaining number of slices by the number of slices per large pizza:\n\n\\[ 28 \\text{ slices} \\div 14 \\text{ slices/pizza} = 2 \\text{ pizzas} \\]\n\nTherefore, they need to order \\(\\boxed{2}\\) large pizzas.",

Subtract the number of slices provided by the small pizza from the total number of slices needed.\n3. Determine how many large pizzas are required for the remaining slices.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices needed. Ben has two brothers, so there are three boys in total. Each boy can eat 12 slices of pizza. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of slices provided by the small pizza from the total number of slices needed. Since they are ordering 1 small pizza, which has 8 slices, the number of slices still needed is:\n\\[ 36 - 8 = 28 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many large pizzas are required for the remaining 28 slices. Since each large pizza has 14 slices, the number of large pizzas needed is:\n\\[ 28 \\div 14 = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, they need to order \\(\\boxed{2}\\) large pizzas.",
