Therefore, the total number of packs of animal crackers is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ packs} \\]\n\nEach pack contains 10 animal crackers. So, the total number of animal crackers is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ packs} \\times 10 \\text{ animal crackers per pack} = 200 \\text{ animal crackers} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of animal crackers not eaten.**\n\n2 students did not eat their animal crackers. Since each student received 1 pack of animal crackers, the total number of packs not eaten is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ packs} \\]\n\nEach pack contains 10 animal crackers. So, the total number of animal crackers not eaten is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ packs} \\times 10 \\text{ animal crackers per pack} = 20 \\text{ animal crackers} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of animal crackers not eaten from the total number of animal crackers brought.**\n\nThe total number of animal crackers eaten is:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ animal crackers} - 20 \\text{ animal crackers not eaten} = 180 \\text{ animal crackers} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of animal crackers eaten among Mrs. Gable’s students is:\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]"
