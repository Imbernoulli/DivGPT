        "To determine how many hours Tristan spends studying on Saturday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total study time from Monday to Friday:**\n   - On Monday, Tristan studies for 4 hours.\n   - On Tuesday, he studies for twice as long as Monday, which is \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) hours.\n   - On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, he studies for 3 hours each day. Therefore, for these three days, the total study time is \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) hours.\n\n   Adding these amounts together:\n   \\[\n   4 + 8 + 9 = 21 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the remaining study time for the weekend:**\n   - Tristan wants to study a total of 25 hours over the week.\n   - Subtract the total study time from Monday to Friday from the desired total:\n     \\[\n     25 - 21 = 4 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Divide the remaining study time evenly between Saturday and Sunday:**\n   - Since the remaining study time is 4 hours and it is to be divided evenly between Saturday and Sunday, each day will have:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Tristan spends \\(\\boxed{2}\\) hours studying on Saturday.",
