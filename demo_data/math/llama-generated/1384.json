Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount to get the final cost.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the quiches:**\n   Silvia orders 2 quiches, and each quiche costs $15.00.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 15 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the quiches is $30.00.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the croissants:**\n   Silvia orders 6 croissants, and each croissant costs $3.00.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 3 = 18\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the croissants is $18.00.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the buttermilk biscuits:**\n   Silvia orders 6 buttermilk biscuits, and each buttermilk biscuit costs $2.00.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 2 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the buttermilk biscuits is $12.00.\n\n4. **Add the costs of all the items to get the total cost before the discount:**\n   \\[\n   30 + 18 + 12 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost before the discount is $60.00.\n\n5. **Determine if the total cost before the discount is eligible for the discount:**\n   Since $60.00 is greater than $50.00, the order is eligible for a 10% discount.\n\n6. **Calculate the discount amount:**\n   The discount is 10% of the total cost before the discount.\n   \\[\n   0.10 \\times 60 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the discount amount is $6.00.\n\n7. **Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount to get the final cost:**\n   \\[\n   60 - 6 = 54\n   \\]\n   So, the final cost of the order is $54.00.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{54}\n\\]",
