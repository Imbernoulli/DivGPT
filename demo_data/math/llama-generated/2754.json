        "To determine how many problems have no one but Angela finished, we need to calculate the number of problems each friend has completed and then subtract the total from the total number of problems.\n\nFirst, we know that Martha has finished 2 problems.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of problems Jenna has finished. Jenna has finished four times the number Martha did minus 2:\n\\[\n4 \\times 2 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6\n\\]\nSo, Jenna has finished 6 problems.\n\nThen, we calculate the number of problems Mark has finished. Mark has finished half the number Jenna did:\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\nSo, Mark has finished 3 problems.\n\nNow, we add up the number of problems finished by Martha, Jenna, and Mark:\n\\[\n2 + 6 + 3 = 11\n\\]\nSo, the total number of problems finished by Martha, Jenna, and Mark is 11.\n\nSince there are 20 problems in total and 11 of them have been finished by Martha, Jenna, and Mark, the number of problems that have no one but Angela finished is:\n\\[\n20 - 11 = 9\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of problems that have no one but Angela finished is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
