Calculate the total number of pages Jessy initially plans to read in a week.\n2. Determine how many more pages she needs to read to meet her goal.\n3. Calculate how many additional pages she should read per day.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages Jessy initially plans to read in a week.**\n\nJessy plans to read 3 times daily, 6 pages each time. Therefore, the number of pages she reads each day is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\text{ pages per day} \\]\n\nSince she reads every day of the week, the total number of pages she reads in a week is:\n\\[ 18 \\times 7 = 126 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many more pages she needs to read to meet her goal.**\n\nThe book has 140 pages, and Jessy plans to read 126 pages. Therefore, the number of additional pages she needs to read is:\n\\[ 140 - 126 = 14 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many additional pages she should read per day.**\n\nSince Jessy reads every day of the week, the number of additional pages she should read per day is:\n\\[ \\frac{14}{7} = 2 \\text{ pages per day} \\]\n\nThus, Jessy should read \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more pages per day to actually achieve her goal.",
        "To determine how many more pages Jessy should read per day to finish her 140-page book in one week, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pages Jessy initially plans to read in one week.\n2. Determine the difference between the total number of pages she needs to read and the total number of pages she initially plans to read.\n3. Find out how many more pages she should read per day to make up for the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pages Jessy initially plans to read in one week. She reads 3 times daily, 6 pages each time, and there are 7 days in a week. So, we multiply the number of times she reads each day by the number of pages she reads each time, and then by the number of days in a week:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ times/day} \\times 6 \\text{ pages/time} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 126 \\text{ pages}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the difference between the total number of pages she needs to read and the total number of pages she initially plans to read. The book has 140 pages, so we subtract the number of pages she initially plans to read from the total number of pages:\n\\[\n140 \\text{ pages} - 126 \\text{ pages} = 14 \\text{ pages}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find out how many more pages she should read per day to make up for the difference. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the difference by the number of days:\n\\[\n14 \\text{ pages} \\div 7 \\text{ days} = 2 \\text{ pages/day}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jessy should read \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more pages per day to achieve her goal.",

Determine the difference between the total number of pages she plans to read and the total number of pages she needs to read.\n3. Divide this difference by the number of days in a week to find out how many more pages she should read per day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pages Jessy initially plans to read in one week:\n- Jessy reads 3 times daily.\n- Each time she reads 6 pages.\n- There are 7 days in a week.\n\nSo, the total number of pages she plans to read in one week is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 6 \\times 7 = 126 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more pages Jessy needs to read to finish the book. The book has 140 pages, and she plans to read 126 pages:\n\\[ 140 - 126 = 14 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nFinally, we need to determine how many more pages she should read per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the remaining pages by 7:\n\\[ 14 \\div 7 = 2 \\text{ pages per day} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jessy should read \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more pages per day to achieve her goal.",
        "To determine how many more pages Jessy should read per day to finish her 140-page book in one week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

Find out how many more pages she should read per day.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages Jessy initially plans to read in a week.**\n\nJessy reads 3 times daily, 6 pages each time. So, the number of pages she reads each day is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\text{ pages per day} \\]\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the total number of pages she plans to read in a week is:\n\\[ 18 \\times 7 = 126 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many more pages she needs to read to reach her goal.**\n\nThe book has 140 pages, and Jessy plans to read 126 pages.

        "To determine how many more pages Jessy should read per day to finish her 140-page book in one week, we start by calculating the total number of pages she initially plans to read.\n\nJessy plans to read 3 times daily, with each session consisting of 6 pages. Therefore, the number of pages she reads each day is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\text{ pages per day} \\]\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the total number of pages she plans to read in one week is:\n\\[ 18 \\times 7 = 126 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nHowever, Jessy's goal is to read 140 pages in one week. To find out how many more pages she needs to read, we subtract the number of pages she plans to read from her goal:\n\\[ 140 - 126 = 14 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nSince she has 7 days to make up the difference, the number of additional pages she should read per day is:\n\\[ \\frac{14}{7} = 2 \\text{ pages per day} \\]\n\nThus, Jessy should read \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more pages per day to achieve her goal.",
