        "To determine the number of female worker ants in Stephen's ant farm, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of worker ants:**\n   Stephen has 110 ants in total, and half of them are worker ants.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of worker ants} = \\frac{110}{2} = 55\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of male worker ants:**\n   20 percent of the worker ants are male.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of male worker ants} = 0.20 \\times 55 = 11\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of female worker ants:**\n   The total number of worker ants is 55, and 11 of them are male. Therefore, the number of female worker ants is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of female worker ants} = 55 - 11 = 44\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of female worker ants is \\(\\boxed{44}\\).",
