        "To determine how much money Jerusha earned, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.\n\n1. Let \\( L \\) represent Lottie's earnings in dollars.\n2. According to the problem, Jerusha earned 4 times as much money as Lottie. Therefore, Jerusha's earnings can be expressed as \\( 4L \\) dollars.\n\nNext, we know that together they earned a total of $85. This can be written as the sum of their individual earnings:\n\\[\nL + 4L = 85\n\\]\n\nCombine the terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n5L = 85\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( L \\), divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\\[\nL = \\frac{85}{5} = 17\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Lottie's earnings are $17, we can find Jerusha's earnings by multiplying Lottie's earnings by 4:\n\\[\n4L = 4 \\times 17 = 68\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jerusha earned \\(\\boxed{68}\\) dollars.",
