        "To determine how many times Jerry can throw things before he gets sent to the office, we need to calculate the total number of points he has already accumulated and then find out how many more points he can accumulate without exceeding 100 points.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the points Jerry has already received:\n- Jerry interrupted twice, and each interruption earns him 5 points. So, the points from interrupting are:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 5 = 10\n  \\]\n- Jerry insulted his classmates four times, and each insult earns him 10 points. So, the points from insulting are:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 10 = 40\n  \\]\n- Adding the points from interrupting and insulting gives:\n  \\[\n  10 + 40 = 50\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more points Jerry can accumulate without exceeding 100 points. This is done by subtracting the points he already has from 100:\n\\[\n100 - 50 = 50\n\\]\n\nEach time Jerry throws something, he earns 25 points. To find out how many times he can throw things, we divide the remaining points by the points per throw:\n\\[\n50 \\div 25 = 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jerry can throw things \\(\\boxed{2}\\) times before he gets sent to the office.",
