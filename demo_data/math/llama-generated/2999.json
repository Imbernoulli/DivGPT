        "To determine the cost of a single figurine, we start by calculating the total cost of the televisions Annie bought. Each television costs $50, and she bought 5 televisions. Therefore, the total cost for the televisions is:\n\n\\[ 50 \\times 5 = 250 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we know that the total amount Annie spent is $260. To find out how much she spent on the figurines, we subtract the total cost of the televisions from the total amount spent:\n\n\\[ 260 - 250 = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAnnie bought 10 figurines, so to find the cost of a single figurine, we divide the total cost of the figurines by the number of figurines:\n\n\\[ \\frac{10}{10} = 1 \\text{ dollar} \\]\n\nThus, the cost of a single figurine is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",

Divide the total cost of the figurines by the number of figurines to find the cost of a single figurine.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the televisions:**\n   Annie bought 5 televisions, and each television costs $50.\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 50 = 250\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the televisions is $250.\n\n2. **Subtract the total cost of the televisions from the total amount spent to find the total cost of the figurines:**\n   Annie spent $260 in total. After buying the televisions, the remaining amount spent on figurines is:\n   \\[\n   260 - 250 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the figurines is $10.\n\n3. **Divide the total cost of the figurines by the number of figurines to find the cost of a single figurine:**\n   Annie bought 10 figurines. The cost of a single figurine is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{10} = 1\n   \\]\n   So, the cost of a single figurine is $1.\n\nTherefore, the cost of a single figurine is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",
