        "Let's denote the initial amount of money Jason had as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, Jason spent \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of his money and an additional $10 on books.

The least common multiple of 4 and 10 is 20. So, we rewrite the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{3x}{4} = \\frac{3x \\cdot 5}{4 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{15x}{20}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{3x}{10} = \\frac{3x \\cdot 2}{10 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{6x}{20}\n\\]\nNow we can combine the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{15x}{20} - \\frac{6x}{20} - 14 = \\frac{9x}{20} - 14\n\\]\nWe know that after buying the DVDs, Jason is left with $130. So, we set up the following equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{9x}{20} - 14 = 130\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first add 14 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{9x}{20} = 144\n\\]\nNext, we multiply both sides by 20 to clear the fraction:\n\\[\n9x = 144 \\cdot 20 = 2880\n\\]\nFinally, we divide both sides by 9:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2880}{9} = 320\n\\]\nTherefore, the initial amount of money Jason had is \\(\\boxed{320}\\).",
