Therefore, Jeremy's initial amount of money is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 3000 = 6000\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total cost of the computer and accessories from Jeremy's initial amount of money. The total cost of the computer and accessories is:\n\\[\n3000 + 300 = 3300\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Jeremy has after the purchase is:\n\\[\n6000 - 3300 = 2700\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2700}\n\\]",

Subtract the total cost of the computer and the accessories from the amount of money Jeremy had before the purchase.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of the accessories is 10% of the price of the computer. The price of the computer is $3000.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of accessories} = 0.10 \\times 3000 = 300\n   \\]\n\n2. The total cost of the computer and the accessories is the sum of the price of the computer and the cost of the accessories.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 3000 + 300 = 3300\n   \\]\n\n3. Jeremy had two times more money than the cost of the computer before the purchase. The cost of the computer is $3000.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money before purchase} = 2 \\times 3000 = 6000\n   \\]\n\n4. The amount of money Jeremy has after the purchase is the amount of money he had before the purchase minus the total cost of the computer and the accessories.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money after purchase} = 6000 - 3300 = 2700\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Jeremy has after the purchase is \\(\\boxed{2700}\\).",

Calculate the initial amount of money Jeremy had.\n4. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the accessories.**\n\nThe accessories cost 10% of the price of the computer. The price of the computer is $3000.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of accessories} = 0.10 \\times 3000 = 300\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total amount spent.**\n\nThe total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the computer and the cost of the accessories.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount spent} = 3000 + 300 = 3300\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the initial amount of money Jeremy had.**\n\nJeremy had two times more money than the cost of the computer itself. The cost of the computer is $3000.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial amount of money} = 2 \\times 3000 = 6000\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money.**\n\nThe amount of money Jeremy has left after the purchase is the initial amount of money minus the total amount spent.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount of money left} = 6000 - 3300 = 2700\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Jeremy has left is \\(\\boxed{2700}\\)."
