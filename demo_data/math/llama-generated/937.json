        "To determine how much Paul earns from his parents, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of states in the United States.\n2. Determine what percentage of the total number of states Paul has plates from.\n3. Calculate the amount of money Paul earns based on the percentage.\n\nFirst, we know there are 50 states in the United States. Paul has plates from 40 different states. To find out what percentage of the total number of states he has plates from, we use the formula for percentage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of states Paul has plates from}}{\\text{Total number of states}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the numbers into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{40}{50} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.8 \\times 100 = 80\\%\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that for each percentage point of total US states that he has, his parents will give him $2. Therefore, we need to find out how much he earns for 80 percentage points:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings} = 80 \\times 2 = 160\n\\]\n\nSo, Paul earns \\(\\boxed{160}\\) dollars from his parents.",

Therefore, we multiply the percentage by $2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount earned} = 80 \\times 2 = 160\n\\]\n\nSo, the amount Paul earns from his parents is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{160}\n\\]",

To find out what percentage of the total US states he has, we use the formula for percentage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of states Paul has}}{\\text{Total number of states}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{40}{50} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.8 \\times 100 = 80\\%\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much money Paul earns. His parents give him $2 for each percentage point of total US states that he has. Since Paul has 80% of the states, we multiply 80 by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount earned} = 80 \\times 2 = 160\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Paul earns \\(\\boxed{160}\\) dollars from his parents.",

To find the percentage, we use the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of states Paul has}}{\\text{Total number of states}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{40}{50} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.8 \\times 100 = 80\\%\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Paul earns.**\n\nPaul earns $2 for each percentage point of total US states that he has. Therefore, we multiply the percentage by $2:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount earned} = 80 \\times 2 = 160\n\\]\n\nSo, Paul earns \\(\\boxed{160}\\) dollars from his parents.",
