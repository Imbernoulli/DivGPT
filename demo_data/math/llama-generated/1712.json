        "To determine the total number of journal pages each student will write in 6 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the number of pages each student writes in one week.\n   - Each student writes 4 pages per session.\n   - There are 3 sessions per week.\n   - Therefore, the number of pages each student writes in one week is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ pages/session} \\times 3 \\text{ sessions/week} = 12 \\text{ pages/week}\n     \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of pages each student writes in 6 weeks.\n   - Each student writes 12 pages per week.\n   - There are 6 weeks.\n   - Therefore, the number of pages each student writes in 6 weeks is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ pages/week} \\times 6 \\text{ weeks} = 72 \\text{ pages}\n     \\]\n\nThus, each student will write \\(\\boxed{72}\\) journal pages in 6 weeks.",
