        "To determine how many coins Rosie will get as change, we start by calculating the difference between the amount she paid and the cost of the candy. Rosie paid with a $1 bill, which is equivalent to 100 cents, and the candy costs $0.44, which is equivalent to 44 cents. Therefore, the change Rosie should receive is:\n\n\\[ 100 - 44 = 56 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the smallest number of coins that make up 56 cents. The possible coin denominations are quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents), and pennies (1 cent). We start with the largest denomination and work our way down:\n\n1. ** Quarters**: We can use as many quarters as possible without exceeding 56 cents. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, we can use 2 quarters:\n   \\[ 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\text{ cents} \\]\n   After using 2 quarters, we have:\n   \\[ 56 - 50 = 6 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\n2. ** Dimes**: We can use as many dimes as possible without exceeding 6 cents. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, we can use 0 dimes:\n   \\[ 0 \\times 10 = 0 \\text{ cents} \\]\n   After using 0 dimes, we still have:\n   \\[ 6 - 0 = 6 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\n3. ** Nickels**: We can use as many nickels as possible without exceeding 6 cents. Since each nickel is worth 5 cents, we can use 1 nickel:\n   \\[ 1 \\times 5 = 5 \\text{ cents} \\]\n   After using 1 nickel, we have:\n   \\[ 6 - 5 = 1 \\text{ cent} \\]\n\n4. ** Pennies**: We can use as many pennies as possible without exceeding 1 cent. Since each penny is worth 1 cent, we can use 1 penny:\n   \\[ 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\text{ cent} \\]\n   After using 1 penny, we have:\n   \\[ 1 - 1 = 0 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nAdding up all the coins we used, we have:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ quarters} + 0 \\text{ dimes} + 1 \\text{ nickel} + 1 \\text{ penny} = 4 \\text{ coins} \\]\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of coins Rosie will get as change is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
        "To determine the smallest number of coins Rosie will get as change, we first need to calculate the amount of change she is owed. Rosie pays with a $1 bill for a $0.44 piece of candy, so the change is:\n\n\\[ 1.00 - 0.44 = 0.56 \\]\n\nNext, we need to give this change using the fewest number of coins possible. The coins available are quarters ( worth $0.25 each), dimes (worth $0.10 each), nickels (worth $0.05 each), and pennies (worth $0.01 each). We start with the largest denomination and work our way down.\n\n1. **Quarters**: We can use two quarters because \\(2 \\times 0.25 = 0.50\\). This leaves us with:\n\n\\[ 0.56 - 0.50 = 0.06 \\]\n\n2. **Dimes**: We cannot use any dimes because $0.10 is greater than $0.06.\n\n3. **Nickels**: We can use one nickel because \\(1 \\times 0.05 = 0.05\\). This leaves us with:\n\n\\[ 0.06 - 0.05 = 0.01 \\]\n\n4. **Pennies**: We can use one penny because \\(1 \\times 0.01 = 0.01\\).

        "To determine the smallest number of coins Rosie will get as change when she pays for a $0.44 piece of candy with a $1 bill, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of change Rosie should receive:\n   \\[\n   1.00 - 0.44 = 0.56\n   \\]\n   So, Rosie should get $0.56 in change.\n\n2. Determine the combination of coins that add up to $0.56 using the smallest number of coins. The coins available are quarters ( worth $0.25), dimes (worth $0.10), nickels (worth $0.05), and pennies (worth $0.01).\n\n3. Start with the largest denomination and work down:\n   - First, consider the quarters. The maximum number of quarters that can be given without exceeding $0.56 is 2 (since $0.25 * 2 = $0.50).\n   - After giving 2 quarters, the remaining change is:\n     \\[\n     0.56 - 0.50 = 0.06\n     \\]\n   - Next, consider the dimes. The maximum number of dimes that can be given without exceeding $0.06 is 0 (since $0.10 > $0.06).\n   - Then, consider the nickels. The maximum number of nickels that can be given without exceeding $0.06 is 1 (since $0.05 * 1 = $0.05).\n   - After giving 1 nickel, the remaining change is:\n     \\[\n     0.06 - 0.05 = 0.01\n     \\]\n   - Finally, consider the pennies. The maximum number of pennies that can be given without exceeding $0.01 is 1 (since $0.01 * 1 = $0.01).\n\n4. Add up the total number of coins given:\n   - 2 quarters\n   - 1 nickel\n   - 1 penny\n\n   The total number of coins is:\n   \\[\n   2 + 1 + 1 = 4\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of coins Rosie will get as change is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
