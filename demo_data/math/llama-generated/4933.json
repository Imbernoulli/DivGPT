        "To determine how many doughnuts each person will receive, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts Samuel and Cathy bought.\n2. Determine the total number of people (Samuel, Cathy, and their 8 friends).\n3. Divide the total number of doughnuts by the total number of people.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of doughnuts Samuel and Cathy bought. Samuel bought 2 dozen doughnuts, and since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, Samuel bought:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ doughnuts} \\]\n\nCathy bought 3 dozen doughnuts, so she bought:\n\\[ 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\text{ doughnuts} \\]\n\nAdding the doughnuts Samuel and Cathy bought together gives:\n\\[ 24 + 36 = 60 \\text{ doughnuts} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the total number of people. Samuel and Cathy are sharing the doughnuts with their 8 other friends, so the total number of people is:\n\\[ 2 + 8 = 10 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nNow, we divide the total number of doughnuts by the total number of people to find out how many doughnuts each person will receive:\n\\[ \\frac{60}{10} = 6 \\text{ doughnuts per person} \\]\n\nTherefore, each person will receive \\(\\boxed{6}\\) doughnuts.",
