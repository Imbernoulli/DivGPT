        "To determine how many apple pies Sandra can make, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the weight of apples used to make applesauce.\n2. Calculate the weight of apples left for making apple pies.\n3. Determine how many apple pies can be made with the remaining apples.\n\nFirst, we calculate the weight of apples used to make applesauce:\n\\[\n\\text{Weight of apples for applesauce} = \\frac{120}{2} = 60 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the weight of apples left for making apple pies:\n\\[\n\\text{Weight of apples for apple pies} = 120 - 60 = 60 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThen, we determine how many apple pies Sandra can make with the remaining apples. Since each pie requires 4 pounds of apples, we divide the weight of apples left by the weight needed per pie:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of apple pies} = \\frac{60}{4} = 15\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Sandra will be able to make \\boxed{15} pies.",
