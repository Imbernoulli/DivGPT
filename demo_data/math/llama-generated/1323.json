        "To determine the total number of different movies watched by Dalton, Hunter, and Alex, we need to consider both the movies they watched individually and the movies they watched together.\n\n1. **Identify the total number of movies each person watched:**\n   - Dalton watched 7 movies.\n   - Hunter watched 12 movies.\n   - Alex watched 15 movies.\n\n2. **Account for the movies they watched together:**\n   - They all watched 2 movies together.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of unique movies each person watched:**\n   - Dalton watched 7 movies in total, but 2 of these were watched with Hunter and Alex. Therefore, the number of unique movies Dalton watched is:\n     \\[\n     7 - 2 = 5\n     \\]\n   - Hunter watched 12 movies in total, but 2 of these were watched with Dalton and Alex. Therefore, the number of unique movies Hunter watched is:\n     \\[\n     12 - 2 = 10\n     \\]\n   - Alex watched 15 movies in total, but 2 of these were watched with Dalton and Hunter. Therefore, the number of unique movies Alex watched is:\n     \\[\n     15 - 2 = 13\n     \\]\n\n4. **Add the unique movies watched by each person and the movies watched together:**\n   - Unique movies watched by Dalton: 5\n   - Unique movies watched by Hunter: 10\n   - Unique movies watched by Alex: 13\n   - Movies watched together: 2\n\n   The total number of different movies is:\n   \\[\n   5 + 10 + 13 + 2 = 30\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of different movies they saw is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

** involuntary movies:**\n   - Dalton watched 7 movies.\n   - Hunter watched 12 movies.\n   - Alex watched 15 movies.\n\n2. **เสื้อผ้า侦察 movies:**\n   - They all watched 2 movies together.\n\n3. **Calculating unique movies for each person:**\n   - Dalton watched 7 movies in total, including the 2 movies they watched together.\n   - Therefore, the number of unique movies Dalton watched is \\(7 - 2 = 5\\).\n   - Hunter watched 12 movies in total, including the 2 movies they watched together.\n   - Therefore, the number of unique movies Hunter watched is \\(12 - 2 = 10\\).\n   - Alex watched 15 movies in total, including the 2 movies they watched together.\n   - Therefore, the number of unique movies Alex watched is \\(15 - 2 = 13\\).\n\n4. **Adding all unique movies:**\n   - Unique movies watched by Dalton: 5\n   - Unique movies watched by Hunter: 10\n   - Unique movies watched by Alex: 13\n\n   Adding these together gives:\n   \\[\n   5 + 10 + 13 + 2 = 30\n   zero

        "To determine the total number of different movies Dalton, Hunter, and Alex saw, we need to consider the movies they watched individually and the movies they watched together.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of movies each person watched that were not watched by the other two. \n\n- Dalton watched 7 movies in total, and 2 of those movies were watched together. Therefore, the number of movies Dalton watched that were not watched by Hunter or Alex is:\n  \\[\n  7 - 2 = 5\n  \\]\n\n- Hunter watched 12 movies in total, and 2 of those movies were watched together. Therefore, the number of movies Hunter watched that were not watched by Dalton or Alex is:\n  \\[\n  12 - 2 = 10\n  \\]\n\n- Alex watched 15 movies in total, and 2 of those movies were watched together. Therefore, the number of movies Alex watched that were not watched by Dalton or Hunter is:\n  \\[\n  15 - 2 = 13\n  \\]\n\nNext, we add up the number of movies each person watched that were not watched by the others, and then add the number of movies they watched together:\n\\[\n5 + 10 + 13 + 2 = 30\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of different movies they saw is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{30}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of different movies watched by Dalton, Hunter, and Alex, we need to account for the movies they watched individually and the movies they watched together.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of movies each person watched that were not watched by the others. Dalton watched 7 movies in total, but 2 of those were watched together. Therefore, the number of movies Dalton watched alone is:\n\\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \\]\n\nNext, Hunter watched 12 movies in total, but 2 of those were watched together. Therefore, the number of movies Hunter watched alone is:\n\\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \\]\n\nAlex watched 15 movies in total, but 2 of those were watched together.

        "To determine the total number of different movies watched by Dalton, Hunter, and Alex, we need to consider the movies they watched individually and the movies they watched together.\n\nFirst, let's break down the number of movies each person watched:\n- Dalton watched 7 movies.\n- Hunter watched 12 movies.\n- Alex watched 15 movies.\n\nNext, we account for the movies they watched together. They all watched 2 movies together, so these 2 movies are included in the total count of movies watched by each person. However, since we are looking for the total number of different movies, we need to subtract the 2 movies they watched together from the individual counts to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, the number of different movies watched by each person is:\n- Dalton: \\(7 - 2 = 5\\)\n- Hunter: \\(12 - 2 = 10\\)\n- Alex: \\(15 - 2 = 13\\)\n\nNow, we add up the number of different movies watched by each person, plus the 2 movies they watched together:\n\\[5 + 10 + 13 + 2 = 30\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of different movies they saw is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

Next, we account for the movies they watched together. They all watched 2 movies together, so these 2 movies are counted in the total for each person. However, these 2 movies should not be counted multiple times in the total number of different movies.\n\n3. To find the total number of different movies, we add the number of movies each person watched and then subtract the number of movies they watched together (since these are counted multiple times in the initial sum):\n   \\[\n   7 + 12 + 15 - 2 \\times 2 = 7 + 12 + 15 - 4 = 30\n   \\]\n   Here, we subtract \\(2 \\times 2\\) because the 2 movies they watched together are counted twice in the sum of 7, 12, and 15.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different movies they saw is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of different movies Dalton, Hunter, and Alex saw, we need to account for the movies they watched together and the movies they watched individually.\n\nFirst, we note that they all watched 2 movies together.
