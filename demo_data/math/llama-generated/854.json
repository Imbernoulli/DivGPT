        "First, we determine the number of girls and boys in June's class. Since 60% of the 25 students are girls, we calculate the number of girls as follows:\n\\[\n0.60 \\times 25 = 15\n\\]\nThis means there are 15 girls in the class. The rest of the students are boys, so we calculate the number of boys as follows:\n\\[\n25 - 15 = 10\n\\]\nThis means there are 10 boys in the class.\n\nNext, we determine how many boys like playing basketball. Since 40% of the boys like playing basketball, we calculate the number of boys who like playing basketball as follows:\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 10 = 4\n\\]\nThis means there are 4 boys who like playing basketball. Therefore, the number of boys who don't like playing basketball is:\n\\[\n10 - 4 = 6\n\\]\nWe are given that the number of girls who like playing basketball is double the number of boys who don't like playing basketball. Therefore, the number of girls who like playing basketball is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 6 = 12\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of the girls in the class who like playing basketball. Since there are 15 girls in total and 12 of them like playing basketball, we calculate the percentage as follows:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{12}{15} \\right) \\times 100 = 80\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage of the girls in the class who like playing basketball is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{80}\n\\]",

Since there are 25 students and 60% are girls, the number of girls is:\n\\[ 0.60 \\times 25 = 15 \\]\nThe number of boys is:\n\\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \\]\n\nNext, determine the number of boys who like playing basketball and the number who don't. Since 40% of the boys like playing basketball, the number of boys who like playing basketball is:\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 10 = 4 \\]\nThe number of boys who don't like playing basketball is:\n\\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \\]\n\nWe are given that the number of girls who like playing basketball is double the number of boys who don't like playing basketball. Therefore, the number of girls who like playing basketball is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\]\n\nFinally, calculate the percentage of girls who like playing basketball. The percentage is:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{12}{15} \\right) \\times 100 = 80\\% \\]\n\nThus, the percentage of the girls in the class who like playing basketball is:\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]",
