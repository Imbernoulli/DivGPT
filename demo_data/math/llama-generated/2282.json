        "To find out how much one box of tissues costs, we start by calculating the total cost of the toilet paper and paper towels. We know that Amber bought 10 rolls of toilet paper and 7 rolls of paper towels. The cost of one roll of toilet paper is $1.50 and the cost of one roll of paper towels is $2.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of the toilet paper:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ rolls} \\times \\$1.50 \\text{ per roll} = \\$15.00 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the paper towels:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ rolls} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per roll} = \\$14.00 \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the toilet paper and the cost of the paper towels to find out how much these items cost together:\n\\[ \\$15.00 + \\$14.00 = \\$29.00 \\]\n\nWe know that the total cost of all the items is $35. Therefore, the cost of the 3 boxes of tissues is:\n\\[ \\$35.00 - \\$29.00 = \\$6.00 \\]\n\nTo find the cost of one box of tissues, we divide the total cost of the tissues by the number of boxes:\n\\[ \\$6.00 \\div 3 \\text{ boxes} = \\$2.00 \\text{ per box} \\]\n\nSo, the cost of one box of tissues is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
        "To determine the cost of one box of tissues, we need to calculate the total cost of the toilet paper and paper towels first, and then use the given total cost to find the cost of the tissues.\n\n1.

Amber buys 3 boxes of tissues, so the cost of the tissues is:\n\n\\[ 3x \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total cost of all the items is given as $35. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:\n\n\\[ 15 + 14 + 3x = 35 \\]\n\nWe simplify the left side of the equation by adding the costs of the toilet paper and paper towels:\n\n\\[ 29 + 3x = 35 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate the term with \\( x \\) by subtracting 29 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 3x = 6 \\]\n\nFinally, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ x = 2 \\]\n\nThus, the cost of one box of tissues is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) dollars."
