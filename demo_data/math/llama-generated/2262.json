Compare the total cost of two visits to the discount clinic with the cost of one visit to the normal doctor to find the savings.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of one visit to the normal doctor is $200.\n\n2. The discount clinic is 70% cheaper than the normal doctor. This means the discount clinic charges 30% of the normal doctor's cost. So, we calculate 30% of $200:\n   \\[\n   0.30 \\times 200 = 60\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the cost of one visit to the discount clinic is $60.\n\n3. Since it takes two visits to the discount clinic, we calculate the total cost for two visits:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 60 = 120\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost for two visits to the discount clinic is $120.\n\n4. To find out how much money Tom saves, we subtract the total cost of two visits to the discount clinic from the cost of one visit to the normal doctor:\n   \\[\n   200 - 120 = 80\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Tom saves $80.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{80}\n\\]",

Find the savings.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of a normal doctor's visit.**\nThe normal doctor charges $200 for a visit.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost of a discount clinic visit.**\nThe discount clinic is 70% cheaper than a normal doctor. First, we find 70% of the normal doctor's charged:\n\\[ 0.70 \\times 200 = 140 \\]\nSo, the discount clinic charged is:\n\\[ 200 - 140 = 60 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for two discount clinic visits.**\nSince it takes two visits, we multiply the cost of one discount clinic visit by 2:\n\\[ 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Compare the total cost of the discount clinic visits to the cost of a normal doctor's visit.**\nThe total cost for two discount clinic visits is $120, and the cost of a normal doctor's visit is $200. The savings is:\n\\[ 200 - 120 = 80 \\]\n\n**Step 5: Find the savings.**\nTom saves \\(\\boxed{80}\\) dollars."
