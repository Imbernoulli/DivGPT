        "To determine how much Tommy spends on flour, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour he needs for his bread. Since he is making 12 loaves and each loaf requires 4 pounds of flour, the total amount of flour needed is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ loaves} \\times 4 \\text{ pounds per loaf} = 48 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out the cost of buying 48 pounds of flour using the cheapest possible option. We have two options for buying flour: 10-pound bags that cost $10 each and 12-pound bags that cost $13 each.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost if Tommy buys 10-pound bags. To get at least 48 pounds, he needs:\n\\[ \\left\\lceil \\frac{48}{10} \\right\\rceil = 5 \\text{ bags} \\]\nThe total cost for 5 bags of 10-pound flour is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ bags} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars per bag} = 50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nSince 5 bags of 10-pound flour give him 50 pounds, he will have 2 pounds left over, which he will throw away.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost if Tommy buys 12-pound bags. To get at least 48 pounds, he needs:\n\\[ \\left\\lceil \\frac{48}{12} \\right\\rceil = 4 \\text{ bags} \\]\nThe total cost for 4 bags of 12-pound flour is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ bags} \\times 13 \\text{ dollars per bag} = 52 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nSince 4 bags of 12-pound flour give him 48 pounds, he will have no flour left over.\n\nComparing the two options, the cost of 5 bags of 10-pound flour is $50, and the cost of 4 bags of 12-pound flour is $52. Therefore, the cheapest option is to buy 5 bags of 10-pound flour, which costs $50.\n\nThe amount Tommy spends on flour is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",

We will calculate the cost for each option and then compare them.\n\n**Option 1: Buying 10-pound bags**\nTo find out how many 10-pound bags are needed, we divide 48 by 10 and round up to the next whole number because Tommy cannot buy a fraction of a bag.\n\\[ \\left\\lceil \\frac{48}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 4.8 \\right\\rceil = 5 \\]\nSo, Tommy needs to buy 5 bags of 10-pound flour.

We will consider the cost of buying combinations of 10-pound and 12-pound bags that add up to at least 48 pounds.\n\nFirst, let's consider buying only 10-pound bags. To find out how many 10-pound bags are needed, we divide 48 by 10 and round up to the next whole number:\n\n\\[ \\left\\lceil \\frac{48}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 4.8 \\right\\rceil = 5 \\]\n\nSo, Tommy would need to buy 5 bags of 10-pound flour. The total cost for 5 bags is:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ bags} \\times \\$10 \\text{ per bag} = \\$50 \\]\n\nNext, let's consider buying only 12-pound bags. To find out how many 12-pound bags are needed, we divide 48 by 12:\n\n\\[ \\frac{48}{12} = 4 \\]\n\nSo, Tommy would need to buy 4 bags of 12-pound flour. The total cost for 4 bags is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{ bags} \\times \\$13 \\text{ per bag} = \\$52 \\]\n\nNow, let's consider a combination of 10-pound and 12-pound bags. We can try to minimize the cost by buying as many 12-pound bags as possible and then adding 10-pound bags if needed.\n\nIf Tommy buys 3 bags of 12-pound flour, he gets:\n\n\\[ 3 \\text{ bags} \\times 12 \\text{ pounds per bag} = 36 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nHe still needs:\n\n\\[ 48 \\text{ pounds} - 36 \\text{ pounds} = 12 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSo, Tommy needs to buy 1 bag of 12-pound flour and no additional 10-pound bags. The total cost for this combination is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\text{ bags} \\times \\$13 \\text{ per bag} + 1 \\text{ bag} \\times \\$13 \\text{ per bag} = \\$39 + \\$13 = \\$52 \\]\n\nComparing the costs of all the options, we see that buying 5 bags of 10-pound flour is the cheapest option at \\$50.\n\nTherefore, the amount Tommy spends on flour is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]",

        "To determine how much Tommy spends on flour, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour required for 12 loaves of bread. Since each loaf requires 4 pounds of flour, we multiply the number of loaves by the amount of flour per loaf:\n\n\\[ 12 \\text{ loaves} \\times 4 \\text{ pounds per loaf} = 48 \\text{ pounds of flour} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much it costs to buy 48 pounds of flour using the cheapest possible option. We have two choices: a 10-pound bag of flour costs $10 and a 12-pound bag of flour costs $13. We start by calculating how many bags of each type are needed and the total cost for each option.\n\n**Option 1: Using 10-pound bags**\nTo find out how many 10-pound bags are needed, we divide the total amount of flour by the weight of each bag:\n\n\\[ \\frac{48 \\text{ pounds}}{10 \\text{ pounds per bag}} = 4.8 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nSince Tommy cannot buy a fraction of a bag, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs 5 bags. The total cost for 5 bags is:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ bags} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars per bag} = 50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Option 2: Using 12-pound bags**\nTo find out how many 12-pound bags are needed, we divide the total amount of flour by the weight of each bag:\n\n\\[ \\frac{48 \\text{ pounds}}{12 \\text{ pounds per bag}} = 4 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nSince 4 is a whole number, Tommy needs exactly 4 bags. The total cost for 4 bags is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{ bags} \\times 13 \\text{ dollars per bag} = 52 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nComparing the total costs of the two options, we see that buying 5 bags of 10-pound flour costs $50, and buying 4 bags of 12-pound flour costs $52. Therefore, the cheapest option is to buy 5 bags of 10-pound flour.\n\nThe amount Tommy spends on flour is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",

Since Tommy is making 12 loaves of bread and each loaf requires 4 pounds of flour, the total amount of flour needed is:\n\n\\[ 12 \\text{ loaves} \\times 4 \\text{ pounds per loaf} = 48 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the cost of the flour. We have two options: a 10-pound bag of flour that costs $10 and a 12-pound bag of flour that costs $13. To find out which option is cheaper, we calculate the cost per pound for each bag.\n\nFor the 10-pound bag:\n\\[ \\text{Cost per pound} = \\frac{10 \\text{ dollars}}{10 \\text{ pounds}} = 1 \\text{ dollar per pound} \\]\n\nFor the 12-pound bag:\n\\[ \\text{Cost per pound} = \\frac{13 \\text{ dollars}}{12 \\text{ pounds}} \\approx 1.0833 \\text{ dollars per pound} \\]\n\nSince the 10-pound bag is cheaper per pound, we should buy as many 10-pound bags as possible to minimize the cost. To find out how many 10-pound bags are needed, we divide the total amount of flour required by the weight of each bag:\n\n\\[ \\frac{48 \\text{ pounds}}{10 \\text{ pounds per bag}} = 4.8 \\]\n\nSince Tommy cannot buy a fraction of a bag, he needs to buy 5 bags of 10-pound flour. The total cost for 5 bags is:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ bags} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars per bag} = 50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nWhen Tommy uses 48 pounds of flour, he will have:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ bags} \\times 10 \\text{ pounds per bag} - 48 \\text{ pounds} = 50 \\text{ pounds} - 48 \\text{ pounds} = 2 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSince Tommy has no use for the remaining 2 pounds of flour, he will throw it away.
