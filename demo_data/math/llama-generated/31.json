        "To determine the total number of laps Jasmine swims in five weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of laps Jasmine swims in one week:**\n   - Jasmine swims 12 laps each day.\n   - She swims from Monday through Friday, which is 5 days a week.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Laps per week} = 12 \\text{ laps/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 60 \\text{ laps/week}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of laps Jasmine swims in five weeks:**\n   - We know she swims 60 laps each week.\n   - We need to find out how many laps she swims over 5 weeks.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total laps in five weeks} = 60 \\text{ laps/week} \\times 5 \\text{ weeks} = 300 \\text{ laps}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of laps Jasmine swims in five weeks is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of laps Jasmine swims in five weeks, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. Calculate the number of laps Jasmine swims in one week.\n   - Jasmine swims 12 laps each day.\n   - She swims from Monday through Friday, which is 5 days.\n   - Therefore, the number of laps she swims in one week is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ laps/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 60 \\text{ laps/week}\n     \\]\n\n2.
