After giving 12 bunnies to Rodney, the number of bunnies Marlon has left is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bunnies left} = 30 - 12 = 18\n   \\]\n   So, Marlon has 18 bunnies left.\n\n3. After another three months, each of the 18 bunnies conceived and gave birth to 2 kittens. The total number of new baby bunnies born is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of new baby bunnies} = 18 \\times 2 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, 36 new baby bunnies were born.\n\n4. The total number of bunnies Marlon has now is the sum of the remaining bunnies and the new baby bunnies:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of bunnies} = 18 + 36 = 54\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of bunnies Marlon has in his hutch now is \\boxed{54}.",

So, the number of bunnies he gave to Rodney is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times 30 = 12\n\\]\nAfter giving 12 bunnies to Rodney, the number of bunnies Marlon has left is:\n\\[\n30 - 12 = 18\n\\]\nNext, after another three months, each of the 18 bunnies conceived and gave birth to 2 baby bunnies. Therefore, the total number of baby bunnies born is:\n\\[\n18 \\times 2 = 36\n\\]\nAdding the number of baby bunnies born to the number of bunnies Marlon has left, we get:\n\\[\n18 + 36 = 54\n\\]\nSo, the total number of bunnies Marlon has in his hutch now is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{54}\n\\]"
