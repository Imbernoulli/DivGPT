Therefore, the number of blue eggs is \\( \\frac{4}{5}E \\) and the number of purple eggs is \\( \\frac{1}{5}E \\).\n\nNext, we need to determine how many eggs have 5 pieces of candy. According to the problem, half of the purple eggs have 5 pieces of candy each. So, the number of purple eggs with 5 pieces of candy is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{5}E = \\frac{1}{10}E\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the blue eggs have 5 pieces of candy each. So, the number of blue eggs with 5 pieces of candy is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{5}E = \\frac{1}{5}E\n\\]\n\nAdding these together, the total number of eggs with 5 pieces of candy is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10}E + \\frac{1}{5}E = \\frac{1}{10}E + \\frac{2}{10}E = \\frac{3}{10}E\n\\]\n\nThe probability that Jerry opens an egg with 5 pieces of candy is the number of eggs with 5 pieces of candy divided by the total number of eggs, which is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{3}{10}E}{E} = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\nTo express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{10} \\times 100 = 30\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage chance that Jerry will get 5 pieces of candy is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
