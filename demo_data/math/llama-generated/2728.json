Determine the total loss by subtracting the total revenue from the total cost.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. **Total cost of the paintings:**\n   Mr. Callen bought 10 paintings at $40 each.\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 40 = 400\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the paintings is $400.\n\n2. **Total cost of the wooden toys:**\n   Mr. Callen bought 8 wooden toys at $20 each.\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 20 = 160\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the wooden toys is $160.\n\n3. **Selling price of each painting:**\n   The selling price of each painting is 10% less than the original price of $40.\n   \\[\n   40 - (0.10 \\times 40) = 40 - 4 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, the selling price of each painting is $36.\n\n4. **Selling price of each wooden toy:**\n   The selling price of each wooden toy is 15% less than the original price of $20.\n   \\[\n   20 - (0.15 \\times 20) = 20 - 3 = 17\n   \\]\n   So, the selling price of each wooden toy is $17.\n\n5. **Total revenue from the sale of the paintings:**\n   Mr. Callen sold 10 paintings at $36 each.\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 36 = 360\n   \\]\n   So, the total revenue from the sale of the paintings is $360.\n\n6. **Total revenue from the sale of the wooden toys:**\n   Mr. Callen sold 8 wooden toys at $17 each.\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 17 = 136\n   \\]\n   So, the total revenue from the sale of the wooden toys is $136.\n\n7. **Total revenue from the sale of all items:**\n   Add the total revenue from the sale of the paintings and the total revenue from the sale of the wooden toys.\n   \\[\n   360 + 136 = 496\n   \\]\n   So, the total revenue from the sale of all items is $496.\n\n8. **Total cost of all items:**\n   Add the total cost of the paintings and the total cost of the wooden toys.\n   \\[\n   400 + 160 = 560\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of all items is $560.\n\n9. **Total loss:**\n   Subtract the total revenue from the total cost.\n   \\[\n   560 - 496 = 64\n   \\]\n   So, the total loss Mr. Callen made from the sale of the items is \\(\\boxed{64}\\).",

Determine the total loss by subtracting the total revenue from the total cost.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. **Total cost of the paintings:**\n   Mr. Callen bought 10 paintings at $40 each.\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 40 = 400\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the paintings is $400.\n\n2. **Total cost of the wooden toys:**\n   Mr. Callen bought 8 wooden toys at $20 each.\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 20 = 160\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the wooden toys is $160.\n\n3. **Selling price of each painting:**\n   The selling price of each painting is 10% less than the purchase price.\n   \\[\n   40 - (0.10 \\times 40) = 40 - 4 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, the selling price of each painting is $36.\n\n4. **Selling price of each wooden toy:**\n   The selling price of each wooden toy is 15% less than the purchase price.\n   \\[\n   20 - (0.15 \\times 20) = 20 - 3 = 17\n   \\]\n   So, the selling price of each wooden toy is $17.\n\n5. **Total revenue from selling the paintings:**\n   Mr. Callen sold 10 paintings at $36 each.\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 36 = 360\n   \\]\n   So, the total revenue from selling the paintings is $360.\n\n6. **Total revenue from selling the wooden toys:**\n   Mr. Callen sold 8 wooden toys at $17 each.\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 17 = 136\n   \\]\n   So, the total revenue from selling the wooden toys is $136.\n\n7. **Total revenue from all items sold:**\n   Add the total revenue from selling the paintings and the wooden toys.\n   \\[\n   360 + 136 = 496\n   \\]\n   So, the total revenue from all items sold is $496.\n\n8. **Total cost of all items bought:**\n   Add the total cost of the paintings and the wooden toys.\n   \\[\n   400 + 160 = 560\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of all items bought is $560.\n\n9. **Total loss:**\n   Subtract the total revenue from the total cost.\n   \\[\n   560 - 496 = 64\n   \\]\n   So, the total loss Mr. Callen made from the sale of the items is \\(\\boxed{64}\\).",
        "To determine the total loss Mr. Callen made from the sale of the items, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he bought and the total revenue he received from selling them.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the items:\n- The cost of the paintings is \\(10 \\times 40 = 400\\) dollars.\n- The cost of the wooden toys is \\(8 \\times 20 = 160\\) dollars.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the items is \\(400 + 160 = 560\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from the sale of the items:\n- The selling price of each painting is \\(40 - 0.10 \\times 40 = 40 - 4 = 36\\) dollars.\n- The selling price of each wooden toy is \\(20 - 0.15 \\times 20 = 20 - 3 = 17\\) dollars.\n- The total revenue from the paintings is \\(10 \\times 36 = 360\\) dollars.\n- The total revenue from the wooden toys is \\(8 \\times 17 = 136\\) dollars.\n- Therefore, the total revenue from the sale of the items is \\(360 + 136 = 496\\) dollars.\n\nFinally, the total loss Mr. Callen made from the sale of the items is the difference between the total cost and the total revenue:\n\\[560 - 496 = 64\\]\n\nThus, the total loss Mr. Callen made from the sale of the items is \\(\\boxed{64}\\) dollars.",
