        "To determine the security deposit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the cabin rental without the service/cleaning fee and the pet fee.\n2. Add the pet fee to the total cost of the cabin rental.\n3. Calculate the service/cleaning fee.\n4. Add the service/cleaning fee to the total cost.\n5. Calculate 50% of the entire bill as the security deposit.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the cabin rental without the service/cleaning fee and the pet fee.\n   The cabin rental is $125.00 per day for 2 weeks. Since there are 14 days in 2 weeks, the cost of the cabin rental is:\n   \\[\n   125.00 \\times 14 = 1750.00\n   \\]\n\n2. Add the pet fee to the total cost of the cabin rental.\n   The pet fee is $100.00, so the new total is:\n   \\[\n   1750.00 + 100.00 = 1850.00\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the service/cleaning fee.\n   The service/cleaning fee is 20% of the total cost before the service/cleaning fee is added. So, the service/cleaning fee is:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 1850.00 = 370.00\n   \\]\n\n4. Add the service/cleaning fee to the total cost.\n   The new total cost is:\n   \\[\n   1850.00 + 370.00 = 2220.00\n   \\]\n\n5. Calculate 50% of the entire bill as the security deposit.\n   The security deposit is:\n   \\[\n   0.50 \\times 2220.00 = 1110.00\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the security deposit is \\(\\boxed{1110.00}\\).",
