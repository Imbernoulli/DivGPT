Calculate the average of the times taken by Casey and Zendaya.\n\nFirst, let's find out how long Zendaya takes to complete the race. We know that Zendaya takes \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) times longer than Casey. Since Casey takes 6 hours, we can calculate Zendaya's time as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Zendaya's time} = 6 + \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 6 + 2 = 8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the average of the times taken by Casey and Zendaya.
