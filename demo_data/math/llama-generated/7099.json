        "To determine how much Melinda, Zoe, and Joel can save by pooling their money together and buying three iPhones at once from the smartphone seller, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of three iPhones if bought individually.\n2. Calculate the total cost of three iPhones if bought together with the discount.\n3. Find the difference between the total cost of buying individually and the total cost of buying together.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of three iPhones if bought individually.**\n\nThe cost of one iPhone X is $600. Therefore, the cost for three iPhones bought individually is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 600 = 1800 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of three iPhones if bought together with the discount.**\n\nThe discount offered is 5%. First, we need to find out what 5% of $1800 is:\n\\[ 0.05 \\times 1800 = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSubtract the discount from the original total cost to get the discounted total cost:\n\\[ 1800 - 90 = 1710 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between the total cost of buying individually and the total cost of buying together.**\n\nThe savings is the difference between the original total cost and the discounted total cost:\n\\[ 1800 - 1710 = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount they can save by pooling their money together and buying three iPhones at once from this seller rather than buying individually is:\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]",

Find the difference between the two total costs to determine the savings.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the iPhones if they buy individually.**\n\nEach iPhone X costs $600, and each of Melinda, Zoe, and Joel wants to buy one.

First, we calculate the discount amount on the total cost of $1800:\n\\[ 1800 \\times 0.05 = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the discount from the original total cost to find the discounted total cost:\n\\[ 1800 - 90 = 1710 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between the two total costs.**\n\nThe savings is the difference between the total cost of buying individually and the total cost of buying together with the discount:\n\\[ 1800 - 1710 = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount they can save by pooling their money together and buying three iPhones at once is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).",
