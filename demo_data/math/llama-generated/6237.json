        "To determine how many hours it will take Jake to bike to the water park, we need to first calculate the total distance from Jake's house to the water park.\n\nJake's dad drives the distance in 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. He spends half of this journey driving at 28 miles per hour and the other half driving at 60 miles per hour.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance driven at each speed:\n- Distance driven at 28 miles per hour:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance}_1 = \\text{Speed}_1 \\times \\text{Time}_1 = 28 \\, \\text{miles per hour} \\times 0.25 \\, \\text{hours} = 7 \\, \\text{miles}\n  \\]\n- Distance driven at 60 miles per hour:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance}_2 = \\text{Speed}_2 \\times \\text{Time}_2 = 60 \\, \\text{miles per hour} \\times 0.25 \\, \\text{hours} = 15 \\, \\text{miles}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we add the two distances to find the total distance:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = \\text{Distance}_1 + \\text{Distance}_2 = 7 \\, \\text{miles} + 15 \\, \\text{miles} = 22 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate how long it will take Jake to bike this distance. Jake bikes at a speed of 11 miles per hour. The time it takes for Jake to bike the total distance is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{22 \\, \\text{miles}}{11 \\, \\text{miles per hour}} = 2 \\, \\text{hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jake \\boxed{2} hours to bike to the water park.",

He spends half of the journey driving 28 miles per hour and the other half driving 60 miles per hour.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time spent driving each half of the journey:\n- Since the total journey time is 0.5 hours, the time spent driving each half is \\(0.5 \\div 2 = 0.25\\) hours.\n\nNext, we calculate the distance driven in each half of the journey:\n- The distance driven at 28 miles per hour is \\(28 \\times 0.25 = 7\\) miles.\n- The distance driven at 60 miles per hour is \\(60 \\times 0.25 = 15\\) miles.\n\nNow, we add the distances from each half to find the total distance:\n\\[7 + 15 = 22\\] miles.\n\nFinally, we calculate the time it will take Jake to bike this distance.

        "To determine how many hours it will take Jake to bike to the water park, we first need to find the total distance from their house to the water park. We know that Jake's dad spends half of the journey driving 28 miles per hour and the other half driving 60 miles per hour, and the total time for the journey is 30 minutes.\n\nFirst, let's convert the total time from minutes to hours:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{30}{60} \\text{ hours} = 0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSince the journey is divided into two equal parts, the time spent on each part is:\n\\[ \\frac{0.5 \\text{ hours}}{2} = 0.25 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the distance for each part of the journey. For the first part, where Jake's dad drives at 28 miles per hour:\n\\[ \\text{Distance}_1 = 28 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 0.25 \\text{ hours} = 7 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nFor the second part, where Jake's dad drives at 60 miles per hour:\n\\[ \\text{Distance}_2 = 60 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 0.25 \\text{ hours} = 15 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThe total distance from their house to the water park is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Distance} = \\text{Distance}_1 + \\text{Distance}_2 = 7 \\text{ miles} + 15 \\text{ miles} = 22 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jake to bike this distance. Jake bikes at a speed of 11 miles per hour, so the time it will take him to bike 22 miles is:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{22 \\text{ miles}}{11 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jake \\(\\boxed{2}\\) hours to bike to the water park.",
        "To determine the total distance from Jake's house to the water park, we start by calculating the distance for each half of the journey. Since the entire journey takes 30 minutes, each half of the journey takes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we convert these times into hours because the speeds are given in miles per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 minutes is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{15}{60} = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the distance for each half of the journey. For the first half, the distance is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance}_1 = \\text{Speed}_1 \\times \\text{Time}_1 = 28 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ hours} = 7 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nFor the second half, the distance is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance}_2 = \\text{Speed}_2 \\times \\text{Time}_2 = 60 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ hours} = 15 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThe total distance from Jake's house to the water park is the sum of these two distances:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Distance} = \\text{Distance}_1 + \\text{Distance}_2 = 7 \\text{ miles} + 15 \\text{ miles} = 22 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it will take Jake to bike this distance. Since Jake bikes at a speed of 11 miles per hour, the time it takes him to bike 22 miles is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{22 \\text{ miles}}{11 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jake \\(\\boxed{2}\\) hours to bike to the water park.",
