        "To determine how many meters farther Hannah ran on Monday than on Wednesday and Friday combined, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the distance Hannah ran on Monday from kilometers to meters.\n2. Calculate the total distance Hannah ran on Wednesday and Friday.\n3. Subtract the total distance run on Wednesday and Friday from the distance run on Monday.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the distance Hannah ran on Monday from kilometers to meters.**\n\nHannah ran 9 kilometers on Monday. Since 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters, we convert kilometers to meters by multiplying by 1000:\n\n\\[ 9 \\text{ kilometers} = 9 \\times 1000 = 9000 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total distance Hannah ran on Wednesday and Friday.**\n\nHannah ran 4816 meters on Wednesday and 2095 meters on Friday. To find the total distance for Wednesday and Friday, we add these two distances together:\n\n\\[ 4816 \\text{ meters} + 2095 \\text{ meters} = 6911 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the total distance run on Wednesday and Friday from the distance run on Monday.**\n\nNow, we subtract the total distance run on Wednesday and Friday from the distance run on Monday:\n\n\\[ 9000 \\text{ meters} - 6911 \\text{ meters} = 2089 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nTherefore, Hannah ran \\(\\boxed{2089}\\) meters farther on Monday than on Wednesday and Friday combined.",
