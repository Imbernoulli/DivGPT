The second friend runs 3 miles in 24 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes for the second friend to run 1 mile is:\n\\[\n\\frac{24 \\text{ minutes}}{3 \\text{ miles}} = 8 \\text{ minutes per mile}\n\\]\nSo, the time it takes for the second friend to run 5 miles is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ miles} \\times 8 \\text{ minutes per mile} = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the times it takes for both friends to run 5 miles each:\n\\[\n35 \\text{ minutes} + 40 \\text{ minutes} = 75 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the combined time it will take for them to run 5 miles each is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{75}\n\\]"
