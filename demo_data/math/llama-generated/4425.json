        "To find the total value of all the treats DJ Snake received on his engagement day, we need to calculate the value of each treat and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Hotel Stay by Moksi:**\n   Moksi took DJ Snake and his fiancee to a luxurious hotel for two nights, with each night costing $4000.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of the hotel stay} = 2 \\times 4000 = 8000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Car by Lil Jon:**\n   Lil Jon bought them a car worth $30000.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value of the car} = 30000\n   \\]\n\n3. **House by Wynter:**\n   Wynter presented them with a house worth four times the value of the car Lil Jon bought them.
