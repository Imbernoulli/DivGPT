Each of these students received 2 stickers, so the total number of stickers given to these students is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ stickers/student} \\times x \\text{ students} = 2x \\text{ stickers} \\]\n\n Mary has 8 stickers left over after giving out all the stickers. Therefore, the total number of stickers given away plus the stickers left over should equal the total number of stickers she brought to class:\n\\[ 20 + 2x + 8 = 50 \\]\n\nWe simplify the equation:\n\\[ 28 + 2x = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( 2x \\) by subtracting 28 from both sides:\n\\[ 2x = 50 - 28 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 22 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ x = \\frac{22}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 11 \\]\n\nSo, there are 11 other students in the class. including Mary and her 5 friends, the total number of students in the class is:\n\\[ 11 + 5 + 1 = 17 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students in the class is:\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]",

Since Mary gave 2 stickers to each of these students, the total number of stickers given to the rest of the class is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ stickers/student} \\times (x - 6) = 2(x - 6) \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, after giving out all the stickers, Mary has 8 stickers left. Therefore, the total number of stickers she gave out is:\n\\[ 50 - 8 = 42 \\text{ stickers} \\]\n\nThis total is the sum of the stickers given to her 5 friends and the stickers given to the rest of the class:\n\\[ 20 + 2(x - 6) = 42 \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 20 + 2x - 12 = 42 \\]\n\\[ 8 + 2x = 42 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 42 - 8 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 34 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{34}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 17 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of students in the class, including Mary, is:\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]",

This means the total number of stickers she gave out plus the stickers she has left equals the total number of stickers she brought to class. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 20 + 2x - 12 = 50 - 8 \\]\nSimplifying the left side and the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 2x + 8 = 42 \\]\nSubtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 2x = 34 \\]\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\\[ x = 17 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of students in the class, including Mary, is:\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]",

Next, let's determine how many stickers she gave to the rest of the class.

Since she gave each of these students 2 stickers each, we can find the number of students who received these stickers by dividing the total number of stickers given to them by the number of stickers each student received:\n\n\\[ 22 \\div 2 = 11 \\]\n\nSo, there are 11 students who received stickers from Mary, in addition to her 5 friends and Mary herself.

Determine the total number of stickers Mary gave to the rest of the class.\n3. Use the information about the leftover stickers to find the total number of students in the class.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of stickers Mary gave to her 5 friends:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ stickers/friend} \\times 5 \\text{ friends} = 20 \\text{ stickers} \\]\n\nNext, let's denote the total number of students in the class, including Mary, by \\( x \\). Since Mary has already given stickers to her 5 friends, the number of students left to receive stickers is \\( x - 6 \\) ( subtracting Mary and her 5 friends from the total number of students). According to the problem, each of these students received 2 stickers each:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ stickers/student} \\times (x - 6) = 2(x - 6) \\text{ stickers} \\]\n\nThe total number of stickers given out is the sum of the stickers given to her 5 friends and the stickers given to the rest of the class:\n\\[ 20 + 2(x - 6) \\text{ stickers} \\]\n\nWe know that after giving out all the stickers, Mary has 8 stickers left over. Therefore, the total number of stickers given out plus the leftover stickers is equal to the initial number of stickers:\n\\[ 20 + 2(x - 6) + 8 = 50 \\]\n\nNow, let's simplify and solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 20 + 2x - 12 + 8 = 50 \\]\n\\[ 2x + 16 = 50 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 50 - 16 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 34 \\]\n\\[ x = 17 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of students in the class, including Mary, is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of students in the class, including Mary, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of stickers Mary gave to her 5 friends:**\n   Mary gave each of her 5 friends 4 stickers.\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 4 = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many stickers Mary has left after giving stickers to her friends:**\n   Mary initially had 50 stickers and gave away 20 stickers.\n   \\[\n   50 - 20 = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how many stickers Mary gave to the rest of the class:**\n   Mary has 8 stickers left after giving stickers to her friends and to everyone else. Therefore, she gave away:\n   \\[\n   30 - 8 = 22\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many students Mary gave stickers to, excluding her friends:**\n   Mary gave each student she gave stickers to 2 stickers.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{22}{2} = 11\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of students in the class:**\n   Mary has 5 friends and 11 other students, plus herself.\n   \\[\n   5 + 11 + 1 = 17\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of students in the class, including Mary, is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",

Calculate the total number of stickers Mary gave to her 5 friends.\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ stickers/friend} \\times 5 \\text{ friends} = 20 \\text{ stickers}\n   \\]\n\n2.

Mary gave each of these students 2 stickers.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ stickers/student} \\times x \\text{ students} = 2x \\text{ stickers}\n   \\]\n\n3. Mary has 8 stickers left over after giving stickers to her friends and the other students. The total number of stickers she started with is 50. Therefore, we can write the following equation to represent the total number of stickers given away and the stickers left over:\n   \\[\n   20 + 2x + 8 = 50\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n   \\[\n   28 + 2x = 50\n   \\]\n\n5. Isolate \\( 2x \\) by subtracting 28 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   2x = 22\n   \\]\n\n6. Solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = 11\n   \\]\n\n7. The total number of students in the class, including Mary, is the sum of Mary, her 5 friends, and the other 11 students:\n   \\[\n   1 + 5 + 11 = 17\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students in the class, including Mary, is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",

Therefore, the total number of stickers she started with (50) is equal to the sum of the stickers she gave out plus the stickers she has left over:\n\\[ 50 = 20 + (2x - 12) + 8 \\]\n\nSimplify the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 50 = 20 + 2x - 12 + 8 \\]\n\\[ 50 = 16 + 2x \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 50 - 16 = 2x \\]\n\\[ 34 = 2x \\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\\[ x = \\frac{34}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 17 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of students in the class, including Mary, is:\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]",

        "Let's start by calculating how many stickers Mary gave to her 5 friends. Since each friend received 4 stickers, the total number of stickers given to her friends is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, let's denote the number of other students in the class (excluding Mary and her 5 friends) as \\( x \\). Each of these students received 2 stickers, so the total number of stickers given to these students is:\n\\[ 2x \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, after giving out all the stickers, Mary has 8 stickers left over. Therefore, the total number of stickers she gave out plus the stickers she has left over should equal the total number of stickers she brought to class. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ 20 + 2x + 8 = 50 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 28 + 2x = 50 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we subtract 28 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2x = 22 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[ x = 11 \\]\n\nSo, there are 11 other students in the class. To find the total number of students in the class, including Mary, we add Mary, her 5 friends, and the other 11 students:\n\\[ 1 + 5 + 11 = 17 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students in the class is:\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]",
