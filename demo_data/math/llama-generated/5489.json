        "To determine the total number of crickets Gilbert will eat over 15 weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the number of crickets he eats at each temperature.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of weeks the temperature averages 90 degrees F and the number of weeks it averages 100 degrees F. Since the temperature averages 90 degrees F for 80% of the time, we have:\n\\[ 0.80 \\times 15 = 12 \\text{ weeks} \\]\nThis means that for 12 weeks, the temperature averages 90 degrees F.\n\nThe remaining 20% of the time, the temperature averages 100 degrees F, so we have:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 15 = 3 \\text{ weeks} \\]\nThis means that for 3 weeks, the temperature averages 100 degrees F.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of crickets Gilbert eats in the 12 weeks when the temperature averages 90 degrees F. Since he eats 4 crickets per week at this temperature, we have:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ crickets/week} \\times 12 \\text{ weeks} = 48 \\text{ crickets} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the number of crickets Gilbert eats in the 3 weeks when the temperature averages 100 degrees F. Since he eats twice as many crickets per week at this temperature, he eats:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ crickets/week} \\]\nSo, the total number of crickets he eats in these 3 weeks is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ crickets/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 24 \\text{ crickets} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of crickets eaten in the 12 weeks to the number of crickets eaten in the 3 weeks to get the total number of crickets eaten over the 15 weeks:\n\\[ 48 \\text{ crickets} + 24 \\text{ crickets} = 72 \\text{ crickets} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of crickets Gilbert will eat over 15 weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]",

Since the temperature averages 90 degrees F for 80% of the time, we have:\n\\[\n0.80 \\times 15 = 12 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\nThis means that for 12 weeks, the temperature averages 90 degrees F. The remaining time, which is 15 - 12 = 3 weeks, the temperature averages 100 degrees F.\n\nNext, calculate the number of crickets Gilbert eats in the weeks when the temperature averages 90 degrees F. Since he eats 4 crickets per week at this temperature, we have:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ crickets/week} \\times 12 \\text{ weeks} = 48 \\text{ crickets}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the number of crickets Gilbert eats in the weeks when the temperature averages 100 degrees F. Since he eats twice as many crickets per week at this temperature (which is 4 \\times 2 = 8 crickets per week), we have:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ crickets/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 24 \\text{ crickets}\n\\]\n\nFinally, add the number of crickets eaten in the two different periods to find the total number of crickets eaten over the 15 weeks:\n\\[\n48 \\text{ crickets} + 24 \\text{ crickets} = 72 \\text{ crickets}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of crickets Gilbert will eat over 15 weeks is \\boxed{72}.",
        "To determine how many crickets Gilbert will eat over 15 weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the number of crickets he eats at each temperature.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of weeks the temperature averages 90 degrees F and the number of weeks it averages 100 degrees F.

Over 3 weeks, he will eat:\n\n\\[\n8 \\text{ crickets/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 24 \\text{ crickets}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of crickets eaten at both temperatures to find the total number of crickets eaten over the 15 weeks:\n\n\\[\n48 \\text{ crickets} + 24 \\text{ crickets} = 72 \\text{ crickets}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of crickets Gilbert will eat over 15 weeks is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).",
