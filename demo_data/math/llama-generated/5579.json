        "To determine how many individuals were left at the zoo, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students present initially.\n2. Determine the total number of chaperones and teachers present initially.\n3. Subtract the number of students and chaperones who left the zoo.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students present initially.**\n\nThe first class has 10 students and the second class also has 10 students. Therefore, the total number of students is:\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of chaperones and teachers present initially.**\n\nThere are 5 parents who offered to be chaperones and 2 teachers. Therefore, the total number of chaperones and teachers is:\n\\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of students and chaperones who left the zoo.**\n\n10 students left the zoo, and 2 of the chaperones who left were parents. Therefore, the total number of individuals who left the zoo is:\n\\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \\]\n\nThe total number of individuals initially at the zoo is the sum of the students and the chaperones and teachers:\n\\[ 20 + 7 = 27 \\]\n\nAfter 12 individuals left, the number of individuals remaining at the zoo is:\n\\[ 27 - 12 = 15 \\]\n\nThus, the number of individuals left at the zoo is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]",
        "Let's start by determining the total number of individuals who initially went to the zoo. The first class has 10 students and the second class also has 10 students, so the total number of students is:\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of chaperones and teachers. There are 5 parents who offered to be chaperones and 2 teachers, so the total number of chaperones and teachers is:\n\\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of individuals who initially went to the zoo is:\n\\[ 20 + 7 = 27 \\]\n\nAfter the school day was over, 10 students left. So, the number of students remaining is:\n\\[ 20 - 10 = 10 \\]\n\nSimilarly, 2 of the chaperones who were parents left. So, the number of chaperones remaining is:\n\\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \\]\n\nThe number of teachers remained the same, which is 2. Therefore, the total number of individuals left at the zoo is:\n\\[ 10 + 3 + 2 = 15 \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]",

Subtract the number of students and chaperones who left.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students.**\nThe first class has 10 students, and the second class also has 10 students. Therefore, the total number of students is:\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of chaperones.**\nThere are 5 parents who offered to be chaperones. Therefore, the total number of chaperones is:\n\\[ 5 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total number of teachers.**\nThere are 2 teachers from both classes. Therefore, the total number of teachers is:\n\\[ 2 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the number of students and chaperones who left.**\n10 students left, and 2 of the chaperones who left were parents. Therefore, the total number of people who left is:\n\\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \\]\n\nThe total number of people at the zoo initially is the sum of the students, chaperones, and teachers:\n\\[ 20 + 5 + 2 = 27 \\]\n\nAfter 12 people left, the number of people remaining at the zoo is:\n\\[ 27 - 12 = 15 \\]\n\nThus, the number of individuals left at the zoo is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]",
        "To determine how many individuals were left at the zoo, we can break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of students:**\n   - The first class has 10 students.\n   - The second class also has 10 students.\n   - Therefore, the total number of students is \\(10 + 10 = 20\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of chaperones and teachers:**\n   - There are 5 parents who offered to be chaperones.\n   - There are 2 teachers from both classes.\n   - Therefore, the total number of chaperones and teachers is \\(5 + 2 = 7\\).\n\n3. **Determine the total number of individuals initially at the zoo:**\n   - The total number of individuals is the sum of the students and the chaperones and teachers, which is \\(20 + 7 = 27\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the number of individuals who left the zoo:**\n   - 10 students left the zoo.\n   - 2 of the chaperones who left were parents.\n   - Therefore, the total number of individuals who left is \\(10 + 2 = 12\\).\n\n5. **Determine the number of individuals left at the zoo:**\n   - The number of individuals left at the zoo is the initial total number of individuals minus the number of individuals who left, which is \\(27 - 12 = 15\\).\n\nThus, the number of individuals left at the zoo is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
