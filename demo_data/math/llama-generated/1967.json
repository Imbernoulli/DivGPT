        "To determine the original cost of the jeans before all the discounts, we need to work backwards from the final price after all discounts have been applied.\n\n1. **Final Price After All Discounts:**\n   The final price of the jeans after all discounts is $14.50.\n\n2. **Wednesday Discount:**\n   On Wednesdays, there is an additional $10.00 off after the summer discount. Let \\( P_s \\) be the price after the summer discount but before the Wednesday discount. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   P_s - 10 = 14.50\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( P_s \\):\n   \\[\n   P_s = 14.50 + 10 = 24.50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Summer Discount:**\n   The summer discount is 50% off the original price. Let \\( P_o \\) be the original price. Therefore, the price after the summer discount is half of the original price:\n   \\[\n   P_s = \\frac{P_o}{2}\n   \\]\n   We already found that \\( P_s = 24.50 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{P_o}{2} = 24.50\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( P_o \\):\n   \\[\n   P_o = 24.50 \\times 2 = 49\n   \\]\n\nThus, the original cost of the jeans before all the discounts was \\(\\boxed{49}\\).",
        "To determine the original cost of the jeans before any discounts, we need to work backwards from the given final cost. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Final Cost After All Discounts:**\n   The final cost of the jeans after all discounts is $14.50.\n\n2. **Wednesday Discount:**\n   On Wednesdays, there is an additional $10.00 off after the summer discount. Let \\( C \\) be the cost of the jeans after applying the summer discount but before the Wednesday discount. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   C - 10.00 = 14.50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( C \\):**\n   Add $10.00 to both sides of the equation to find \\( C \\):\n   \\[\n   C = 14.50 + 10.00 = 24.50\n   \\]\n   So, the cost of the jeans after the summer discount is $24.50.\n\n4. **Summer Discount:**\n   The summer discount is 50% off. Let \\( x \\) be the original cost of the jeans. The summer discount reduces the original cost to half:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{2} = 24.50\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to find \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 24.50 \\times 2 = 49.00\n   \\]\n   So, the original cost of the jeans before any discounts is $49.00.\n\nTherefore, the original cost for the jeans before all the discounts was \\(\\boxed{49}\\).",
        "To determine the original cost of the jeans before any discounts were applied, we need to work backwards from the final cost of $14.50.\n\n1. **Apply the Wednesday discount**: The problem states that there is an additional $10.00 off on all jeans on Wednesdays after the summer discount is applied.
