        "To determine the average minimum speed Andy needs to drive to reach Los Angeles in 11 hours, we start by calculating the total distance of the trip. The distance from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas is 420 miles, and the distance from Las Vegas to Los Angeles is 273 miles. Therefore, the total distance is:\n\n\\[ 420 + 273 = 693 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the average speed required to cover this distance in 11 hours. Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time. So, we divide 693 miles by 11 hours:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{693}{11} = 63 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nThus, the average minimum speed that Andy needs to drive to reach Los Angeles in 11 hours is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{63} \\]",
