        "First, we need to determine the temperature difference between the current temperature and 32 degrees. The current temperature is 8 degrees, so the difference is:\n\\[ 32 - 8 = 24 \\text{ degrees} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many 3-degree intervals are in 24 degrees. This is calculated by dividing 24 by 3:\n\\[ 24 \\div 3 = 8 \\]\n\nFor each 3-degree interval, Annie's chances of skidding on ice increase by 5%. Since there are 8 intervals, the total increase in her chances of skidding on ice is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 5\\% = 40\\% \\]\n\nThis means Annie has a 40% chance of skidding on ice. If she skids on ice, she has a 40% chance of regaining control, which means she has a 60% chance of having a serious accident.
