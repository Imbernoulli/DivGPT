        "To determine how many tortilla chips Nancy kept for herself, we start by calculating the total number of tortilla chips she gave away. Nancy gave 7 tortilla chips to her brother and 5 tortilla chips to her sister. Therefore, the total number of tortilla chips given away is:\n\n\\[7 + 5 = 12\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of tortilla chips given away from the original number of tortilla chips Nancy had. Nancy originally had 22 tortilla chips. So, the number of tortilla chips Nancy kept for herself is:\n\n\\[22 - 12 = 10\\]\n\nThus, the number of tortilla chips Nancy kept for herself is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
