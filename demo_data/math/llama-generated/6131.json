        "To determine how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of the drink per serving:**\n   - Iced tea: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) cup\n   - Lemonade: \\( 1 \\frac{1}{4} \\) cup\n\n   First, convert the mixed number \\( 1 \\frac{1}{4} \\) to an improper fraction:\n   \\[\n   1 \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1 \\times 4 + 1}{4} = \\frac{4 + 1}{4} = \\frac{5}{4}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, add the amounts of iced tea and lemonade together:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{1 + 5}{4} = \\frac{6}{4}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplify \\( \\frac{6}{4} \\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{6 \\div 2}{4 \\div 2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   So, each serving of the drink uses \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) cups.\n\n2. **Determine the total number of servings in the pitcher:**\n   - The pitcher contains 18 cups.\n   - Each serving is \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) cups.\n\n   To find the number of servings, divide the total amount of the drink by the amount per serving:\n   \\[\n   18 \\div \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal:\n   \\[\n   18 \\div \\frac{3}{2} = 18 \\times \\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   Perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   18 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{18 \\times 2}{3} = \\frac{36}{3} = 12\n   \\]\n\n   So, there are 12 servings in the pitcher.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade in the pitcher:**\n   - Each serving contains \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\) cups of lemonade.\n   - There are 12 servings.\n\n   Multiply the amount of lemonade per serving by the total number of servings:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times \\frac{5}{4}\n   \\]\n\n   Perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{12 \\times 5}{4} = \\frac{60}{4} = 15\n   \\]\n\n   So, there are 15 cups of lemonade in the pitcher.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]",

The recipe for one drink uses \\(1\\frac{1}{4}\\) cups of lemonade, which can be rewritten as an improper fraction:\n\n\\[1\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{5}{4}\\]\n\nSo, each drink contains \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\) cups of lemonade. Next, we need to find out how many drinks are in the pitcher. The total volume of the drink in the pitcher is 18 cups. Since each drink uses \\(\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\\) cups, we can determine the number of drinks by dividing the total volume of the drink by the volume of one drink:\n\n\\[\\text{Number of drinks} = \\frac{18}{\\frac{3}{2}} = 18 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 12\\]\n\nNow that we know there are 12 drinks in the pitcher, we can find out how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher by multiplying the number of drinks by the amount of lemonade in each drink:\n\n\\[\\text{Cups of lemonade} = 12 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = 12 \\times 1.25 = 15\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cups of lemonade in the pitcher is \\(\\boxed{15}\\)."
