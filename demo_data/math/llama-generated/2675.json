To find the sales tax, we multiply the total cost by 10% (or 0.10):\n   \\[\n   270 \\times 0.10 = 27\n   \\]\n\n3. To find the final amount paid, we add the sales tax to the total cost before tax:\n   \\[\n   270 + 27 = 297\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount John paid for everything is \\(\\boxed{297}\\).",
