        "To determine how many gemstones Binkie has on his collar, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of gemstones Frankie has:**\n   - We know Spaatz has 1 gemstone.\n   - Spaatz has two less than half as many gemstones as Frankie.\n   - Let \\( F \\) represent the number of gemstones Frankie has.\n   - According to the problem, \\( \\frac{F}{2} - 2 = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Solve for \\( F \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{F}{2} - 2 = 1\n   \\]\n   Add 2 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{F}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   F = 6\n   \\]\n   So, Frankie has 6 gemstones.\n\n3. **Determine the number of gemstones Binkie has:**\n   - Binkie has four times as many gemstones as Frankie.\n   - Since Frankie has 6 gemstones, Binkie has:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 6 = 24\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Binkie has \\(\\boxed{24}\\) gemstones on his collar.",
        "To determine the number of gemstones on Binkie's collar, we start by defining the number of gemstones on Frankie's collar as \\( F \\).\n\nGiven that Spaatz has 1 gemstone on her collar, we can set up the following equation based on the information that Spaatz has two less than half as many gemstones on her collar as does Frankie:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{2}F - 2\n\\]\nSince \\( S = 1 \\), we substitute this value into the equation:\n\\[\n1 = \\frac{1}{2}F - 2\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( F \\), we first add 2 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n1 + 2 = \\frac{1}{2}F\n\\]\n\\[\n3 = \\frac{1}{2}F\n\\]\nNext, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \\( F \\):\n\\[\nF = 3 \\times 2\n\\]\n\\[\nF = 6\n\\]\nSo, Frankie has 6 gemstones on her collar.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of gemstones on Binkie's collar.

This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{2}F - 2\n\\]\nWe know that Spaatz has 1 gemstone, so we can substitute \\( S = 1 \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n1 = \\frac{1}{2}F - 2\n\\]\nTo find \\( F \\), we first add 2 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n1 + 2 = \\frac{1}{2}F\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n3 = \\frac{1}{2}F\n\\]\nNext, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \\( F \\):\n\\[\nF = 3 \\times 2\n\\]\n\\[\nF = 6\n\\]\nSo, Frankie has 6 gemstones on his collar. Now, we need to find out how many gemstones Binkie has. The problem states that Binkie has four times as many gemstones on his collar as does Frankie. Therefore, the number of gemstones on Binkie's collar is:\n\\[\nB = 4 \\times F\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( F = 6 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[\nB = 4 \\times 6\n\\]\n\\[\nB = 24\n\\]\nThus, the number of gemstones on Binkie's collar is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
