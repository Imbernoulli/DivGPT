        "To determine the number of children on the airplane, we start by identifying the number of men and women. According to the problem, the number of men and women is equal, and there are 30 men.

Therefore, there are also 30 women.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of men and women:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ (men)} + 30 \\text{ (women)} = 60 \\text{ (men and women)} \\]\n\nTo find the number of children, we subtract the total number of men and women from the total number of passengers:\n\\[ 80 \\text{ (total passengers)} - 60 \\text{ (men and women)} = 20 \\text{ (children)} \\]\n\nThus, the number of children on the airplane is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
