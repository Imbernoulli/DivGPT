        "To determine the highest level of financial backing, let's denote the lowest level of financial backing as \\( x \\) dollars. According to the problem, each subsequent level is ten times as high as the previous one. Therefore, the second level of financial backing is \\( 10x \\) dollars, and the highest level of financial backing is \\( 100x \\) dollars.\n\nThe entrepreneur received two backers at the highest level, three backers at the second level, and ten backers at the lowest level. The total amount raised can be expressed as:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 100x + 3 \\cdot 10x + 10 \\cdot x\n\\]\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\\[\n200x + 30x + 10x = 240x\n\\]\nWe know that the total amount raised was $12000, so we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n240x = 12000\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 240:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{12000}{240} = 50\n\\]\nThe highest level of financial backing is \\( 100x \\), so we substitute \\( x = 50 \\) into the expression:\n\\[\n100x = 100 \\cdot 50 = 5000\n\\]\nTherefore, the highest level of financial backing is \\(\\boxed{5000}\\).",
        "To determine the highest level of financial backing, we start by defining the three different dollar amount levels. Let the lowest level of financial backing be \\( x \\) dollars. Since each level is ten times as high as the previous one, the second level is \\( 10x \\) dollars, and the highest level is \\( 100x \\) dollars.\n\nThe entrepreneur received two backers at the highest level, three backers at the second level, and ten backers at the lowest level. Therefore, the total amount of money raised can be expressed as:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 100x + 3 \\cdot 10x + 10 \\cdot x\n\\]\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\\[\n200x + 30x + 10x = 240x\n\\]\nWe know that the total amount raised is $12000, so we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n240x = 12000\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 240:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{12000}{240} = 50\n\\]\nThus, the lowest level of financial backing is $50. Since the highest level is ten times the lowest level, the highest level of financial backing is:\n\\[\n100x = 100 \\cdot 50 = 5000\n\\]\nTherefore, the highest level of financial backing is \\(\\boxed{5000}\\).",
