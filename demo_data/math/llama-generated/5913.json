        "To determine how many muffins Amy originally baked, we need to calculate the total number of muffins she brought to school from Monday to Friday and then add the number of muffins she has left on Saturday.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many muffins Amy brought each day:\n- On Monday, she brings 1 muffin.\n- On Tuesday, she brings 2 muffins.\n- On Wednesday, she brings 3 muffins.\n- On Thursday, she brings 4 muffins.\n- On Friday, she brings 5 muffins.\n\nNext, we sum the number of muffins brought each day:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 \\]\n\nWe can use the formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers, which is:\n\\[ \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of terms. In this case, \\( n = 5 \\):\n\\[ \\frac{5(5+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 6}{2} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\]\n\nSo, Amy brought a total of 15 muffins to school from Monday to Friday.\n\nWe know that on Saturday she has 7 muffins left. Therefore, the total number of muffins she originally baked is:\n\\[ 15 + 7 = 22 \\]\n\nThus, the number of muffins Amy originally baked is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",
        "Let's determine how many muffins Amy brings to school each day from Monday to Friday. On Monday, she brings 1 muffin, on Tuesday she brings 2 muffins, on Wednesday she brings 3 muffins, on Thursday she brings 4 muffins, and on Friday she brings 5 muffins. We can calculate the total number of muffins she brings to school over these five days as follows:\n\n\\[1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5\\]\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term \\(a\\) is 1, the last term \\(l\\) is 5, and the number of terms \\(n\\) is 5. The sum \\(S_n\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:\n\n\\[S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (a + l)\\]\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[S_5 = \\frac{5}{2} (1 + 5) = \\frac{5}{2} \\times 6 = 15\\]\n\nSo, Amy brings a total of 15 muffins to school from Monday to Friday. According to the problem, on Saturday she counts that there are 7 muffins left. Therefore, the total number of muffins she originally baked is the sum of the muffins she brought to school and the muffins she has left:\n\n\\[15 + 7 = 22\\]\n\nThus, the number of muffins Amy originally baked is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",

        "To determine how many muffins Amy originally baked, we first calculate the total number of muffins she brought to school from Monday to Friday. The number of muffins she brings each day forms an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 1 and the common difference is 1.\n\nThe number of muffins brought on each day is:\n- Monday: 1 muffin\n- Tuesday: 2 muffins\n- Wednesday: 3 muffins\n- Thursday: 4 muffins\n- Friday: 5 muffins\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d) \\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of terms, \\( a \\) is the first term, and \\( d \\) is the common difference. Here, \\( n = 5 \\), \\( a = 1 \\), and \\( d = 1 \\).\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[ S_5 = \\frac{5}{2} (2 \\cdot 1 + (5-1) \\cdot 1) = \\frac{5}{2} (2 + 4) = \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot 6 = 15 \\]\n\nSo, Amy brought a total of 15 muffins to school from Monday to Friday. According to the problem, after Saturday she has 7 muffins left. Therefore, the total number of muffins she originally baked is:\n\\[ 15 + 7 = 22 \\]\n\nThus, the number of muffins Amy originally baked is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",

Here, \\( n = 5 \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{5(5+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 6}{2} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n\\]\n\nSo, Amy brought a total of 15 muffins to school from Monday to Friday.\n\nWe know that on Saturday, she had 7 muffins left. Therefore, the total number of muffins she originally baked is the sum of the muffins she brought to school and the muffins she had left:\n\\[\n15 + 7 = 22\n\\]\n\nThus, Amy originally baked \\(\\boxed{22}\\) muffins.",
