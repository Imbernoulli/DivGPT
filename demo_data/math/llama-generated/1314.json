        "To determine how many girls have short hair, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of girls at the track meet.\n2. Determine how many of these girls have long hair.\n3. Subtract the number of girls with long hair from the total number of girls to find the number of girls with short hair.\n\nFirst, we find the number of girls at the track meet. Since there are 55 people in total and 30 of them are boys, the number of girls is:\n\\[ 55 - 30 = 25 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many of these girls have long hair. According to the problem, three fifths of the girls have long hair. Therefore, the number of girls with long hair is:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{5} \\times 25 = \\frac{3 \\times 25}{5} = \\frac{75}{5} = 15 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of girls with long hair from the total number of girls to find the number of girls with short hair:\n\\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the number of girls with short hair is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
