        "To determine the total cost of 5 mani/pedis with the Mother's Day special, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discounted price of one mani/pedi.\n2. Multiply the discounted price by the number of mani/pedis.\n\nFirst, let's find the discounted price of one mani/pedi. The regular price is $40.00, and there is a 25% discount. The discount amount is calculated as follows:\n\\[ 40.00 \\times 0.25 = 10.00 \\]\nSo, the discounted price of one mani/pedi is:\n\\[ 40.00 - 10.00 = 30.00 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total cost for 5 mani/pedis at the discounted price:\n\\[ 30.00 \\times 5 = 150.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Charlotte will spend on 5 mani/pedis is:\n\\[ \\boxed{150.00} \\]",

Determine the discounted price of one mani/pedi.\n3. Calculate the total cost for 5 mani/pedis at the discounted price.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discount on one mani/pedi. The regular price is $40.00 and the discount is 25%. Therefore, the discount amount is:\n\\[ 40.00 \\times \\frac{25}{100} = 40.00 \\times 0.25 = 10.00 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the discount from the regular price to find the discounted price of one mani/pedi:\n\\[ 40.00 - 10.00 = 30.00 \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total cost for 5 mani/pedis at the discounted price:\n\\[ 5 \\times 30.00 = 150.00 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount Charlotte will spend on 5 mani/pedis is:\n\\[ \\boxed{150.00} \\]",
