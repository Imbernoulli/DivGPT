Let's denote the number of drums she hit by \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we know that the cost to enter the contest is $10. She earns money only if she hits more than 200 drums. For each drum hit above 200, she earns 2.5 cents, which is equivalent to $0.025.\n\nIf she hits \\( x \\) drums, the number of drums above 200 is \\( x - 200 \\). Therefore, her earnings from hitting drums above 200 is \\( 0.025(x - 200) \\) dollars.\n\nAccording to the problem, Juanita lost $7.5 for joining the contest. This means her total earnings after paying the entry fee is $10 - $7.5 = $2.5. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 0.025(x - 200) = 2.5 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first divide both sides of the equation by 0.025:\n\n\\[ x - 200 = \\frac{2.5}{0.025} \\]\n\nNext, we perform the division on the right side:\n\n\\[ x - 200 = 100 \\]\n\nThen, we add 200 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ x = 100 + 200 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 300 \\]\n\nTherefore, Juanita hit \\(\\boxed{300}\\) drums.",

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Cost**: Juanita pays $10 to enter the contest.\n2. **Money Earned**: Juanita earns $0.025 (which is 2.5 cents) for each drum hit over 200 drums.\n3. **Net yy**: Juanita lost $7.5 after joining the contest.\n\nLet's denote the total number of drums Juanita hit as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate how much money Juanita earns from hitting the drums. Since she earns money only for the drums hit over 200, the number of drums that contribute to her earnings is \\( x - 200 \\). Therefore, her earnings are:\n\\[ 0.025 \\times (x - 200) \\]\n\nNext, we set up an equation to represent her net profit (or loss). Her net profit is her earnings minus the initial cost:\n\\[ 0.025 \\times (x - 200) - 10 = -7.5 \\]\n\nNow, we solve this equation step by step:\n\\[ 0.025 \\times (x - 200) - 10 = -7.5 \\]\n\\[ 0.025 \\times (x - 200) = -7.5 + 10 \\]\n\\[ 0.025 \\times (x - 200) = 2.5 \\]\n\\[ x - 200 = \\frac{2.5}{0.025} \\]\n\\[ x - 200 = 100 \\]\n\\[ x = 100 + 200 \\]\n\\[ x = 300 \\]\n\nSo, Juanita hit \\(\\boxed{300}\\) drums.",
        "To determine how many drums Juanita hit, we start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Juanita pays $10 to enter the contest and makes money only if she hits more than 200 drums. For every drum hit beyond 200, she earns 2.5 cents, which is $0.025.\n\nLet's denote the total number of drums Juanita hit as \\( x \\). Since she loses $7.50 after joining the contest, she earns less than $10 by $7.50. This means her earnings are:\n\n\\[ 10 - 7.5 = 2.5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nIf \\( x \\) is the total number of drums hit, then the number of drums beyond 200 is \\( x - 200 \\). The earnings from hitting these additional drums is \\( (x - 200) \\times 0.025 \\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ (x - 200) \\times 0.025 = 2.5 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first divide both sides of the equation by 0.025:\n\n\\[ x - 200 = \\frac{2.5}{0.025} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the division on the right side:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2.5}{0.025} = 100 \\]\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ x - 200 = 100 \\]\n\nAdding 200 to both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ x = 300 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of drums Juanita hit is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
        "To determine how many drums Juanita hit, we start by calculating how much she earned in the contest. Since she lost $7.5, her net earnings are $10 - $7.5 = $2.5. According to the problem, she earns 2.5 cents for every drum hit after hitting 200 drums. First, we convert her net earnings from dollars to cents: $2.5 = 2.5 * 100 = 250 cents.\n\nNext, we set up an equation to find the number of drums she hit. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of drums she hit. The number of drums beyond 200 is \\( x - 200 \\). Since she earns 2.5 cents for each of these additional drums, her total earnings from these drums is \\( 2.5(x - 200) \\) cents. We know this amount is equal to 250 cents, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ 2.5(x - 200) = 250. \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first divide both sides of the equation by 2.5:\n\\[ x - 200 = \\frac{250}{2.5} = 100. \\]\n\nThen, we add 200 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 100 + 200 = 300. \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of drums Juanita hit is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",

Therefore, we can set up the equation for her net earnings as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Net earnings} = \\text{Earnings from drums} - \\text{Cost of entering} \\]\nSince she loses $7.5, her net earnings are -$7.5. So we have:\n\\[ -7.5 = \\text{Earnings from drums} - 10 \\]\n\nNext, we need to express her earnings from hitting drums. She earns 2.5 cents for each drum hit beyond 200 drums. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of drums she hits. Then the number of drums beyond 200 is \\( x - 200 \\). Since 2.5 cents is equivalent to $0.025, her earnings from hitting drums are:\n\\[ \\text{Earnings from drums} = 0.025 \\times (x - 200) \\]\n\nSubstituting this into our net earnings equation, we get:\n\\[ -7.5 = 0.025 \\times (x - 200) - 10 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ -7.5 + 10 = 0.025 \\times (x - 200) \\]\n\\[ 2.5 = 0.025 \\times (x - 200) \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 0.025:\n\\[ \\frac{2.5}{0.025} = x - 200 \\]\n\\[ 100 = x - 200 \\]\n\nFinally, we add 200 to both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 100 + 200 = x \\]\n\\[ x = 300 \\]\n\nTherefore, Juanita hit \\(\\boxed{300}\\) drums.",

        "To determine how many drums Juanita hit, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.\n\nFirst, we know the cost to enter the contest is $10. Juanita loses $7.5 for joining the contest, which means she ends up with a net loss of $7.5. Therefore, her total earnings from hitting drums must be $10 - $7.5 = $2.5.\n\nNext, we know that Juanita earns 2.5 cents for every drum hit after she hits 200 drums. Since 2.5 cents is equal to $0.025, her earnings from hitting drums can be expressed as $0.025 \\times (x - 200)$, where \\( x \\) is the total number of drums she hits.\n\nWe can now set up the equation:\n\\[ 0.025 \\times (x - 200) = 2.5 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first divide both sides of the equation by 0.025:\n\\[ x - 200 = \\frac{2.5}{0.025} \\]\n\\[ x - 200 = 100 \\]\n\nNext, we add 200 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 100 + 200 \\]\n\\[ x = 300 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of drums Juanita hit is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
        "To determine how many drums Juanita hit, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the total number of drums Juanita hit. According to the problem, if she hits 200 drums, she starts to make money at a rate of 2.5 cents per drum hit. Therefore, the number of drums she hits above 200 is \\( x - 200 \\).\n\nThe money she earns from hitting the drums is given by:\n\\[ 0.025 \\times (x - 200) \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince she pays $10 to enter the contest, her net profit (or loss) is:\n\\[ 0.025 \\times (x - 200) - 10 \\]\n\nWe know from the problem that she lost $7.5, so her net profit is $-7.5. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 0.025 \\times (x - 200) - 10 = -7.5 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 0.025 \\times (x - 200) - 10 = -7.5 \\]\n\\[ 0.025 \\times (x - 200) = -7.5 + 10 \\]\n\\[ 0.025 \\times (x - 200) = 2.5 \\]\n\\[ x - 200 = \\frac{2.5}{0.025} \\]\n\\[ x - 200 = 100 \\]\n\\[ x = 100 + 200 \\]\n\\[ x = 300 \\]\n\nSo, Juanita hit \\(\\boxed{300}\\) drums.",
        "To determine how many drums Juanita hit if she lost $7.5 for joining the contest, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total cost of entering the contest, which is $10.\n2. Determine how much money Juanita earns for hitting drums. She earns 2.5 cents for each drum hit after hitting 200 drums. Since 2.5 cents is equivalent to $0.025, the earnings can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings} = 0.025 \\times (\\text{Number of drums hit} - 200)\n   \\]\n3. The net profit or loss is the earnings minus the entry fee. According to the problem, Juanita lost $7.5, so we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings} - 10 = -7.5\n   \\]\n4. Substitute the expression for earnings into the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.025 \\times (\\text{Number of drums hit} - 200) - 10 = -7.5\n   \\]\n5. Simplify the equation by isolating the term involving the number of drums hit:\n   \\[\n   0.025 \\times (\\text{Number of drums hit} - 200) = 2.5\n   \\]\n6. Divide both sides of the equation by 0.025:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of drums hit} - 200 = 100\n   \\]\n7. Add 200 to both sides of the equation to solve for the number of drums hit:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of drums hit} = 300\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of drums Juanita hit is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
        "To determine how many drums Juanita hit, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of drums Juanita hit as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we know that the cost to enter the contest is $10. If Juanita hits 200 drums, she starts to make money at a rate of 2.5 cents per drum hit. Since 2.5 cents is equivalent to $0.025, her earnings from hitting drums can be expressed as \\( 0.025(x - 200) \\) dollars, because she only starts earning money after hitting 200 drums.\n\nThe total amount of money Juanita has after joining the contest is her earnings minus the entry fee. According to the problem, she lost $7.5, which means her total amount of money is $10 - $7.5 = $2.5. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 0.025(x - 200) = 2.5 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\). First, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.025:\n\n\\[ x - 200 = \\frac{2.5}{0.025} \\]\n\nCalculating the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ x - 200 = 100 \\]\n\nThen, we add 200 to both sides to isolate \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 100 + 200 \\]\n\\[ x = 300 \\]\n\nSo, the number of drums Juanita hit is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",

Since she earns 2.5 cents for each of these extra drums, her earnings from the extra drums are \\( 0.025(x - 200) \\) dollars. Therefore, her total earnings are:\n\n\\[ 0.025(x - 200) - 10 \\]\n\nWe know that Juanita lost $7.5, which means her total earnings are $7.5 less than $0. So we set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 0.025(x - 200) - 10 = -7.5 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\):\n\n1. Add 10 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 0.025(x - 200) = 2.5 \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 0.025:\n\n\\[ x - 200 = \\frac{2.5}{0.025} \\]\n\n3. Simplify the right side:\n\n\\[ x - 200 = 100 \\]\n\n4. Add 200 to both sides:\n\n\\[ x = 300 \\]\n\nSo, Juanita hit \\(\\boxed{300}\\) drums.",
        "To determine how many drums Juanita hit, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.\n\n1. **Identify the cost to enter the contest and the earnings per drum hit:**\n   -cription cost: $10\n   -Earnings per drum hit: $0.025 per drum hit\n\n2. **Determine the condition for starting to earn money:**\n   - Juanita starts earning money only if she hits 200 drums.\n\n3. **Set up the equation for her total earnings:**\n   - If \\( x \\) is the total number of drums hit, then the number of drums hit beyond 200 is \\( x - 200 \\).\n   - Earnings for the drums hit beyond 200 is \\( 0.025(x - 200) \\).\n\n4. **Calculate her net profit/loss:**\n   - Her net profit/loss is the earnings minus the Devices cost.\n   - According to the problem, she lost $7.5, so her net profit/loss is \\( -7.5 \\).\n\n5. **Set up the equation based on her net profit/loss:**\n   \\[\n   0.025(x - 200) - 10 = -7.5\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve the equation:**\n   - First, add 10 to both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     0.025(x - 200) = 2.5\n     \\]\n   - Next, divide both sides by 0.025:\n     \\[\n     x - 200 = \\frac{2.5}{0.025}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the division:\n     \\[\n     x - 200 = 100\n     \\]\n   - Finally, add 200 to both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 300\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Juanita hit \\(\\boxed{300}\\) drums.",
        "To determine how many drums Juanita hit, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Cost**: Juanita pays $10 to enter the contest.\n\n2. **Money Earned**: Juanita earns 2.5 cents for each drum hit after she hits 200 drums. First, we need to convert the earnings from cents to dollars.
