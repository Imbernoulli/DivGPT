This requires us to divide the total number of students by the number of benches and round up to the nearest whole number (since we can't have a fraction of a student on a bench):\n\\[ \\text{Minimum number of students per bench} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{145}{29} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 5 \\right\\rceil = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of students that can sit on each bench for all the students to fit in the hall is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

Determine the minimum number of students per bench.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of female students. According to the problem, the number of female students is 4 times the number of male students. Since there are 29 male students, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of female students} = 4 \\times 29 = 116\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of students by adding the number of male students and the number of female students:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of students} = 29 + 116 = 145\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the minimum number of students per bench so that all 145 students can fit on the 29 benches. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of benches and rounding up to the nearest whole number (since we can't have a fraction of a student):\n\\[\n\\text{Minimum number of students per bench} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{145}{29} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 5 \\right\\rceil = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of students that can sit on each bench for all the students to fit in the hall is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
