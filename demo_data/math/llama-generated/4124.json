Use the information about Amy's speed to find out how long it took her to finish the race.\n\nFirst, we know that Patrick finished the race in 60 seconds. Manu took 12 more seconds than Patrick to finish the race. Therefore, we can calculate the time it took Manu to finish the race as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Time taken by Manu} = 60 + 12 = 72 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Amy is twice as fast as Manu. Since speed is the inverse of time (for a given distance), Amy will take half the time that Manu took to finish the race. Therefore, we can calculate the time it took Amy to finish the race as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Time taken by Amy} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nThus, the time it took Amy to finish the race is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
