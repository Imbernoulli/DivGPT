One trail is 20 miles and mostly downhill, so James can cover it at 5 miles per hour. The other trail is 12 miles, but it's mostly uphill, so James will only be able to cover 3 miles per hour and will have to take an hour break halfway through. How many hours faster is the fastest hike?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
