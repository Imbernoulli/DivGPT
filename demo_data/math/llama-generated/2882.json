        "To determine the number of seats taken for the school play, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of seats available.\n2. Subtract the number of unoccupied seats from the total number of seats.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of seats available. There are 40 rows of chairs, and each row contains 20 chairs.

To find the number of seats that were taken, we subtract the number of unoccupied seats from the total number of seats:\n\n\\[\n800 \\text{ chairs} - 10 \\text{ unoccupied seats} = 790 \\text{ seats taken}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of seats that were taken is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{790}\n\\]",
