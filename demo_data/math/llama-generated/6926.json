Determine how much Milton the mouse eats per day.\n3. Calculate how much Elmer the elephant eats per day.\n4. Find the difference between how much Elmer the elephant eats and how much Penelope the pig eats.\n\nFirst, we know that Penelope the pig eats 20 pounds of food per day, which is 10 times more than Greta the goose eats per day. Therefore, we can calculate how much Greta the goose eats per day as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Greta's daily food consumption} = \\frac{20}{10} = 2 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Milton the mouse eats 1/100 as much as Greta the goose eats per day. Therefore, we can calculate how much Milton the mouse eats per day as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Milton's daily food consumption} = \\frac{2}{100} = 0.02 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThen, we know that Elmer the elephant eats 4000 times more than Milton the mouse does per day. Therefore, we can calculate how much Elmer the elephant eats per day as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Elmer's daily food consumption} = 0.02 \\times 4000 = 80 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we need to find the difference between how much Elmer the elephant eats and how much Penelope the pig eats:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 80 - 20 = 60 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThus, Elmer the elephant eats \\(\\boxed{60}\\) pounds more per day than Penelope the pig.",
