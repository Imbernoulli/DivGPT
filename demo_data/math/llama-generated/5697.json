        "To determine how many customers will go home without any fish, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of tuna available.\n2. Determine the total amount of tuna required by the customers.\n3. Find out how many customers can be served with the available tuna.\n4. Calculate the number of customers who will go home without any fish.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of tuna available.**\n\nMr. Ray has 10 tuna, and each tuna weighs 200 pounds.\n\\[\n10 \\text{ tuna} \\times 200 \\text{ pounds/tuna} = 2000 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total amount of tuna required by the customers.**\n\nEach customer wants 25 pounds of tuna, and there are 100 customers.\n\\[\n100 \\text{ customers} \\times 25 \\text{ pounds/customer} = 2500 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many customers can be served with the available tuna.**\n\nWe have 2000 pounds of tuna, and each customer requires 25 pounds.\n\\[\n\\frac{2000 \\text{ pounds}}{25 \\text{ pounds/customer}} = 80 \\text{ customers}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of customers who will go home without any fish.**\n\nThere are 100 customers in total, and only 80 can be served.\n\\[\n100 \\text{ customers} - 80 \\text{ customers} = 20 \\text{ customers}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of customers who will go home without any fish is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
        "To determine how many customers will go home without any fish, we need to calculate the total amount of tuna available and then see how many customers can be served with that amount of tuna.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total weight of tuna Mr. Ray has. He has 10 tuna, each weighing 200 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of tuna is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 200 = 2000 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many customers can be served with 2000 pounds of tuna. Each customer wants 25 pounds of tuna. So, the number of customers that can be served is:\n\\[ \\frac{2000}{25} = 80 \\text{ customers} \\]\n\nSince Mr. Ray has 100 customers and only 80 can be served, the number of customers who will go home without any fish is:\n\\[ 100 - 80 = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the number of customers who will go home without any fish is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
        "To determine how many customers will go home without any fish, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of tuna available:**\n   Mr. Ray has 10 tuna, and each tuna weighs 200 pounds.

Compare the total weight of tuna available to the total weight of tuna required.\n   The total weight of tuna available is 2000 pounds, and the total weight of tuna required is 2500 pounds. Since 2000 pounds is less than 2500 pounds, not all customers will get their desired amount of tuna.\n\n5. Find out how many customers will go home without any fish.\n   To find out how many customers will go home without any fish, we need to determine how many customers can be served with the available tuna. Since each customer wants 25 pounds of tuna, we divide the total weight of tuna available by the weight of tuna each customer wants.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2000 \\text{ pounds}}{25 \\text{ pounds/customer}} = 80 \\text{ customers}\n   \\]\n   So, 80 customers can be served. Since there are 100 customers in total, the number of customers who will go home without any fish is:\n   \\[\n   100 \\text{ customers} - 80 \\text{ customers} = 20 \\text{ customers}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of customers who will go home without any fish is \\boxed{20}.",

Subtract the number of customers served from the total number of customers to find out how many will go home without any fish.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of tuna available.**\n\nMr. Ray has 10 tuna, and each tuna weighs 200 pounds.\n\\[\n10 \\text{ tuna} \\times 200 \\text{ pounds/tuna} = 2000 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total weight of tuna required by all customers.**\n\nEach customer wants 25 pounds of tuna, and there are 100 customers.\n\\[\n100 \\text{ customers} \\times 25 \\text{ pounds/customer} = 2500 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many customers can be served with the available tuna.**\n\nWe need to divide the total weight of tuna available by the weight each customer wants.\n\\[\n2000 \\text{ pounds} \\div 25 \\text{ pounds/customer} = 80 \\text{ customers}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the number of customers served from the total number of customers to find out how many will go home without any fish.**\n\nThere are 100 customers in total, and 80 customers can be served.\n\\[\n100 \\text{ customers} - 80 \\text{ customers} = 20 \\text{ customers}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of customers who will go home without any fish is \\boxed{20}.",
        "To determine how many customers will go home without any fish, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of tuna available.\n2. Determine how much tuna each customer wants.\n3. Calculate how many customers can be served with the available tuna.\n4. Subtract the number of customers served from the total number of customers to find out how many will go home without any fish.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of tuna available. Mr. Ray has 10 tuna, each weighing 200 pounds:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ tuna} \\times 200 \\text{ pounds per tuna} = 2000 \\text{ pounds of tuna}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much tuna each customer wants. Each customer wants 25 pounds of tuna.\n\nNow, we calculate how many customers can be served with the available tuna. We do this by dividing the total amount of tuna by the amount each customer wants:\n\\[\n2000 \\text{ pounds of tuna} \\div 25 \\text{ pounds per customer} = 80 \\text{ customers}\n\\]\n\nMr. Ray has 100 customers, so the number of customers who will go home without any fish is:\n\\[\n100 \\text{ customers} - 80 \\text{ customers} = 20 \\text{ customers}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of customers who will go home without any fish is \\boxed{20}."
