        "To determine how many more females with spots there are than males with horns, we start by defining the number of male and female cows. Let \\( m \\) be the number of male cows and \\( f \\) be the number of female cows. According to the problem, there are twice as many females as males, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ f = 2m \\]\n\nWe also know the total number of cows is 300, so we can write:\n\n\\[ m + f = 300 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( f = 2m \\) into the total number of cows equation, we get:\n\n\\[ m + 2m = 300 \\]\n\\[ 3m = 300 \\]\n\\[ m = 100 \\]\n\nNow that we know there are 100 male cows, we can find the number of female cows:\n\n\\[ f = 2m = 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many females have spots and how many males have horns. According to the problem, half the females are spotted, so the number of females with spots is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{f}{2} = \\frac{200}{2} = 100 \\]\n\nAnd half the males have horns, so the number of males with horns is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{m}{2} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\]\n\nTo find out how many more females with spots there are than males with horns, we subtract the number of males with horns from the number of females with spots:\n\n\\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are \\(\\boxed{50}\\) more females with spots than males with horns.",
