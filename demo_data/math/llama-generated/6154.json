        "To determine how many miles Marcus' car has on it after the road trip, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled and then add that distance to the original mileage.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of gas Marcus used during the trip. Since Marcus filled his empty gas tank twice and each tank holds 20 gallons of gas, the total amount of gas used is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total distance Marcus traveled using the gas. Since his car gets 30 miles per gallon, the total distance traveled is:\n\\[ 40 \\times 30 = 1200 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNow, we add the distance traveled to the original mileage to find the current mileage on the car:\n\\[ 1728 + 1200 = 2928 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of miles Marcus' car has on it now is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2928} \\]",
