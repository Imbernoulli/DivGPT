        "To determine how far a monkey will swing in 30 minutes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the time from minutes to seconds, since the speed is given in meters per second.\n2. Use the speed to calculate the distance.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, 30 minutes is equal to:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} = 1800 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, we use the formula for distance, which is:\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nThe speed of the monkey is 1.2 meters per second, and the time is 1800 seconds. So, we substitute these values into the formula:\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 1.2 \\text{ meters/second} \\times 1800 \\text{ seconds} = 2160 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance the monkey will swing in 30 minutes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2160} \\]",
