        "To determine the total number of apples produced by the apple tree over the first three years, we will calculate the production for each year and then sum these values.\n\n1. **First Year:**\n   The apple tree produces 40 apples.\n\n2. **Second Year:**\n   The tree produces 8 more than double the amount of apples it produced in the first year. First, we calculate double the first year's production:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 40 = 80\n   \\]\n   Then, we add 8 to this amount:\n   \\[\n   80 + 8 = 88\n   \\]\n   So, the tree produces 88 apples in the second year.\n\n3. **Third Year:**\n   The tree's production goes down by a fourth due to an insect infestation. First, we calculate a fourth of the second year's production:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{88}{4} = 22\n   \\]\n   Then, we subtract this amount from the second year's production:\n   \\[\n   88 - 22 = 66\n   \\]\n   So, the tree produces 66 apples in the third year.\n\n4. **Total Production Over Three Years:**\n   We sum the production from each year:\n   \\[\n   40 + 88 + 66 = 194\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of apples produced by the tree in the first three years is \\(\\boxed{194}\\).",
