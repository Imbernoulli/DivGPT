        "To determine the total number of months Gerald spends in jail, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total sentence before the extension.\n2. Apply the extension to the total sentence.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total sentence before the extension:\n\n- Gerald is sentenced to 3 months for assault.\n- Gerald is sentenced to 2 years for poisoning.\n\nSince there are 12 months in a year, we convert the 2 years into months:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ years} = 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nNow, we add the sentences for assault and poisoning:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ months} + 24 \\text{ months} = 27 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nNext, we apply the extension. The judge extends Gerald's sentence by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) because this is his third offense.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we convert the 2 years into months:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ years} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 24 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nNow, we add the sentence for assault to the sentence for poisoning:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ months} + 24 \\text{ months} = 27 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the extension of the sentence. The judge extends the sentence by 1/3 since this is Gerald's third offense. We calculate 1/3 of 27 months:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 27 \\text{ months} = 9 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the extension to the original sentence:\n\\[ 27 \\text{ months} + 9 \\text{ months} = 36 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of months Gerald spends in jail is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
