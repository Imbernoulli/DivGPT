Therefore, the number of pixels along the width is:\n\\[\n21 \\text{ inches} \\times 100 \\text{ pixels per inch} = 2100 \\text{ pixels}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of pixels along the height. The height of the monitor is 12 inches, and there are 100 dots (or pixels) per inch. Therefore, the number of pixels along the height is:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ inches} \\times 100 \\text{ pixels per inch} = 1200 \\text{ pixels}\n\\]\n\nNow, we multiply the number of pixels along the width by the number of pixels along the height to find the total number of pixels on the monitor:\n\\[\n2100 \\text{ pixels} \\times 1200 \\text{ pixels} = 2520000 \\text{ pixels}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of pixels on the monitor is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2520000}\n\\]",
