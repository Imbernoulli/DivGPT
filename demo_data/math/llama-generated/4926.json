        "To determine the length of Carmen's brush in centimeters, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the length of Carmen's brush in inches.\n2. Convert the length from inches to centimeters.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the length of Carmen's brush in inches.**\n\nCarla's brush is 12 inches long. Carmen's brush is 50% longer than Carla's brush. To find out how long Carmen's brush is, we need to calculate 50% of 12 inches and then add that to the original length of Carla's brush.\n\nFirst, calculate 50% of 12 inches:\n\\[ 50\\% \\text{ of } 12 = 0.50 \\times 12 = 6 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNow, add this to the original length of Carla's brush:\n\\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nSo, Carmen's brush is 18 inches long.\n\n**Step 2: Convert the length from inches to centimeters.**\n\nThere are 2.5 centimeters per inch. To convert 18 inches to centimeters, we multiply 18 by 2.5:\n\\[ 18 \\times 2.5 = 45 \\text{ centimeters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of Carmen's brush in centimeters is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
