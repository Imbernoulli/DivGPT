        "To determine the total number of turtles that Trey, Kris, and Kristen have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many turtles Kristen has.\n2. Use the information given to find out how many turtles Kris has.\n3. Use the information given to find out how many turtles Trey has.\n4. Add the number of turtles each person has to get the total.\n\nFirst, we know that Kristen has 12 turtles.\n\nNext, we know that Kris has one fourth the number of turtles Kristen has. Therefore, we can calculate the number of turtles Kris has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of turtles Kris has} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3\n\\]\n\nThen, we know that Trey has 5 times as many turtles as Kris. Therefore, we can calculate the number of turtles Trey has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of turtles Trey has} = 5 \\times 3 = 15\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of turtles each person has to find the total number of turtles:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of turtles} = \\text{Number of turtles Kristen has} + \\text{Number of turtles Kris has} + \\text{Number of turtles Trey has} = 12 + 3 + 15 = 30\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of turtles is \\boxed{30}.",
