        "To determine the total cost Ruby pays for taking 13 dance classes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the initial 10 classes:**\n   The pack of 10 classes costs $75.\n\n2. **Determine the cost of one class within the pack:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per class} = \\frac{75}{10} = 7.5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of each additional class:**\n   Ruby can add additional classes at the price of \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) of the average price of a class in the pack.
