        "To determine how many doubles baseball cards Jess has, we first need to find out how many doubles Rob has. According to the problem, one third of Rob's 24 baseball cards are doubles. Therefore, we calculate the number of doubles Rob has as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of doubles Rob has} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 24 = 8\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many doubles Jess has. The problem states that Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob. Therefore, we calculate the number of doubles Jess has as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of doubles Jess has} = 5 \\times 8 = 40\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of doubles baseball cards Jess has is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
        "To determine how many doubles baseball cards Jess has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of doubles Rob has.\n2. Determine how many doubles Jess has based on the number of doubles Rob has.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many doubles Rob has. According to the problem, one third of Rob's cards are doubles. Rob has 24 baseball cards in total. Therefore, the number of doubles Rob has is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 24 = 8\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many doubles Jess has.
