        "To determine how much Angie paid in taxes this month, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Angie's total monthly income.\n2. Subtract her contributions for necessities from her total income.\n3. Subtract the amount she had left over at the end of the month from the remaining amount after contributions.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Angie's total monthly income is $80.\n2. She contributes $42 a month for necessities. So, after contributing for necessities, the remaining amount is:\n   \\[\n   80 - 42 = 38\n   \\]\n3. At the end of the month, she had $18 left over.

        "To determine how much Angie paid in taxes this month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Angie's total monthly expenses.\n2. Subtract her total monthly expenses from her salary to find out how much she had left over.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Angie's total monthly expenses. She contributes $42 for necessities and pays a share of the household taxes. Let's denote the amount she pays in taxes as \\( T \\). Therefore, her total monthly expenses are:\n\\[ 42 + T \\]\n\nNext, we know that after paying her expenses, Angie has $18 left over. Her salary is $80. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 80 - (42 + T) = 18 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( T \\). First, simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 80 - 42 - T = 18 \\]\n\\[ 38 - T = 18 \\]\n\nNext, isolate \\( T \\) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 38 - 18 = T \\]\n\\[ T = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, Angie paid \\(\\boxed{20}\\) dollars in taxes this month.",
        "To determine how much Angie paid in taxes this month, we need to consider her total expenses and her remaining money. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify Angie's total monthly income: $80.\n2. Identify Angie's monthly contribution to necessities: $42.\n3. Identify the amount of money Angie had left over at the end of the month: $18.\n4. Let \\( T \\) be the amount of money Angie paid in taxes this month.\n\nFirst, we calculate Angie's total expenses for the month. Her total expenses include her contribution to necessities and her contribution to taxes:\n\\[ \\text{Total expenses} = 42 + T \\]\n\nNext, we know that after paying her expenses, Angie had $18 left over. Therefore, her total income minus her total expenses equals the amount of money she had left over:\n\\[ 80 - (42 + T) = 18 \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( T \\):\n\\[ 80 - 42 - T = 18 \\]\n\\[ 38 - T = 18 \\]\n\\[ 38 - 18 = T \\]\n\\[ T = 20 \\]\n\nSo, Angie paid \\(\\boxed{20}\\) dollars in taxes this month."
