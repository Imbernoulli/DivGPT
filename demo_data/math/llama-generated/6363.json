        "To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the number of pages Sally reads each week and then multiply by the number of weeks it takes her to finish the book.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pages Sally reads in one week. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.\n\n- On weekdays, Sally reads 10 pages per day. Therefore, the total number of pages she reads in a week from weekdays is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\text{ days} \\times 10 \\text{ pages/day} = 50 \\text{ pages}\n  \\]\n\n- On weekends, Sally reads 20 pages per day. Therefore, the total number of pages she reads in a week from weekends is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ days} \\times 20 \\text{ pages/day} = 40 \\text{ pages}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we add the pages read from weekdays and weekends to find the total number of pages Sally reads in one week:\n\\[\n50 \\text{ pages} + 40 \\text{ pages} = 90 \\text{ pages}\n\\]\n\nSince it takes Sally 2 weeks to finish the book, we multiply the total number of pages she reads in one week by 2:\n\\[\n90 \\text{ pages/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 180 \\text{ pages}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of pages in the book is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{180}\n\\]",
