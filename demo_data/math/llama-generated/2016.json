        "To determine the number of white lights Malcolm initially had, we need to calculate the total number of colored lights he has bought and then find out how many he needs to buy in total. The difference between the total number of colored lights he needs to buy and the number he has already bought will give us the number of white lights he had initially.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of blue lights Malcolm bought:\n\\[ \\text{Number of blue lights} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of red lights} = 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of red, blue, and green lights he has bought:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of colored lights bought} = \\text{Number of red lights} + \\text{Number of blue lights} + \\text{Number of green lights} = 12 + 36 + 6 = 54 \\]\n\nMalcolm still has 5 colored lights left to buy, so the total number of colored lights he needs to buy is:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of colored lights needed} = \\text{Total number of colored lights bought} + \\text{Number of colored lights left to buy} = 54 + 5 = 59 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of white lights Malcolm had initially is:\n\\[ \\boxed{59} \\]",

Therefore, the total number of colored lights he will have after buying the remaining 5 lights is:\n\n\\[ 54 + 5 = 59 \\]\n\nSince the total number of colored lights Malcolm will have is equal to the number of white lights he had initially, the number of white lights Malcolm had initially is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{59} \\]",
