        "To determine how much money James spent, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the items before tax.**\n   - The cost of the milk is $3.\n   - The cost of the bananas is $2.\n   - Adding these together gives:\n     \\[\n     3 + 2 = 5\n     \\]\n   So, the total cost of the items before tax is $5.\n\n2. **Calculate the sales tax.**\n   - The sales tax rate is 20%.\n   - To find 20% of the total cost, we multiply the total cost by 0.20:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 0.20 = 1\n     \\]\n   So, the sales tax is $1.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount spent.**\n   - Add the sales tax to the total cost of the items:\n     \\[\n     5 + 1 = 6\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money James spent is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
