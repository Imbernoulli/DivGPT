        "To determine how many pizzas Nunzio eats in 72 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pieces of pizza Nunzio eats in one day.\n2. Calculate the total number of pieces of pizza Nunzio eats in 72 days.\n3. Convert the total number of pieces into whole pizzas.\n\nFirst, we know that Nunzio eats 3 pieces of pizza each day. Therefore, in 72 days, the total number of pieces he eats is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ pieces/day} \\times 72 \\text{ days} = 216 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the total number of pieces into whole pizzas.
