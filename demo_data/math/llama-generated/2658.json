        "To determine the amount of money owned by James, we start by defining variables for the amounts owned by James and Ali. Let's denote the amount owned by Ali as \\( A \\). Since James owns $40 more than Ali, the amount owned by James can be expressed as \\( A + 40 \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the total amount of money owned by James and Ali together is $250. This relationship can be written as the following equation:\n\\[\nA + (A + 40) = 250\n\\]\n\nNext, we simplify the left side of the equation by combining like terms:\n\\[\n2A + 40 = 250\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( A \\), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n2A = 210\n\\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nA = 105\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Ali owns $105, we can find out how much James owns by adding $40 to Ali's amount:\n\\[\nA + 40 = 105 + 40 = 145\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount owned by James is \\(\\boxed{145}\\).",

        "To determine the amount of money owned by James, we start by defining the variables for the amounts owned by James and Ali. Let \\( A \\) represent the amount of money owned by Ali. Since James owns $40 more than Ali, we can express the amount owned by James as \\( A + 40 \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the total amount of money owned by both James and Ali is $250. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\\[\nA + (A + 40) = 250\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine the terms on the left-hand side of the equation:\n\\[\n2A + 40 = 250\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( A \\), we first subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n2A = 210\n\\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nA = 105\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Ali owns $105, we can find the amount owned by James by adding $40 to Ali's amount:\n\\[\nA + 40 = 105 + 40 = 145\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount owned by James is \\(\\boxed{145}\\).",
        "Let's define the amount of money owned by Ali as \\( A \\). According to the problem, James owns $40 more than Ali, so the amount of money owned by James is \\( A + 40 \\).\n\n Together, James and Ali own $250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ A + (A + 40) = 250 \\]\n\n Simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 2A + 40 = 250 \\]\n\n Next, isolate the term with \\( A \\) by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2A = 210 \\]\n\n Now, solve for \\( A \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ A = 105 \\]\n\n So, Ali owns $105. Since James owns $40 more than Ali, we can find the amount owned by James by adding $40 to $105:\n\\[ A + 40 = 105 + 40 = 145 \\]\n\n Therefore, the amount owned by James is \\(\\boxed{145}\\).",
