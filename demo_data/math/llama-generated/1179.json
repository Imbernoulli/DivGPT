Calculate how many sections she keeps on hand.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Jan starts with 1000 feet of cable and splits it into 25-foot sections. The number of sections is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1000}{25} = 40\n   \\]\n\n2. Jan gives \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the sections to her friend.

After giving 10 sections to her friend, the number of sections remaining is:\n   \\[\n   40 - 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. Jan puts half of the remaining sections in storage. The number of sections she puts in storage is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 = 15\n   \\]\n\n5. The number of sections she keeps on hand is:\n   \\[\n   30 - 15 = 15\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of cable Jan keeps on hand is \\(\\boxed{15}\\) sections. Since each section is 25 feet, the total length of cable she keeps on hand is:\n   \\[\n   15 \\times 25 = 375 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for the number of sections she keeps on hand, which is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",

Calculate how many sections she keeps on hand.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of 25-foot sections:**\n   Jan starts with 1000 feet of cable and splits it into 25-foot sections.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of sections} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ feet}}{25 \\text{ feet/section}} = 40 \\text{ sections}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many sections she gives to her friend:**\n   Jan gives \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the sections to her friend.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sections given to friend} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10 \\text{ sections}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how many sections she has left after giving some to her friend:**\n   After giving 10 sections to her friend, Jan has:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ sections left} = 40 - 10 = 30 \\text{ sections}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many sections she puts in storage:**\n   Jan puts half of the remaining sections in storage.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sections put in storage} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 = 15 \\text{ sections}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate how many sections she keeps on hand:**\n   After putting 15 sections in storage, Jan has:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sections kept on hand} = 30 - 15 = 15 \\text{ sections}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of cable Jan keeps on hand is \\(\\boxed{15}\\) sections.",

        "To determine how much cable Jan keeps on hand, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of 25-foot sections Jan gets from 1000 feet of cable.\n2. Determine how many sections she gives to a friend.\n3. Calculate how many sections she has left after giving some to a friend.\n4. Determine how many sections she puts in storage.\n5. Calculate how many sections she keeps on hand.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Jan buys 1000 feet of cable and splits it into 25-foot sections. The number of sections is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{1000}{25} = 40\n\\]\nSo, Jan has 40 sections of cable.\n\nNext, she gives 1/4 of the sections to a friend. The number of sections she gives to a friend is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\n\\]\nSo, she gives 10 sections to a friend. The number of sections she has left after giving some to a friend is:\n\\[\n40 - 10 = 30\n\\]\nThen, she puts half of the remaining sections in storage. The number of sections she puts in storage is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 = 15\n\\]\nSo, she puts 15 sections in storage.

Calculate how many sections she keeps on hand.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of 25-foot sections Jan can make:**\n   Jan starts with 1000 feet of cable. Since each section is 25 feet, the total number of sections is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1000}{25} = 40\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many sections she gives to a friend:**\n   Jan gives \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the sections to a friend. So, the number of sections she gives to a friend is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how many sections she has left after giving some to a friend:**\n   After giving 10 sections to a friend, Jan has:\n   \\[\n   40 - 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many sections she puts in storage:**\n   Jan puts half of the remaining sections in storage. So, the number of sections she puts in storage is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 = 15\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate how many sections she keeps on hand:**\n   After putting 15 sections in storage, Jan keeps:\n   \\[\n   30 - 15 = 15\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of sections Jan keeps on hand is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",

Calculate how many sections she keeps on hand.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of 25-foot sections Jan can make from the 1000 feet of cable:\n\\[\n\\frac{1000}{25} = 40\n\\]\nSo, Jan has 40 sections of cable.\n\nNext, we determine how many sections she gives to a friend. She gives \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the sections to a friend:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\n\\]\nSo, she gives 10 sections to a friend. This leaves her with:\n\\[\n40 - 10 = 30\n\\]\nsections of cable.\n\nThen, she puts half of the remaining sections in storage. So, she puts:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 = 15\n\\]\nsections in storage.

Calculate how many sections she keeps on hand.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of 25-foot sections Jan has.**\n\nJan starts with 1000 feet of cable. Since each section is 25 feet, we divide 1000 by 25:\n\\[\n\\frac{1000}{25} = 40\n\\]\nSo, Jan has 40 sections of cable.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many sections she gives to her friend.**\n\nJan gives \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the sections to her friend. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\n\\]\nSo, Jan gives 10 sections to her friend.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many sections remain after giving some to her friend.**\n\nAfter giving 10 sections to her friend, the number of sections remaining is:\n\\[\n40 - 10 = 30\n\\]\nSo, Jan has 30 sections left.\n\n**Step 4: Determine how many sections she puts in storage.**\n\nJan puts half of the remaining sections in storage. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 = 15\n\\]\nSo, Jan puts 15 sections in storage.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate how many sections she keeps on hand.**\n\nAfter putting 15 sections in storage, the number of sections she keeps on hand is:\n\\[\n30 - 15 = 15\n\\]\nSo, Jan keeps \\(\\boxed{15}\\) sections on hand.",
