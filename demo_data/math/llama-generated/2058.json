        "To determine how long it will be before Dara reaches the minimum age required by the company to be employed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Dara's current age.\n2. Calculate how many years it will take for Dara to reach the age of 25.\n\nFirst, let's find Dara's current age. According to the problem, in six years, Dara will be half the age of Jane. Jane is currently 28 years old, so in six years, Jane will be:\n\\[ 28 + 6 = 34 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nSince Dara will be half the age of Jane in six years, Dara's age in six years will be:\n\\[ \\frac{34}{2} = 17 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nTo find Dara's current age, we subtract six years from her age in six years:\n\\[ 17 - 6 = 11 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many years it will take for Dara to reach the minimum age required by the company, which is 25 years old. We do this by subtracting Dara's current age from 25:\n\\[ 25 - 11 = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will be \\(\\boxed{14}\\) years before Dara reaches the minimum age required by the company to be employed.",

        "To determine how long it will be before Dara reaches the minimum age required by the company to be employed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Dara's current age.\n2. Calculate how many years it will take for Dara to reach the minimum age of 25.\n\nFirst, let's find Dara's current age. We know that in six years, Dara will be half the age of Jane. Jane is currently 28 years old, so in six years, Jane will be:\n\\[ 28 + 6 = 34 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, in six years, Dara will be half of Jane's age at that time. Therefore, in six years, Dara will be:\n\\[ \\frac{34}{2} = 17 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nIf Dara will be 17 years old in six years, her current age is:\n\\[ 17 - 6 = 11 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many years it will take for Dara to reach the minimum age of 25. Since Dara is currently 11 years old, we calculate the difference between 25 and 11:\n\\[ 25 - 11 = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will be \\(\\boxed{14}\\) years before Dara reaches the minimum age required by the company to be employed.",
        "To determine how long it will be before Dara reaches the minimum age required by the company to be employed, we start by defining the current age of Dara. Let's denote Dara's current age as \\( D \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, in six years, Dara will be half the age of Jane. Jane's current age is 28 years, so in six years, Jane will be \\( 28 + 6 = 34 \\) years old. Therefore, in six years, Dara will be \\( D + 6 \\) years old. The problem states that at that time, Dara's age will be half of Jane's age, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ D + 6 = \\frac{34}{2} \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ D + 6 = 17 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( D \\) by subtracting 6 from both sides:\n\\[ D = 17 - 6 \\]\n\\[ D = 11 \\]\n\nSo, Dara is currently 11 years old. The minimum age required to be employed at the company is 25 years. To find out how long it will be before Dara reaches this age, we subtract Dara's current age from the minimum age required:\n\\[ 25 - 11 = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will be \\(\\boxed{14}\\) years before Dara reaches the minimum age required by the company to be employed.",
