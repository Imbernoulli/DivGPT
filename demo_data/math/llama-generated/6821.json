        "Let's define the cost of a Reuben sandwich as \\( R \\) dollars.

We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:\n\n\\[ 10R + 5(R + 2) = 55 \\]\n\nFirst, we distribute the 5 through the parentheses:\n\n\\[ 10R + 5R + 10 = 55 \\]\n\nNext, we combine the like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 15R + 10 = 55 \\]\n\nThen, we isolate the term with \\( R \\) by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 15R = 45 \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( R \\) by dividing both sides by 15:\n\n\\[ R = 3 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of a Reuben sandwich is $3.
