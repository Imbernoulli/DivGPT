He is traveling from Washington to Nevada but he needs to stop in Idaho which is 640 miles away from Washington and 550 miles away from Nevada to pick up some friends.  If Coby is traveling at a speed of 80 miles per hour going to Idaho and at a speed of 50 miles per hour from Idaho to Nevada, how many hours did it take for him to arrive at the destination?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total time Coby took to travel from Washington to Nevada, we need to break the trip into two segments: from Washington to Idaho and from Idaho to Nevada.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes to travel from Washington to Idaho:\n- Distance from Washington to Idaho: 640 miles\n- Speed: 80 miles per hour\n\nUsing the formula for time, \\( \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Time from Washington to Idaho} = \\frac{640 \\text{ miles}}{80 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes to travel from Idaho to Nevada:\n- Distance from Idaho to Nevada: 550 miles\n- Speed: 50 miles per hour\n\nAgain, using the formula for time:\n\\[\n\\text{Time from Idaho to Nevada} = \\frac{550 \\text{ miles}}{50 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 11 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the time for both segments to find the total travel time:\n\\[\n\\text{Total travel time} = 8 \\text{ hours} + 11 \\text{ hours} = 19 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time it took Coby to arrive at the destination is \\(\\boxed{19}\\) hours.",
