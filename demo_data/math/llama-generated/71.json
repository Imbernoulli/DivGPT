        "To determine the number of spotted and fluffy cats in the village, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of spotted cats.\n2. Determine the number of spotted and fluffy cats.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of spotted cats.**\n\nWe know that a third of all the cats in the village have spots. Since there are 120 cats in the village, we can find the number of spotted cats by multiplying 120 by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n120 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 40\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 40 spotted cats.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of spotted and fluffy cats.**\n\nWe know that a quarter of the spotted cats are fluffy. Therefore, we can find the number of spotted and fluffy cats by multiplying 40 by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\n40 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 10 spotted and fluffy cats.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "To determine the number of cats that are both spotted and fluffy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of spotted cats.\n2. Determine the number of spotted cats that are also fluffy.\n\nFirst, we know that a third of all the cats in the village have spots. Given that there are 120 cats in the village, we can calculate the number of spotted cats as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of spotted cats} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 120 = 40\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that a quarter of the spotted cats are fluffy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of spotted and fluffy cats as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of spotted and fluffy cats} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of cats that are spotted and fluffy is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
