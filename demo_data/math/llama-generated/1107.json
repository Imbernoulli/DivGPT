        "To determine how much time Tim spends biking in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he bikes and then divide that by his biking speed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Tim bikes to and from work each workday:\n- The distance to work is 20 miles.\n- The distance back home is also 20 miles.\n- Therefore, the total distance for one workday is \\(20 + 20 = 40\\) miles.\n\nNext, we calculate the total distance for all 5 workdays:\n- Since he bikes to and from work each day, the total distance for 5 workdays is \\(40 \\times 5 = 200\\) miles.\n\nNow, let's add the distance of his weekend bike ride:\n- The weekend bike ride is 200 miles.\n\nSo, the total distance Tim bikes in a week is:\n- \\(200\\) miles (work) + \\(200\\) miles (weekend) = \\(400\\) miles.\n\nNext, we need to determine the time he spends biking. We know his biking speed is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, the time spent biking is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{400 \\text{ miles}}{25 \\text{ mph}} = 16 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time Tim spends biking in a week is \\(\\boxed{16}\\) hours.",
        "To determine the total time Tim spends biking in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each part step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the distance Tim bikes to and from work each day:**\n   - The work is 20 miles away.\n   - Therefore, the round trip distance is \\( 20 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 40 \\text{ miles} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total distance Tim bikes to and from work in a week:**\n   - Tim works 5 days.\n   - Therefore, the total distance for work in a week is \\( 40 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 200 \\text{ miles} \\).\n\n3. **Add the distance of the weekend bike ride:**\n   - The weekend bike ride is 200 miles.\n   - Therefore, the total distance biked in a week is \\( 200 \\text{ miles} \\text{ (work)} + 200 \\text{ miles} \\text{ (weekend)} = 400 \\text{ miles} \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the time spent biking each week:**\n   - Tim bikes at a speed of 25 miles per hour.\n   - Therefore, the total time spent biking is \\( \\frac{400 \\text{ miles}}{25 \\text{ mph}} = 16 \\text{ hours} \\).\n\nThus, the total time Tim spends biking in a week is \\(\\boxed{16}\\) hours.",

Therefore, the total distance for one workday is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ miles} + 20 \\text{ miles} = 40 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total distance for all 5 workdays.
