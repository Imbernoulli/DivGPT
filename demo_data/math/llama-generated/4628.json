        "To determine the total amount of money Julia has already spent on food for her animals, we need to calculate the cost of food for both the rabbit and the parrot separately and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of food for the rabbit.

Therefore, the total cost for the rabbit food is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ weeks} \\times 12 \\text{ dollars/week} = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of food for the parrot.

        "To determine how much money Julia already spent on food for her animals, we need to calculate the cost of the rabbit food and the cost of the parrot food separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of the rabbit food. Julia has the rabbit for 5 weeks, and the weekly cost of the rabbit food is $12. Therefore, the total cost of the rabbit food is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ weeks} \\times 12 \\text{ dollars/week} = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the parrot food. Julia has the parrot for 3 weeks, and we know that the total weekly cost for both the rabbit and the parrot is $30. Since the weekly cost of the rabbit food is $12, the weekly cost of the parrot food is:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ dollars/week} - 12 \\text{ dollars/week} = 18 \\text{ dollars/week}\n\\]\nTherefore, the total cost of the parrot food is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ weeks} \\times 18 \\text{ dollars/week} = 54 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the total cost of the rabbit food and the total cost of the parrot food to find the total amount of money Julia already spent on food for her animals:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ dollars} + 54 \\text{ dollars} = 114 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Julia already spent on food for her animals is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{114}\n\\]",

Therefore, the weekly cost of the parrot food is:\n\\[\n30 - 12 = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the rabbit food over the 5 weeks.
