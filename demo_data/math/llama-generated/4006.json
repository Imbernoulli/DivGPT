Calculate the total cost of the cable, given that the cable costs $2000 per mile.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The total length of all the east-west streets is:\n   \\[\n   18 \\text{ streets} \\times 2 \\text{ miles/street} = 36 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. The total length of all the north-south streets is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ streets} \\times 4 \\text{ miles/street} = 40 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. The total length of street to be electrified is:\n   \\[\n   36 \\text{ miles} + 40 \\text{ miles} = 76 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n4. The total length of cable needed is:\n   \\[\n   76 \\text{ miles} \\times 5 \\text{ miles of cable/mile of street} = 380 \\text{ miles of cable}\n   \\]\n\n5. The total cost of the cable is:\n   \\[\n   380 \\text{ miles} \\times 2000 \\text{ dollars/mile} = 760000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of cable for the neighborhood is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{760000}\n\\]",
