        "To determine John's final weight, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the weight John loses after exercising.\n2. Subtract the weight lost from his initial weight.\n3. Add the weight he gains back to the weight after the loss.\n\nLet's start with the initial weight:\n\\[ \\text{Initial weight} = 220 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the weight John loses. He loses 10% of his body weight:\n\\[ \\text{Weight lost} = 10\\% \\text{ of } 220 = 0.10 \\times 220 = 22 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the weight lost from the initial weight:\n\\[ \\text{Weight after losing} = 220 - 22 = 198 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThen, we add the weight he gains back:\n\\[ \\text{Final weight} = 198 + 2 = 200 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, John's final weight is:\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]",
