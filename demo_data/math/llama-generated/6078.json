Subtract the number of damaged cups and the number of unused cups from the total number of cups prepared.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of paper cups prepared:\n- Liezl prepared four sets of 2-dozen paper cups.\n- One dozen equals 12 cups, so 2-dozen equals \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) cups.\n- Therefore, four sets of 2-dozen cups equal \\(4 \\times 24 = 96\\) cups.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of damaged cups and the number of unused cups from the total number of cups prepared:\n- There were 5 damaged cups.\n- There were 30 unused cups.\n- So, the total number of cups that were not used is \\(5 + 30 = 35\\) cups.\n- Therefore, the number of cups that were used is \\(96 - 35 = 61\\) cups.\n\nThe number of paper cups used is \\(\\boxed{61}\\).",

        "To determine how many paper cups were used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of paper cups Liezl prepared.\n2. Subtract the number of damaged cups and the number of unused cups from the total number of cups prepared.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of paper cups prepared. Liezl prepared four sets of 2-dozen paper cups. Since one dozen equals 12, two dozen equals \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) cups. Therefore, four sets of 2-dozen cups is:\n\\[4 \\times 24 = 96\\]\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of damaged cups and the number of unused cups from the total number of cups prepared. There were 5 damaged cups and 30 unused cups, so the total number of cups that were not used is:\n\\[5 + 30 = 35\\]\n\nSubtracting the number of cups that were not used from the total number of cups prepared gives us the number of cups that were used:\n\\[96 - 35 = 61\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of paper cups that were used is \\(\\boxed{61}\\).",
