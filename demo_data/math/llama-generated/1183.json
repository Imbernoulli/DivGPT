Therefore, the total cost for the baseballs is:\n\\[\n14 \\times 2.50 = 35\n\\]\nCoach B also bought a baseball bat for $18. Therefore, the total cost for the baseballs and the baseball bat is:\n\\[\n35 + 18 = 53\n\\]\nSo, Coach B spent $53.\n\n**Step 3: Determine how much more Coach A spent than Coach B.**\n\nTo find out how much more Coach A spent than Coach B, we subtract the total amount Coach B spent from the total amount Coach A spent:\n\\[\n290 - 53 = 237\n\\]\n\nThus, Coach A spent \\(\\boxed{237}\\) dollars more than Coach B.",
