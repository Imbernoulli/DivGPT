Each dog is walked separately. On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many poodles Charlotte can walk on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total time she spends dog-walking on Monday and Wednesday.\n\n**Monday:**\n- She walks 4 poodles. Each poodle takes 2 hours, so the time spent walking poodles on Monday is:\n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ poodles} \\times 2 \\text{ hours/poodle} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n- She walks 2 Chihuahuas. Each Chihuahua takes 1 hour, so the time spent walking Chihuahuas on Monday is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ Chihuahuas} \\times 1 \\text{ hour/Chihuahua} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n- The total time spent walking dogs on Monday is:\n  \\[\n  8 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 10 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n\n**Wednesday:**\n- She walks 4 Labradors. Each Labrador takes 3 hours, so the time spent walking Labradors on Wednesday is:\n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ Labradors} \\times 3 \\text{ hours/Labrador} = 12 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n\n**Total time spent on Monday and Wednesday:**\n- Adding the time spent on Monday and Wednesday gives:\n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ hours} + 12 \\text{ hours} = 22 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n\n**Tuesday:**\n- She walks 2 Chihuahuas, which takes:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ Chihuahuas} \\times 1 \\text{ hour/Chihuahua} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of poodles she walks on Tuesday. The time spent walking poodles on Tuesday is:\n  \\[\n  x \\text{ poodles} \\times 2 \\text{ hours/poodle} = 2x \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n- The total time spent walking dogs on Tuesday is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ hours} + 2x \\text{ hours} = 2 + 2x \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n\n**Total time spent on all three days:**\n- The total time spent walking dogs for the entire week is the sum of the time spent on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:\n  \\[\n  22 \\text{ hours} + (2 + 2x) \\text{ hours} = 24 + 2x \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n- We know that she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, so we set up the equation:\n  \\[\n  24 + 2x = 32\n  \\]\n- Solving for \\( x \\):\n  \\[\n  2x = 32 - 24\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  2x = 8\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x = 4\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, Charlotte can walk \\(\\boxed{4}\\) poodles on Tuesday.",

So, the time spent on poodles on Monday is \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) hours.\n- She walks 2 Chihuahuas, and each Chihuahua takes 1 hour. So, the time spent on Chihuahuas on Monday is \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) hours.\n- Therefore, the total time spent on Monday is \\(8 + 2 = 10\\) hours.\n\nNext, let's denote the number of poodles Charlotte walks on Tuesday as \\(x\\).

Then, the time spent walking poodles on Tuesday is \\(x \\times 2 = 2x\\) hours.\n- Therefore, the total time spent walking dogs on Tuesday is \\(2 + 2x\\) hours.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time spent walking dogs on Wednesday:\n- She walks 4 Labradors, and each Labrador takes 3 hours. So, the time spent walking Labradors on Wednesday is \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) hours.\n\nThe total time spent walking dogs for the entire week is the sum of the time spent on each day:\n\\[10 + (2 + 2x) + 12 = 24 + 2x\\]\n\nWe know that the total time spent walking dogs this week is 32 hours, so we can set up the following equation:\n\\[24 + 2x = 32\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we first subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[2x = 8\\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[x = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, Charlotte can walk \\(\\boxed{4}\\) poodles on Tuesday.",

So, the time spent walking poodles on Tuesday is \\(x \\times 2 = 2x\\) hours.\n- Therefore, the total time spent walking dogs on Tuesday is \\(2 + 2x\\) hours.\n\nOn Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors:\n- Each Labrador takes 3 hours, so the time spent walking Labradors on Wednesday is \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) hours.\n\nThe total time spent walking dogs for the entire week is the sum of the time spent each day:\n\\[10 + (2 + 2x) + 12 = 24 + 2x\\]\n\nWe know that the total time spent walking dogs this week is 32 hours, so we can set up the equation:\n\\[24 + 2x = 32\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[2x = 8\\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[x = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, Charlotte can walk \\(\\boxed{4}\\) poodles on Tuesday.",
        "To determine how many poodles Charlotte can walk on Tuesday, we need to calculate the total time she spends walking dogs on each day and then use the total time constraint for the week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time spent walking dogs on Monday:\n- She walks 4 poodles, and each poodle takes 2 hours. So, the time spent on poodles on Monday is \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) hours.\n- She walks 2 Chihuahuas, and each Chihuahua takes 1 hour. So, the time spent on Chihuahuas on Monday is \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) hours.\n- Therefore, the total time spent on Monday is \\(8 + 2 = 10\\) hours.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time spent walking dogs on Tuesday:\n- She walks 2 Chihuahuas, and each Chihuahua takes 1 hour. So, the time spent on Chihuahuas on Tuesday is \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) hours.\n- Let \\(x\\) be the number of poodles she walks on Tuesday. Each poodle takes 2 hours. So, the time spent on poodles on Tuesday is \\(2x\\) hours.\n- Therefore, the total time spent on Tuesday is \\(2 + 2x\\) hours.\n\nOn Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors:\n- Each Labrador takes 3 hours. So, the time spent on Labradors on Wednesday is \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) hours.\n\nThe total time spent walking dogs for the week is the sum of the time spent on each day:\n\\[10 + (2 + 2x) + 12 = 24 + 2x\\]\n\nWe know that the total time spent in dog-walking this week is 32 hours. So, we set up the following equation:\n\\[24 + 2x = 32\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we solve the equation:\n\\[2x = 32 - 24\\]\n\\[2x = 8\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{8}{2}\\]\n\\[x = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, Charlotte can walk \\(\\boxed{4}\\) poodles on Tuesday.",
        "To determine how many poodles Charlotte can walk on Tuesday, we need to calculate the total time she spends walking dogs each day and then use the total time available for the week to find out how many poodles she can walk on Tuesday.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time spent walking dogs on Monday:\n- She walks 4 poodles, and each poodle takes 2 hours, so the time spent on poodles is \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) hours.\n- She walks 2 Chihuahuas, and each Chihuahua takes 1 hour, so the time spent on Chihuahuas is \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) hours.\n- Therefore, the total time spent on Monday is \\(8 + 2 = 10\\) hours.\n\nNext, let's denote the number of poodles Charlotte walks on Tuesday as \\(x\\). She walks the same number of Chihuahuas as on Monday, which is 2 Chihuahuas. So, the time spent on Chihuahuas on Tuesday is \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) hours. The time spent on poodles on Tuesday is \\(x \\times 2 = 2x\\) hours. Therefore, the total time spent on Tuesday is \\(2x + 2\\) hours.\n\nOn Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. Since each Labrador takes 3 hours, the time spent on Labradors is \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) hours.\n\nThe total time spent walking dogs for the week is the sum of the time spent on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. We know this total time is 32 hours, so we can set up the following equation:\n\\[10 + (2x + 2) + 12 = 32\\]\n\nNow, let's simplify and solve the equation:\n\\[10 + 2x + 2 + 12 = 32\\]\n\\[24 + 2x = 32\\]\n\\[2x = 32 - 24\\]\n\\[2x = 8\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{8}{2}\\]\n\\[x = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, Charlotte can walk \\(\\boxed{4}\\) poodles on Tuesday.",
        "To determine how many poodles Charlotte can walk on Tuesday, we start by calculating the total time she spends walking dogs on Monday and Wednesday. \n\nOn Monday, she walks 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas.
