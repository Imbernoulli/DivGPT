        "To determine how many more zits there are in Mr. Jones' class than in Ms. Swanson's class, we need to calculate the total number of zits in each class and then find the difference between these two totals.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of zits in Ms. Swanson's class. The average number of zits per kid in Ms. Swanson's class is 5, and there are 25 kids in the class. Therefore, the total number of zits in Ms. Swanson's class is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 25 = 125 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of zits in Mr. Jones' class. The average number of zits per kid in Mr. Jones' class is 6, and there are 32 kids in the class. Therefore, the total number of zits in Mr. Jones' class is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 32 = 192 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the total number of zits in Mr. Jones' class and the total number of zits in Ms. Swanson's class:\n\\[ 192 - 125 = 67 \\]\n\nSo, there are \\(\\boxed{67}\\) more zits in Mr. Jones' class than in Ms. Swanson's class.",
