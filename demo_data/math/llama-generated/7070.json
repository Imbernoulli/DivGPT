        "To determine how much money Amelia will have left after buying all her meals, we need to calculate the cost of each course and the dessert, and then subtract these costs from her total budget.\n\n1. **First Course Cost:**\n   The first course costs $15.\n\n2. **Second Course Cost:**\n   The second course costs $5 more than the first course. Therefore, we add $5 to the cost of the first course:\n   \\[\n   15 + 5 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the second course costs $20.\n\n3. **Dessert Cost:**\n   The cost of the dessert is 25% of the price of the second course. We calculate 25% of $20:\n   \\[\n   0.25 \\times 20 = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the dessert costs $5.\n\n4. **Total Cost of AllCadastro:**\n   We add the costs of the first course, second course, and dessert:\n   \\[\n   15 + 20 + 5 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of all the meals is $40.\n\n5. **Money Left:**\n   Amelia starts with $60.

Therefore, we add $5 to the first course cost:\n   \\[\n   15 + 5 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the second course costs $20.\n\n3. **Dessert Cost:**\n   The cost of the dessert is 25% of the price of the second course. To find 25% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.25:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 0.25 = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the dessert costs $5.\n\n4. **Total Cost:**\n   To find the total cost of all the meals, we add the costs of the first course, the second course, and the dessert:\n   \\[\n   15 + 20 + 5 = 40\n   \\]\n\n5. **Money Left:**\n   Finally, we subtract the total cost from Amelia's initial amount of $60:\n   \\[\n   60 - 40 = 20\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Amelia will have \\boxed{20} dollars left after buying all those meals.",
        "To determine how much money Amelia will have left after buying all her meals, we need to calculate the cost of each course and the dessert, and then subtract the total cost from her initial $60.\n\n1. **First Course Cost**: The first course costs $15.\n2. **Second Course Cost**: The second course costs $5 more than the first course. Therefore, the second course cost is $15 + $5 = $20.\n3. **Dessert Cost**: The cost of the dessert is 25% of the price of the second course.
