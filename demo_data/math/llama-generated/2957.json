        "To determine how many hours Jo will continue reading the book, we first need to find her reading pace. We know that an hour ago, she was at page 60, and now she is at page 90. Therefore, in one hour, she reads:\n\n\\[ 90 - 60 = 30 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pages she has left to read. The book has 210 pages in total, and she is currently at page 90. So, the number of pages left is:\n\n\\[ 210 - 90 = 120 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nSince Jo reads 30 pages per hour, the number of hours she will continue reading is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{120 \\text{ pages}}{30 \\text{ pages per hour}} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, Jo will be reading the book for \\(\\boxed{4}\\) hours.",
