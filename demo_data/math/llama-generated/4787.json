        "To determine Betty's height, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find Carter's height.\n2. Use Carter's height to find Betty's height.\n3. Convert Betty's height from inches to feet.\n\nFirst, we know that Carter is twice as tall as his dog. The dog's height is 24 inches. Therefore, Carter's height is:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ inches} \\times 2 = 48 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Betty is 12 inches shorter than Carter. So, we subtract 12 inches from Carter's height to find Betty's height:\n\\[ 48 \\text{ inches} - 12 \\text{ inches} = 36 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nFinally, we need to convert Betty's height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide 36 inches by 12:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ inches} \\div 12 = 3 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, Betty's height is \\(\\boxed{3}\\) feet.",
