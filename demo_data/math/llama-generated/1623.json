        "To determine how many collectors edition dolls Ivy has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find out how many dolls Ivy has:**\n   Dina has 60 dolls and she has twice as many dolls as Ivy. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of dolls Ivy has} = \\frac{\\text{Number of dolls Dina has}}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given value:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of dolls Ivy has} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many of Ivy's dolls are collectors editions:**\n   We know that \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of Ivy's dolls are collectors editions. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of collectors edition dolls Ivy has} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\text{Number of dolls Ivy has}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the value we found for the number of dolls Ivy has:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of collectors edition dolls Ivy has} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 30 = 20\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of collectors edition dolls Ivy has is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
