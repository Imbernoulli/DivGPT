Since he didn't get caught by his wife, he went back the next day and took another 3 cookies out of the jar.  But after eating just one of the cookies, he felt guilty about it and put the other two cookies back.  His son, Louie Junior saw that his Dad was eating cookies.  So, Louie Junior took seven cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom for later.  The next morning, Debra, Lou's wife looked into the cookie jar and reacted by accusing her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar.

        "Let's start by determining the initial number of cookies in the jar. We'll denote this number as \\( x \\).\n\n1. Lou Senior took 3 cookies out of the jar and ate them. So, the number of cookies left in the jar is \\( x - 3 \\).\n2. The next day, Lou Senior took another 3 cookies out of the jar. He ate 1 and put the other 2 back. So, the net change in the number of cookies in the jar is \\( 3 - 2 = 1 \\). Therefore, the number of cookies left in the jar is \\( (x - 3) - 1 = x - 4 \\).\n3. Louie Junior took 7 cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom. So, the number of cookies left in the jar is \\( x - 4 - 7 = x - 11 \\).\n4. The next morning, Debra looked into the cookie jar andels by başing her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the jar. This means that the number of cookies left in the jar is half of the original number of cookies, which is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   x - 11 = \\frac{x}{2}\n   \\]\n5. To solve for \\( x \\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:\n   \\[\n   2(x - 11) = x\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   2x - 22 = x\n   \\]\n   Next, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting \\( x \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x - 22 = 0\n   \\]\n   Adding 22 to both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   x = 22\n   \\]\n   So, the initial number of cookies in the jar was 22.\n6. To find out how many cookies remained in the jar, we substitute \\( x = 22 \\) back into the expression for the number of cookies left after Louie Junior took his cookies:\n   \\[\n   x - 11 = 22 - 11 = 11\n   \\]\nTherefore, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
        "To determine how many cookies remained in the jar, we need to follow the sequence of events and account for the cookies taken and returned.\n\n1. **InitialConditions**: Let's denote the initial number of cookies in the jar as \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Lou Senior's First Visit**: Lou Senior takes 3 cookies out and eats them.\n   \\[\n   x - 3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Lou Senior's Second Visit**: The next day, Lou Senior takes another 3 cookies out.\n   \\[\n   (x - 3) - 3 = x - 6\n   \\]\n   However, he puts 2 cookies back.\n   \\[\n   (x - 6) + 2 = x - 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Louie Junior's Visit**: Louie Junior takes 7 cookies out.\n   \\[\n   (x - 4) - 7 = x - 11\n   \\]\n\n5. **Debra's Observation**: Debra accuses Lou of eating half of the cookies. This implies that the number of cookies left in the jar is half of the initial number of cookies \\( x \\).\n   \\[\n   x - 11 = \\frac{x}{2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solving the Equation**: To find \\( x \\), we solve the equation:\n   \\[\n   x - 11 = \\frac{x}{2}\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[\n   2(x - 11) = x\n   \\]\n   Simplify and solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   2x - 22 = x\n   \\]\n   Subtract \\( x \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x - 22 = 0\n   \\]\n   Add 22 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   x = 22\n   \\]\n\n7. **Final Calculation**: Substitute \\( x = 22 \\) back into the expression for the number of cookies remaining:\n   \\[\n   x - 11 = 22 - 11 = 11\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",

Then we have:\n\n\\[ 11 = \\frac{x}{2} \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[ x = 11 \\times 2 = 22 \\]\n\nSo, the original number of cookies in the jar was 22. After 11 cookies have been taken out, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is:\n\n\\[ 22 - 11 = 11 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]",

So, the net number of cookies he took out is:\n\\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \\]\nTherefore, the number of cookies left in the jar after the second day is:\n\\[ (x - 3) - 1 = x - 4 \\]\n\nNext, Louie Junior took 7 cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom. So, the number of cookies left in the jar is:\n\\[ (x - 4) - 7 = x - 11 \\]\n\nThe next morning, Debra looks into the cookie jar andrut that her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar. This means the number of cookies left in the jar is half of the initial number of cookies:\n\\[ x - 11 = \\frac{x}{2} \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ x - 11 = \\frac{x}{2} \\]\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\\[ 2(x - 11) = x \\]\n\\[ 2x - 22 = x \\]\nSubtract \\( x \\) from both sides:\n\\[ x - 22 = 0 \\]\nAdd 22 to both sides:\n\\[ x = 22 \\]\n\nSo, the initial number of cookies in the jar is 22.

Let's denote the original number of cookies in the jar as \\( x \\). According to Debra, Lou Senior and Louie Junior together ate half of the cookies, so:\n\\[ 11 = \\frac{x}{2} \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ x = 11 \\times 2 = 22 \\]\n\nThe original number of cookies in the jar was 22.

After Lou Senior took 3 cookies, the number of cookies left is \\( x - 3 \\).\n\n2. **Second Day**: Lou Senior went back the next day and took another 3 cookies out of the jar. After eating just one of the cookies, he put the other two cookies back. So, the net change in the number of cookies is \\( -3 + 2 = -1 \\). Therefore, after the second day, the number of cookies left is \\( (x - 3) - 1 = x - 4 \\).\n\n3. **Louie Junior's Action**: Louie Junior took seven cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom.

To find out how many cookies remained in the jar, we substitute \\( x = 22 \\) back into the expression for the number of cookies left after Louie Junior's visit:\n\\[ x - 11 = 22 - 11 = 11 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]",
        "Let's start by determining how many cookies Lou Senior took out of the jar and how many he put back.\n\n1. On the first day, Lou Senior took 3 cookies out of the jar and ate them.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cookies taken out} = 3\n   \\]\n\n2. On the second day, Lou Senior took another 3 cookies out of the jar. After eating just one cookie, he put the other two cookies back.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cookies taken out on the second day} = 3 - 2 = 1\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of cookies Lou Senior took out of the jar is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cookies taken out by Lou Senior} = 3 + 1 = 4\n\\]\n\n3. Louie Junior took 7 cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cookies taken out by Louie Junior} = 7\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of cookies taken out of the jar by both Lou Senior and Louie Junior is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cookies taken out} = 4 + 7 = 11\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Debra accuses her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the jar. This means that the 11 cookies taken out represent half of the original number of cookies in the jar. Let \\( x \\) be the original number of cookies in the jar. Then:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} = 11\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[\nx = 11 \\times 2 = 22\n\\]\n\nThe original number of cookies in the jar was 22. After 11 cookies were taken out, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cookies remaining} = 22 - 11 = 11\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]",
        "Let's start by determining how many cookies Lou Senior took out of the jar in total.\n\n1. On the first day, Lou Senior took 3 cookies out of the jar.\n2. On the second day, Lou Senior took another 3 cookies out of the jar, but after eating just one, he put the other two back. So, he effectively took \\(3 - 2 = 1\\) cookie out of the jar.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of cookies Lou Senior took out of the jar is:\n\\[3 + 1 = 4\\]\n\nNext, Louie Junior took 7 cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom. So, the total number of cookies taken out of the jar by Lou Senior and Louie Junior is:\n\\[4 + 7 = 11\\]\n\nDebra accused her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the jar. Let's denote the initial number of cookies in the jar as \\(x\\). According to Debra, Lou Senior and Louie Junior together ate half of the cookies, so:\n\\[\\frac{x}{2} = 11\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\\[x = 11 \\times 2 = 22\\]\n\nTherefore, the initial number of cookies in the jar was 22. After Lou Senior and Louie Junior took their cookies out, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is:\n\\[22 - 11 = 11\\]\n\nSo, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is:\n\\[\\boxed{11}\\]",
        "To determine how many cookies remained in the jar, we need to follow the sequence of events and update the number of cookies accordingly.\n\n1. **初始 cookies**: Let's assume there were \\( x \\) cookies in the jar initially.\n\n2. **Lou Senior's first trip**:\n   - Lou Senior took 3 cookies.\n   - He ate all 3 cookies.\n   - Cookies left: \\( x - 3 \\).\n\n3. **Lou Senior's second trip**:\n   - Lou Senior took another 3 cookies.\n   - He ate 1 cookie.\n   - He put back 2 cookies.\n   - Cookies left: \\( (x - 3) - 3 + 2 = x - 4 \\).\n\n4. **Louie Junior's trip**:\n   - Louie Junior took 7 cookies.\n   - He hid them in his bedroom.\n   - Cookies left: \\( (x - 4) - 7 = x - 11 \\).\n\n5. **Debra's observation**:\n   - Debra accused Lou of eating half of the cookies.\n   - This implies that the number of cookies left in the jar is half of the initial number of cookies.\n   - Therefore, \\( x - 11 = \\frac{x}{2} \\).\n\n6. **Solving for \\( x \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x - 11 = \\frac{x}{2}\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[\n   2(x - 11) = x\n   \\]\n   Simplify and solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   2x - 22 = x\n   \\]\n   Subtract \\( x \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x = 22\n   \\]\n\n7. **Final number of cookies**:\n   - Initially, there were 22 cookies.\n   - After Lou Senior and Louie Junior's trips, the number of cookies left is:\n     \\[\n     22 - 11 = 11\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
        "Let's start by determining the initial number of cookies in the jar. We'll call this number \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, Lou Senior takes 3 cookies out of the jar and eats them. So, the number of cookies left in the jar is:\n\\[ x - 3 \\]\n\nNext, Lou Senior goes back the next day and takes another 3 cookies out of the jar. He eats 1 and puts the other 2 back. So, the net number of cookies taken out of the jar is:\n\\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \\]\nTherefore, the number of cookies left in the jar after this is:\n\\[ (x - 3) - 1 = x - 4 \\]\n\nThen, Louie Junior takes 7 cookies out of the jar and hides them in his bedroom. So, the number of cookies left in the jar is:\n\\[ (x - 4) - 7 = x - 11 \\]\n\nThe next morning, Debra looks into the cookie jar and react by wedging her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar. This means that the number of cookies left in the jar is half of the initial number of cookies:\n\\[ x - 11 = \\frac{x}{2} \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ x - 11 = \\frac{x}{2} \\]\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\\[ 2(x - 11) = x \\]\n\\[ 2x - 22 = x \\]\nSubtract \\( x \\) from both sides:\n\\[ x - 22 = 0 \\]\nAdd 22 to both sides:\n\\[ x = 22 \\]\n\nSo, the initial number of cookies in the jar was 22. To find out how many cookies remained in the jar, we substitute \\( x = 22 \\) back into the expression for the number of cookies left after Louie Junior took his cookies:\n\\[ x - 11 = 22 - 11 = 11 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]",
        "Let's start by determining how many cookies Lou Senior took out of the jar. On the first day, he took 3 cookies. On the second day, he took another 3 cookies but put back 2 after eating one. So, the net number of cookies Lou Senior took out of the jar is:\n\n\\[3 + (3 - 2) = 3 + 1 = 4\\]\n\nNext, Louie Junior took 7 cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom. Therefore, the total number of cookies taken out of the jar by Lou Senior and Louie Junior is:\n\n\\[4 + 7 = 11\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Debra accused her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the jar. This means that the number of cookies taken out of the jar is half of the original number of cookies in the jar. Let \\(x\\) be the original number of cookies in the jar.

Since 11 cookies were taken out, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is:\n\n\\[22 - 11 = 11\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
        "To determine how many cookies remained in the jar, let's break down the sequence of events and calculate the changes in the number of cookies step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Action by Lou Senior:**\n   - Lou Senior took 3 cookies out of the jar and ate them.\n   - This reduces the number of cookies in the jar by 3.\n\n2. **Second Action by Lou Senior:**\n   - The next day, Lou Senior took another 3 cookies out of the jar.\n   - He ate 1 cookie and put the other 2 cookies back.\n   - This results in a net reduction of \\(3 - 2 = 1\\) cookie.\n\n3. **Action by Louie Junior:**\n   - Louie Junior took 7 cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom.\n   - This reduces the number of cookies in the jar by 7.\n\n4. **下面小编's Gloria's Carol:**\n   - Debra accused Lou of eating

        "Let's start by determining the initial number of cookies in the jar. We will use \\( x \\) to represent this initial number.\n\nFirst, Lou Senior took 3 cookies out of the jar and ate them. So, the number of cookies left in the jar is:\n\\[ x - 3 \\]\n\nThe next day, Lou Senior took another 3 cookies out of the jar and ate 1, but put the other 2 back. So, he effectively took only 1 cookie out of the jar that day. Therefore, the number of cookies left in the jar is:\n\\[ (x - 3) - 1 = x - 4 \\]\n\nLouie Junior then took 7 cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom. So, the number of cookies left in the jar is:\n\\[ (x - 4) - 7 = x - 11 \\]\n\nThe next morning, Debra looked into the cookie jar and accused her husband of eating half of the cookies. This means that the number of cookies left in the jar is half of the initial number of cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ x - 11 = \\frac{x}{2} \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:\n\\[ 2(x - 11) = x \\]\n\\[ 2x - 22 = x \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting \\( x \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 2x - x - 22 = 0 \\]\n\\[ x - 22 = 0 \\]\n\\[ x = 22 \\]\n\nSo, the initial number of cookies in the jar was 22. Now, we substitute \\( x = 22 \\) back into the expression for the number of cookies left in the jar:\n\\[ x - 11 = 22 - 11 = 11 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]",
        "Let's start by determining the initial number of cookies in the jar and then follow the sequence of events step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of cookies**: Let's denote the initial number of cookies in the jar as \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Lou Senior's first trip**: Lou Senior took 3 cookies out of the jar and ate them. So, the number of cookies left in the jar is \\( x - 3 \\).\n\n3. **Lou Senior's second trip**: The next day, Lou Senior took another 3 cookies out of the jar. After eating 1 cookie, he put the other 2 cookies back. So, the net number of cookies taken out by Lou Senior on his second trip is \\( 3 - 2 = 1 \\). Therefore, the number of cookies left in the jar after his second trip is \\( (x - 3) - 1 = x - 4 \\).\n\n4. **Louie Junior's trip**: Louie Junior took 7 cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom. So, the number of cookies left in the jar is \\( (x - 4) - 7 = x - 11 \\).\n\n5. **Debra's observation**: The next morning, Debra look into the cookie jar and accused her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar. This means that the number of cookies left in the jar is half of the initial number of cookies, i.e., \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   x - 11 = \\frac{x}{2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solving the equation**: To solve for \\( x \\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:\n   \\[\n   2(x - 11) = x\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   2x - 22 = x\n   \\]\n   Next, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting \\( x \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2x - x - 22 = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further, we get:\n   \\[\n   x - 22 = 0\n   \\]\n   Adding 22 to both sides, we find:\n   \\[\n   x = 22\n   \\]\n\nSo, the initial number of cookies in the jar was 22. To find out how many cookies remained in the jar, we substitute \\( x = 22 \\) back into the expression for the number of cookies left after Louie Junior's trip:\n\\[\nx - 11 = 22 - 11 = 11\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies that remained in the jar is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
        "To determine how many cookies remained in the jar, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Action by Lou Senior:**\n   - Lou Senior took 3 cookies out of the jar and ate them.\n   - This reduces the number of cookies in the jar by 3.\n\n2. **Second Action by Lou Senior:**\n   - The next day, Lou Senior took another 3 cookies out of the jar.\n   - He ate 1 cookie and put the other 2 cookies back.\n   - This results in a net reduction of \\(3 - 2 = 1\\) cookie in the jar.\n\n3. **Action by Louie Junior:**\n   - Louie Junior took 7 cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom.\n   - This reduces the number of cookies in the jar by 7.\n\n4. **xDC by Debra:**\n   - Debra accused her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the jar.\n   - This implies that the number of cookies left in the jar is half of the initial number of cookies.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the initial number of cookies in the jar. According to Debra's accusation, after all the actions, the number of cookies left in the jar is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\).\n\nWe can set up the following equation to represent the total reduction in the number of cookies:\n\\[\nx - 3 - 1 - 7 = \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[\nx - 11 = \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:\n\\[\n2(x - 11) = x\n\\]\n\nDistribute the 2:\n\\[\n2x - 22 = x\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\nx - 22 = 0\n\\]\n\nAdd 22 to both sides:\n\\[\nx = 22\n\\]\n\nSo, the initial number of cookies in the jar was 22. To find out how many cookies remained in the jar, we substitute \\( x = 22 \\) back into the expression for the number of cookies left:\n\\[\n\\frac{22}{2} = 11\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
        "Let's start by determining the total number of cookies Lou Senior took out of the jar. Lou Senior took 3 cookies on the first day and 3 cookies on the second day, but he put back 2 cookies on the second day. So, the net number of cookies Lou Senior took out is:\n\n\\[3 + 3 - 2 = 4\\]\n\nNext, Louie Junior took 7 cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom. So, the total number of cookies taken out of the jar by Lou Senior and Louie Junior is:\n\n\\[4 + 7 = 11\\]\n\nDebra accused Lou of eating half of the cookies out of the jar. This means that the 11 cookies taken out represent half of the original number of cookies in the jar. Therefore, the original number of cookies in the jar is:\n\n\\[11 \\times 2 = 22\\]\n\nSince 11 cookies have been taken out, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is:\n\n\\[22 - 11 = 11\\]\n\nSo, the number of cookies remaining in the jar is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{11}\\]",
        "Let's start by determining how many cookies Lou Senior took out of the cookie jar and how many he put back. On the first day, Lou Senior took 3 cookies out and ate them. On the second day, he took another 3 cookies out but put 2 back after eating 1. Therefore, the net number of cookies Lou Senior took out over the two days is:\n\n\\[3 + (3 - 2) = 3 + 1 = 4\\]\n\nNext, Louie Junior took 7 cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom. So, the total number of cookies taken out of the jar by Lou Senior and Louie Junior is:\n\n\\[4 + 7 = 11\\]\n\nDebra accused her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar. This means that the number of cookies taken out of the jar is half of the original number of cookies in the jar. Let's denote the original number of cookies in the jar as \\(x\\).

But after eating just one of the cookies, he put the other two cookies back. So, the net number of cookies he took out is:\n\\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \\]\nTherefore, the number of cookies left in the jar now is:\n\\[ (x - 3) - 1 = x - 4 \\]\n\nThen, Louie Junior took 7 cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom. So, the number of cookies left in the jar is:\n\\[ (x - 4) - 7 = x - 11 \\]\n\nThe next morning, Debra look into the cookie jar and superior by contradictions her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar. This means that the number of cookies left in the jar is half of the initial number of cookies:\n\\[ x - 11 = \\frac{x}{2} \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we can solve the equation:\n\\[ x - 11 = \\frac{x}{2} \\]\nMultiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:\n\\[ 2(x - 11) = x \\]\n\\[ 2x - 22 = x \\]\nSubtract \\( x \\) from both sides:\n\\[ x - 22 = 0 \\]\nAdd 22 to both sides:\n\\[ x = 22 \\]\n\nSo, the initial number of cookies in the jar was 22. Now, we need to find out how many cookies remained in the jar after all the events. We already calculated that the number of cookies left in the jar after Lou Senior and Louie Junior took their cookies is:\n\\[ x - 11 = 22 - 11 = 11 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies that remained in the jar is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]",
