The TV costs $1700 and she has earned $1200, so:\n\\[ 1700 \\text{ dollars} - 1200 \\text{ dollars} = 500 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nSince she earns $10 per hour, the number of additional hours she has to work to earn $500 is:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ dollars} \\div 10 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 50 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, Latia has to work \\(\\boxed{50}\\) more hours to buy the TV.",
