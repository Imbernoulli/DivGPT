        "To determine how many rabbits the bear needs to catch each day, we need to calculate the total amount of meat required for the bear and her cubs in a week and then find out how many rabbits she needs to catch each day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of meat required for the bear and her cubs in a week:\n- The bear needs 210 pounds of meat.\n- Each cub needs 35 pounds of meat, and she has 4 cubs.\n- Therefore, the total amount of meat needed for the cubs is \\(35 \\times 4 = 140\\) pounds.\n\nAdding the meat needed for the bear and the cubs gives us the total weekly meat requirement:\n\\[210 + 140 = 350 \\text{ pounds}\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many rabbits the bear needs to catch each day. Since she hunts daily, we divide the total weekly meat requirement by 7 (the number of days in a week):\n\\[350 \\div 7 = 50 \\text{ pounds per day}\\]\n\nEach rabbit weighs 5 pounds, so the number of rabbits she needs to catch each day is:\n\\[50 \\div 5 = 10\\]\n\nTherefore, the bear needs to catch \\(\\boxed{10}\\) rabbits each day.",
