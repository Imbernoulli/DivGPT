        "To determine how much Sid spent on computer accessories, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total amount of money Sid originally had:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Original amount} = \\$48\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how much money Sid spent on snacks:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on snacks} = \\$8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Let \\( x \\) represent the amount of money Sid spent on computer accessories.**\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount of money Sid spent on both computer accessories and snacks:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total spent} = x + 8\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine how much money Sid has left after his purchases:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Money left} = 48 - (x + 8) = 48 - x - 8 = 40 - x\n   \\]\n\n6. **According to the problem, after these purchases, Sid has \\( \\ \\$4 \\) more than half of his original money left. Calculate half of his original money:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Half of original money} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24\n   \\]\n\n7. **Set up the equation to find out how much money Sid has left:**\n   \\[\n   40 - x = 24 + 4\n   \\]\n\n8. Simplify the right-hand side of the equation:**\n   \\[\n   40 - x = 28\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   40 - 28 = x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Sid spent \\(\\boxed{12}\\) dollars on computer accessories.",
        "Let's denote the amount of money Sid spent on computer accessories as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we know that Sid started with $48. He spent $x on computer accessories and $8 on snacks. So, the total amount of money he spent is \\( x + 8 \\).\n\nAfter these purchases, the amount of money Sid has left is \\( 48 - (x + 8) = 48 - x - 8 = 40 - x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, after these purchases, Sid has $4 more than half of his original money left. Half of his original money is \\( \\frac{48}{2} = 24 \\). Therefore, $4 more than half of his original money is \\( 24 + 4 = 28 \\).\n\nSo, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 40 - x = 28 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 28 from both sides:\n\\[ 40 - x - 28 = 28 - 28 \\]\n\\[ 12 - x = 0 \\]\n\\[ 12 = x \\]\n\nTherefore, Sid spent \\(\\boxed{12}\\) dollars on computer accessories."
