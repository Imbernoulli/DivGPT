        "To determine the total number of times Wilson sleds down the hills, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of times Wilson sleds down the tall hills. Since there are 2 tall hills and he sleds down each tall hill 4 times, the total number of times he sleds down the tall hills is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hills} \\times 4 \\text{ times/hill} = 8 \\text{ times} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of times Wilson sleds down the small hills. Since there are 3 small hills and he sleds down each small hill half as often as he sleds down each tall hill, he sleds down each small hill 4/2 = 2 times. Therefore, the total number of times he sleds down the small hills is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hills} \\times 2 \\text{ times/hill} = 6 \\text{ times} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of times he sleds down the tall hills and the number of times he sleds down the small hills to find the total number of times he sleds down all the hills:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ times} + 6 \\text{ times} = 14 \\text{ times} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of times Wilson sleds down the hills is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",

Since there are 3 small hills and he sleds down each one half as often as he sleds down each tall hill, we first find out how many times he sleds down each small hill:\n\\[ \\frac{4 \\text{ times}}{2} = 2 \\text{ times} \\]\nThen, we multiply the number of small hills by the number of times he sleds down each small hill:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hills} \\times 2 \\text{ times/hill} = 6 \\text{ times} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of times he sleds down the tall hills and the number of times he sleds down the small hills to get the total number of times he sleds down all the hills:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ times} + 6 \\text{ times} = 14 \\text{ times} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of times Wilson sleds down the hills is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
