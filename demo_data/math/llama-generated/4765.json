        "To determine how much more money James has after selling his toys compared to before he bought them, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of toys James sells:**\n   James decides to sell 80% of his toys. He started with 200 toys.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of toys sold} = 0.80 \\times 200 = 160\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the toys:**\n   James sells each toy for $30.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total revenue} = 160 \\times 30 = 4800\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the toys:**\n   James bought each toy for $20.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 200 \\times 20 = 4000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the net gain from selling the toys:**\n   Subtract the total cost from the total revenue.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net gain} = 4800 - 4000 = 800\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, James has \\(\\boxed{800}\\) dollars more money compared to before he bought the toys.",
        "To determine how much more money James has compared to before he bought the toys, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of toys James sells.\n2. Determine the total cost of the toys he bought.\n3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the toys.\n4. Find the difference between the revenue from selling the toys and the cost of the toys.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of toys James sells. He decides to sell 80% of his 200 toys:\n\\[\n0.80 \\times 200 = 160\n\\]\nSo, James sells 160 toys.\n\nNext, we determine the total cost of the toys he bought. Each toy cost $20, and he bought 200 toys:\n\\[\n200 \\times 20 = 4000\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the toys is $4000.\n\nNow, we calculate the total revenue from selling the toys. Each toy is sold for $30, and he sells 160 toys:\n\\[\n160 \\times 30 = 4800\n\\]\nSo, the total revenue from selling the toys is $4800.\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the revenue from selling the toys and the cost of the toys:\n\\[\n4800 - 4000 = 800\n\\]\nSo, James has $800 more money compared to before he bought the toys.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{800}\n\\]",
