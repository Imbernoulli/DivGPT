        "To determine how many more pages per day Ryan read compared to his brother, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pages Ryan read:**\n   Ryan got five books from the library, and the total number of pages in these books is 2100 pages.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of pages Ryan's brother read:**\n   Ryan's brother got one book each day for a week, and each book has 200 pages.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pages read by brother} = \\text{Number of books per day} \\times \\text{Number of days} = 1 \\times 7 = 7 \\text{ books}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pages read by brother} = \\text{Total number of books} \\times \\text{Pages per book} = 7 \\times 200 = 1400 \\text{ pages}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the average number of pages Ryan read per day:**\n   Ryan finishes his books in a week, which is 7 days.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average pages per day for Ryan} = \\frac{\\text{Total pages read by Ryan}}{\\text{Number of days}} = \\frac{2100}{7} = 300 \\text{ pages per day}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the average number of pages Ryan's brother read per day:**\n   Ryan's brother finishes his books in a week, which is 7 days.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average pages per day for brother} = \\frac{\\text{Total pages read by brother}}{\\text{Number of days}} = \\frac{1400}{7} = 200 \\text{ pages per day}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine how many more pages per day Ryan read compared to his brother:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference in pages per day} = \\text{Average pages per day for Ryan} - \\text{Average pages per day for brother} = 300 - 200 = 100 \\text{ pages per day}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Ryan read \\(\\boxed{100}\\) more pages per day compared to his brother.",

For Ryan, the average number of pages per day is:\n\\[ \\frac{2100 \\text{ pages}}{7 \\text{ days}} = 300 \\text{ pages/day} \\]\n\nFor Ryan's brother, the average number of pages per day is:\n\\[ \\frac{1400 \\text{ pages}}{7 \\text{ days}} = 200 \\text{ pages/day} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference in the average number of pages per day between Ryan and his brother:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ pages/day} - 200 \\text{ pages/day} = 100 \\text{ pages/day} \\]\n\nThus, on average, Ryan read \\(\\boxed{100}\\) more pages per day compared to his brother.",
