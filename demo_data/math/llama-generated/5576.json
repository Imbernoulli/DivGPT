To find out how many kilograms of strawberries he ordered, we subtract the total weight of the apples, oranges, and grapes from the total weight of the fruit:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ kg} - 7 \\text{ kg} = 3 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of kilograms of strawberries Tommy ordered is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
        "To determine how many kilograms of strawberries Tommy ordered, we start by noting the total weight of fruits he ordered and the weights of the apples, oranges, and grapes. The total weight of the fruits is 10 kilograms. Tommy ordered 3 kilograms of apples, 1 kilogram of orange, and 3 kilograms of grapes. We can find the total weight of the apples, oranges, and grapes by adding their individual weights together:\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ kg (apples)} + 1 \\text{ kg (oranges)} + 3 \\text{ kg (grapes)} = 7 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total weight of the apples, oranges, and grapes from the total weight of the fruits to find the weight of the strawberries:\n\n\\[\n10 \\text{ kg (total)} - 7 \\text{ kg (apples, oranges, and grapes)} = 3 \\text{ kg (strawberries)}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the weight of the strawberries Tommy ordered is \\boxed{3}.",
