Let \\( t \\) represent the number of rows of tomato plants. Then the number of rows of cucumber plants is \\( 2t \\).\n\n   The total number of rows is the sum of the rows of tomato plants and the rows of cucumber plants:\n   \\[\n   t + 2t = 15\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   3t = 15\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( t \\), we divide both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   t = 5\n   \\]\n   So, Aubrey has 5 rows of tomato plants.\n\n2. **Determine the number of rows of cucumber plants:**\n   Since \\( t = 5 \\), the number of rows of cucumber plants is:\n   \\[\n   2t = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, Aubrey has 10 rows of cucumber plants.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of tomato plants:**\n   There are 8 tomato plants in each row, and Aubrey has 5 rows of tomato plants.

        "To determine the total number of tomatoes Aubrey will have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Define variables for the number of rows of tomato plants and cucumber plants.\n2. Set up an equation based on the given relationship between the rows of tomato and cucumber plants.\n3. Solve for the number of rows of tomato plants.\n4. Calculate the total number of tomato plants.\n5. Determine the total number of tomatoes produced.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Let \\( t \\) be the number of rows of tomato plants. According to the problem, for each row of tomato plants, Aubrey is planting 2 rows of cucumber plants. Therefore, the number of rows of cucumber plants is \\( 2t \\).\n\nThe total number of rows of plants is the sum of the rows of tomato plants and the rows of cucumber plants. We know that Aubrey has enough room for 15 rows of plants in total. So, we can write the equation:\n\\[ t + 2t = 15 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 3t = 15 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( t \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ t = \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\]\n\nSo, Aubrey has 5 rows of tomato plants. Since each row of tomato plants contains 8 tomato plants, the total number of tomato plants is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\]\n\nEach tomato plant produces 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes produced is:\n\\[ 40 \\times 3 = 120 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of tomatoes Aubrey will have is:\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]",

According to the problem, for each row of tomato plants, Aubrey is planting 2 rows of cucumbers. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   c = 2t\n   \\]\n\n3. Aubrey has enough room for 15 rows of plants in total. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   t + c = 15\n   \\]\n\n4. Substitute the expression for \\( c \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   t + 2t = 15\n   \\]\n\n5. Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   3t = 15\n   \\]\n\n6.
