Therefore, the number of dresses Lisa has can be expressed as \\( x + 18 \\).\n\nThe problem also states that the total number of dresses they have together is 48. So, we can set up the following equation to represent this situation:\n\\[ x + (x + 18) = 48 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 2x + 18 = 48 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we need to get rid of the constant term 18. We do this by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2x = 48 - 18 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 30 \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ x = \\frac{30}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 15 \\]\n\nSo, Ana has \\(\\boxed{15}\\) dresses.",
