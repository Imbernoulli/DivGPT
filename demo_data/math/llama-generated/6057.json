        "To determine the total number of questions Phillip gets right on both the math test and the English test, we need to calculate the number of correct answers for each test separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of correct answers on the math test:\n- The math test has 40 questions.\n- Phillip gets 75% of them right.\n\nTo find 75% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.75:\n\\[\n40 \\times 0.75 = 30\n\\]\n\nSo, Phillip gets 30 questions right on the math test.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of correct answers on the English test:\n- The English test has 50 questions.\n- Phillip gets 98% of them right.\n\nTo find 98% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.98:\n\\[\n50 \\times 0.98 = 49\n\\]\n\nSo, Phillip gets 49 questions right on the English test.\n\nNow, we add the number of correct answers from both tests to find the total number of questions he gets right:\n\\[\n30 + 49 = 79\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of questions Phillip gets right is \\boxed{79}.",
