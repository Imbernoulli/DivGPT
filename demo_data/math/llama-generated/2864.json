He reserved \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the oranges for his friend. So, the number of oranges reserved is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 84 = 21 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n\n3. The number of oranges remaining after reserving some for his friend is:\n   \\[\n   84 - 21 = 63 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n\n4. He sold \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\) of the remaining oranges yesterday. So, the number of oranges sold is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{7} \\times 63 = 27 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n\n5. The number of oranges remaining after selling some yesterday is:\n   \\[\n   63 - 27 = 36 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n\n6. Today, he saw four rotten oranges. So, the number of oranges left to be sold today is:\n   \\[\n   36 - 4 = 32 \\text{ oranges}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of oranges left to be sold today is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
        "First, we calculate the total number of oranges Mr. Salazar initially had. Since he had seven dozen oranges, we multiply 7 by 12:\n\n\\[ 7 \\times 12 = 84 \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many oranges Mr. Salazar reserved for his friend. He reserved \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the oranges, so we calculate:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 84 = 21 \\]\n\nAfter reserving 21 oranges, the number of oranges remaining is:\n\n\\[ 84 - 21 = 63 \\]\n\nThen, Mr. Salazar sold \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\) of the remaining oranges yesterday. We calculate:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{7} \\times 63 = 27 \\]\n\nAfter selling 27 oranges, the number of oranges remaining is:\n\n\\[ 63 - 27 = 36 \\]\n\nToday, Mr. Salazar saw four rotten oranges. Therefore, the number of oranges left to be sold today is:\n\n\\[ 36 - 4 = 32 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]",

        "First, we need to determine the total number of oranges Mr. Salazar initially had. Since he had seven dozen oranges, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 7 \\times 12 = 84 \\]\n\nNext, we find out how many oranges Mr. Salazar reserved for his friend. He reserved \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the oranges, so we calculate:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 84 = 21 \\]\n\nAfter reserving 21 oranges, the number of oranges remaining is:\n\n\\[ 84 - 21 = 63 \\]\n\nMr. Salazar sold \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\) of the remaining oranges yesterday. So, we calculate:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{7} \\times 63 = 27 \\]\n\nAfter selling 27 oranges, the number of oranges remaining is:\n\n\\[ 63 - 27 = 36 \\]\n\nToday, Mr. Salazar saw that 4 oranges were rotten.
