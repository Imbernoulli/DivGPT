        "To determine the number of orange shells Tamtam collected, we start by adding up the number of shells of each color she has already collected. The problem states that Tamtam collected 13 purple shells, 8 pink shells, 18 yellow shells, and 12 blue shells. We can calculate the total number of these shells as follows:\n\n\\[\n13 + 8 + 18 + 12\n\\]\n\nFirst, we add the purple and pink shells:\n\n\\[\n13 + 8 = 21\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the yellow shells:\n\n\\[\n21 + 18 = 39\n\\]\n\nThen, we add the blue shells:\n\n\\[\n39 + 12 = 51\n\\]\n\nSo, Tamtam has collected a total of 51 shells that are purple, pink, yellow, or blue. Since she collected 65 shells in total, the number of orange shells is the difference between the total number of shells and the number of purple, pink, yellow, and blue shells. We can find this difference by subtracting 51 from 65:\n\n\\[\n65 - 51 = 14\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of orange shells is \\boxed{14}.",
