Calculate the amount after the 10% fee:\n   The fee is 10% of the total value, so we need to subtract 10% from $30.00. First, find 10% of $30.00:\n   \\[\n   30.00 \\times 0.10 = 3.00 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Subtract the fee from the total value:\n   \\[\n   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Darrel will receive \\(\\boxed{27}\\) dollars after the 10% fee.",
