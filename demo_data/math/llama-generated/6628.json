        "To determine how many hours Kira was away from home, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much kibble the cat ate.\n2. Determine how many hours it took for the cat to eat that amount of kibble.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much kibble the cat ate. Kira started with 3 pounds of kibble and returned to find 1 pound left. Therefore, the cat ate:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ pounds} - 1 \\text{ pound} = 2 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we know that the cat eats 1 pound of kibble every 4 hours. So, to find out how many hours it took for the cat to eat 2 pounds, we multiply the amount of kibble eaten by the time it takes to eat 1 pound:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ pounds} \\times 4 \\text{ hours per pound} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, Kira was away from home for \\(\\boxed{8}\\) hours.",

To find out how many hours it takes for the cat to eat 2 pounds, we use the following proportion:\n\\[\n\\text{Hours} = \\frac{\\text{Kibble eaten}}{\\text{Kibble per hour}} \\times \\text{Hours per pound} = \\frac{2 \\text{ pounds}}{1 \\text{ pound per 4actice} \\times 4 = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Kira was away from home for \\boxed{8} hours.",
