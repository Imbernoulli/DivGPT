Subtract the time taken to reach the first station from the total commuting time to find the time taken from the first station to work.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the time it takes for Mr. Langsley to reaches the first station.**\n\nThe bus picks Mr. Langsley up at 6:00 a.m. and takes 40 minutes to arrive at the first station. Therefore, he arrives at the first station at:\n\\[ 6:00 \\text{ a.m.} + 40 \\text{ minutes} = 6:40 \\text{ a.m.} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total time Mr. Langsley spends commuting from his home to work.**\n\nMr. Langsley arrives at work at 9:00 a.m. Since he leaves his home at 6:00 a.m., the total commuting time is:\n\\[ 9:00 \\text{ a.m.} - 6:00 \\text{ a.m.} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\nConverting hours to minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the time taken to reach the first station from the total commuting time to find the time taken from the first station to work.**\n\nThe time taken from the first station to work is:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ minutes} - 40 \\text{ minutes} = 140 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThus, the total time taken from the first station to Mr. Langsley's workplace is:\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]",

Subtract the time taken from the bus stop to the first station from the total travel time to find the time taken from the first station to work.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Mr. Langsley arrives at the first station. He解答 the bus at 6:00 a.m. and the bus takes 40 minutes to arrive at the first station. Therefore, he arrives at the first station at:\n\\[ 6:00 \\text{ a.m.} + 40 \\text{ minutes} = 6:40 \\text{ a.m.} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total travel time from when he arrives at the first station to when he arrives at work. Mr. Langsley arrives at work at 9:00 a.m. So, the total travel time from 6:40 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. is:\n\\[ 9:00 \\text{ a.m.} - 6:40 \\text{ a.m.} = 2 \\text{ hours and } 20 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nWe need to convert this time into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 2 hours is equal to:\n\\[ 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nAdding the 20 minutes gives:\n\\[ 120 + 20 = 140 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time taken from the first station to Mr. Langsley's workplace is:\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]",

Calculate the time taken from the bus stop to the first station.\n2. Determine the time taken from the first station to Mr. Langsley's workplace by subtracting the time taken to the first station from the total travel time.\n\nFirst, we know that the bus picks Mr. Langsley up at 6:00 a.m. and takes 40 minutes to arrive at the first station. Therefore, he arrives at the first station at:\n\\[ 6:00 \\text{ a.m.} + 40 \\text{ minutes} = 6:40 \\text{ a.m.} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Mr. Langsley arrives at work at 9:00 a.m. To find out how long it takes from the first station to his workplace, we need to calculate the difference between 9:00 a.m. and 6:40 a.m.:\n\\[ 9:00 \\text{ a.m.} - 6:40 \\text{ a.m.} \\]\n\nTo perform the subtraction, we can break it down as follows:\n- From 6:40 a.m. to 7:40 a.m. is 1 hour.\n- From 7:40 a.m. to 8:40 a.m. is another hour.\n- From 8:40 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. is 20 minutes.\n\nAdding these amounts together, we get:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ hour} + 1 \\text{ hour} + 20 \\text{ minutes} = 2 \\text{ hours} + 20 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSince 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 2 hours is equal to:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nAdding the 20 minutes, we get:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} = 140 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time taken from the first station to Mr. Langsley's workplace is:\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]",

Since 9:00 a.m. is the same as 8:60 a.m., we can subtract 6:40 a.m. from 8:60 a.m.:\n\\[ 8:60 \\text{ a.m.} - 6:40 \\text{ a.m.} = 2:20 \\text{ a.m.} \\]\n\nNow, we convert 2:20 a.m. back to minutes:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} + 20 \\text{ minutes} = 120 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} = 140 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time taken from the first station to Mr. Langsley's workplace is:\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]",
