Subtract the tax amount from her annual earnings.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount of taxes Dorothy owes.**\n\nDorothy earns $60,000 per year and pays 18% of this amount in taxes. To find out how much this is, we multiply her annual earnings by 18%.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Tax amount} = 60,000 \\times \\frac{18}{100}\n\\]\n\nFirst, convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{100} = 0.18\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Tax amount} = 60,000 \\times 0.18 = 10,800\n\\]\n\nSo, Dorothy owes $10,800 in taxes.\n\n**Step 2: Subtract the tax amount from her annual earnings.**\n\nNext, we subtract the tax amount from Dorothy's annual earnings to find out how much money she will have left:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining amount} = 60,000 - 10,800\n\\]\n\nPerform the subtraction:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining amount} = 49,200\n\\]\n\nTherefore, after paying the taxes, Dorothy will have \\boxed{49200} dollars left.",

        "To determine how much money Dorothy will have left after paying taxes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of taxes Dorothy needs to pay.\n2. Subtract the tax amount from her annual salary.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount of taxes Dorothy needs to pay.**\n\nDorothy earns $60,000 per year and needs to pay 18% of this amount in taxes. To find 18% of $60,000, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Tax amount} = \\text{Annual salary} \\times \\text{Tax rate} \\]\n\nHere, the annual salary is $60,000 and the tax rate is 18%, which can be written as 0.18 in decimal form. So, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Tax amount} = 60000 \\times 0.18 \\]\n\nNow, we perform the multiplication:\n\\[ 60000 \\times 0.18 = 10800 \\]\n\nSo, Dorothy needs to pay $10,800 in taxes.\n\n**Step 2: Subtract the tax amount from her annual salary.**\n\nTo find out how much money Dorothy will have left after paying the taxes, we subtract the tax amount from her annual salary:\n\\[ \\text{Money left} = \\text{Annual salary} - \\text{Tax amount} \\]\n\nHere, the annual salary is $60,000 and the tax amount is $10,800. So, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Money left} = 60000 - 10800 \\]\n\nNow, we perform the subtraction:\n\\[ 60000 - 10800 = 49200 \\]\n\nSo, after paying the taxes, Dorothy will have \\(\\boxed{49200}\\) dollars left.",
