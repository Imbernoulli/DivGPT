        "To determine how many eyes saw the airplane, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students who looked up.\n2. Determine the total number of eyes that saw the airplane.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of students who looked up.**\n\nThere were 200 students on the field, and \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of them looked up. So, we multiply the total number of students by \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\):\n\\[\n200 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 200 \\times 0.75 = 150\n\\]\nTherefore, 150 students looked up.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of eyes that saw the airplane.**\n\nEach student has 2 eyes, so the total number of eyes that saw the airplane is:\n\\[\n150 \\times 2 = 300\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of eyes that saw the airplane is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",

        "To determine how many eyes saw the airplane, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students who looked up when the military plane flew by.\n2. Determine how many eyes those students have.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of students who looked up. Since 3/4 of the 200 students looked up, we perform the following multiplication:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 200 = \\frac{3 \\times 200}{4} = \\frac{600}{4} = 150\n\\]\nSo, 150 students looked up.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many eyes these 150 students have. Since each student has 2 eyes, we multiply the number of students by 2:\n\\[\n150 \\times 2 = 300\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of eyes that saw the airplane is \\boxed{300}.",

There were 200 students in total, and \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of them looked up. So, we multiply 200 by \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\):\n\\[\n200 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 200 \\times 0.75 = 150\n\\]\nThis means that 150 students looked up.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many eyes saw the airplane.
