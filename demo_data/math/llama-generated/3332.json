Therefore, her total daily expenses are:\n\\[\n30 + 12 = 42 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pancakes she must sell to cover these $42 expenses. Since each pancake is sold for $2, the number of pancakes she needs to sell is:\n\\[\n\\frac{42}{2} = 21\n\\]\n\nSo, Janina must sell \\(\\boxed{21}\\) pancakes each day to cover her expenses.",

        "To determine how many pancakes Janina must sell each day to cover her expenses, we need to calculate her total daily expenses and then figure out how many pancakes she needs to sell to meet those expenses.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Janina's total daily expenses:\n\\[\n\\text{Total daily expenses} = \\text{Rent} + \\text{Supplies}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total daily expenses} = 30 + 12 = 42\n\\]\nSo, Janina's total daily expenses are $42.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many pancakes she must sell to cover these expenses. Since each pancake is sold for $2, we can find the number of pancakes she needs to sell by dividing her total daily expenses by the price per pancake:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pancakes needed} = \\frac{\\text{Total daily expenses}}{\\text{Price per pancake}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pancakes needed} = \\frac{42}{2} = 21\n\\]\nTherefore, Janina must sell \\(\\boxed{21}\\) pancakes each day to cover her expenses.",
        "To determine how many pancakes Janina must sell each day to cover her expenses, we first need to calculate her total daily expenses. Janina's daily expenses include her rent and the cost of supplies.\n\nThe daily rent is $30, and the daily cost of supplies is $12. Therefore, her total daily expenses are:\n\\[ 30 + 12 = 42 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pancakes she must sell to cover these expenses. Since each pancake is sold for $2, the number of pancakes she needs to sell each day can be calculated by dividing her total daily expenses by the price per pancake:\n\\[ \\frac{42}{2} = 21 \\]\n\nThus, Janina must sell \\(\\boxed{21}\\) pancakes each day to cover her expenses."
