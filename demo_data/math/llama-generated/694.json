        "To determine how many marbles Merill has, we start by defining the number of marbles each person has in terms of variables. Let's denote the number of marbles Elliot has as \\( E \\). According to the problem, Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot, so Merill has \\( 2E \\) marbles. Selma has fifty marbles, which we can write as \\( S = 50 \\).\n\nThe problem also states that the total number of marbles Merill and Elliot have together is five fewer than the number of marbles Selma has. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\\[ 2E + E = S - 5 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( S \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 2E + E = 50 - 5 \\]\n\\[ 3E = 45 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( E \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ E = \\frac{45}{3} \\]\n\\[ E = 15 \\]\n\nNow that we know Elliot has 15 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Merill has by calculating \\( 2E \\):\n\\[ 2E = 2 \\times 15 = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, Merill has \\(\\boxed{30}\\) marbles.",

        "To determine how many marbles Merill has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of marbles Selma has.\n2. Use the information to find out how many marbles Merill and Elliot have together.\n3. Set up an equation to find out how many marbles Merill has.\n\nFirst, we know that Selma has 50 marbles. According to the problem, Merill and Elliot together have five fewer marbles than Selma. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of marbles Merill and Elliot have together as follows:\n\\[ 50 - 5 = 45 \\]\nSo, Merill and Elliot together have 45 marbles.\n\nNext, let's denote the number of marbles Elliot has as \\( E \\). Since Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot, Merill has \\( 2E \\) marbles. The total number of marbles Merill and Elliot have together is the sum of Merill's marbles and Elliot's marbles:\n\\[ 2E + E = 3E \\]\nWe already know that this total is 45 marbles, so we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 3E = 45 \\]\nTo find \\( E \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ E = \\frac{45}{3} = 15 \\]\nSo, Elliot has 15 marbles.

According to the problem, Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   M = 2E\n   \\]\n\n3. The problem also states that Merill and Elliot together have five fewer marbles than Selma. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   M + E = S - 5\n   \\]\n\n4. We know that Selma has fifty marbles, so we substitute \\( S = 50 \\) into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   M + E = 50 - 5\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right side, we get:\n   \\[\n   M + E = 45\n   \\]\n\n5. Now we have a system of two equations:\n   \\[\n   M = 2E\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   M + E = 45\n   \\]\n\n6. Substitute \\( M = 2E \\) into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   2E + E = 45\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   3E = 45\n   \\]\n\n7.

Now that we know \\( E = 15 \\), we can find \\( M \\) by substituting \\( E = 15 \\) back into the first equation:\n   \\[\n   M = 2E = 2 \\times 15 = 30\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Merill has \\(\\boxed{30}\\) marbles.",
