Her junior, Naomi, takes 1/4 times more time to complete creating a similar website. If many clients required her to build their websites in a particular year, and she gave her junior 30 websites to develop, calculate the total number of hours Katherine's junior took to create the 30 websites.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total number of hours Naomi took to create the 30 websites, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the time Naomi takes to develop one website:**\n   - Katherine takes 20 hours to develop one website.\n   - Naomi takes \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) times more time than Katherine.\n\n   First, find \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of Katherine's time:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 = 5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n   Add this to Katherine's time to find Naomi's total time:\n   \\[\n   20 + 5 = 25 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n   So, Naomi takes 25 hours to develop one website.\n\n2. **Calculate the total time Naomi takes to develop 30 websites:**\n   - Naomi takes 25 hours for one website.\n   - She has 30 websites to develop.\n\n   Multiply the time per website by the number of websites:\n   \\[\n   25 \\times 30 = 750 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Katherine's junior took to create the 30 websites is \\(\\boxed{750}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of hours Katherine's junior took to create the 30 websites, we first need to calculate how long it takes Naomi to develop one website.\n\nKatherine takes 20 hours to develop a website. Naomi takes \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) times more time than Katherine. This means Naomi takes \\( 20 + \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 \\) hours to develop one website.
