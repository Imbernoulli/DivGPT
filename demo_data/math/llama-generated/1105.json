Dorothy and her younger brother each pay $7, so the cost for them is:\n\\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe cost for Dorothy's parents and her grandfather is the regular price of $10 each. Since there are 3 people in this group, the cost for them is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the cost of the tickets for Dorothy, her younger brother, and her parents and grandfather gives us the total cost of the trip:\n\\[ 14 + 30 = 44 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nDorothy currently has $70. After spending $44 on the trip, the amount of money she will have left is:\n\\[ 70 - 44 = 26 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Dorothy will have after the trip is:\n\\[ \\boxed{26} \\]",
        "To determine how much money Dorothy will have after her trip to the museum, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract this amount from her current savings.\n\nFirst, let's identify who in Dorothy's family qualifies for the discount and who does not. The regular ticket cost is $10, and people 18 years old or younger get a 30% discount.\n\n- Dorothy is 15 years old, so she qualifies for the discount.\n- Dorothy's younger brother is also 18 years old or younger, so he qualifies for the discount.\n- Dorothy's parents do not qualify for the discount.\n- Dorothy's grandfather does not qualify for the discount.\n\nNext, we calculate the discounted ticket price for Dorothy and her younger brother:\n\\[ \\text{Discounted ticket price} = \\$10 \\times (1 - 0.30) = \\$10 \\times 0.70 = \\$7 \\]\n\nSince Dorothy and her younger brother both get the discount, the total cost for their tickets is:\n\\[ 2 \\times \\$7 = \\$14 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for the tickets for Dorothy's parents and her grandfather. Since they do not qualify for the discount, each ticket costs the regular price of $10. Therefore, the total cost for their tickets is:\n\\[ 3 \\times \\$10 = \\$30 \\]\n\nAdding the cost of all the tickets together, we get the total cost of the trip:\n\\[ \\$14 + \\$30 = \\$44 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total cost of the trip from Dorothy's current savings to find out how much money she will have left:\n\\[ \\$70 - \\$44 = \\$26 \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Dorothy will have after the trip is:\n\\[ \\boxed{26} \\]",
