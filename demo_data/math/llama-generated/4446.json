        "To determine how many acorns the squirrel has to eat at the beginning of spring, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial number of acorns per month:**\n   The squirrel stashed a total of 210 acorns and divided them into thirds.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{210}{3} = 70\n   \\]\n   So, each month initially had 70 acorns.\n\n2. **Determine the number of acorns taken from each month:**\n   The squirrel left 60 acorns for each winter month.
