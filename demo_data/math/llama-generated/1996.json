        "To determine how much water Tony drank two days ago, we start by letting \\( x \\) represent the amount of water he drank two days ago. According to the problem, the amount of water he drank yesterday, which is 48 ounces, is 4% less than what he drank two days ago. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n\n\\[ 48 = x - 0.04x \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 48 = 0.96x \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.96:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{48}{0.96} \\]\n\nPerforming the division, we get:\n\n\\[ x = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of water Tony drank two days ago is \\(\\boxed{50}\\) ounces.",
