        "To determine Diaz's age 20 years from now, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.\n\nLet \\( D \\) be Diaz's current age. According to the problem, 40 less than 10 times Diaz's age is 20 more than 10 times Sierra's age. Sierra's current age is given as 30 years old. We can write the equation as:\n\\[ 10D - 40 = 10 \\times 30 + 20 \\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 10D - 40 = 300 + 20 \\]\n\\[ 10D - 40 = 320 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( D \\) by adding 40 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 10D = 360 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( D \\) by dividing both sides by 10:\n\\[ D = 36 \\]\n\nSo, Diaz is currently 36 years old.

        "To determine Diaz's current age, we start by setting up the equation based on the given information. Let \\( D \\) represent Diaz's current age and \\( S \\) represent Sierra's current age. According to the problem, Sierra is currently 30 years old, so \\( S = 30 \\).\n\nThe problem states that 40 less than 10 times Diaz's age is 20 more than 10 times Sierra's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\\[ 10D - 40 = 10S + 20 \\]\n\nNext, we substitute the value of \\( S \\) into the equation:\n\\[ 10D - 40 = 10(30) + 20 \\]\n\\[ 10D - 40 = 300 + 20 \\]\n\\[ 10D - 40 = 320 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( D \\), we add 40 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 10D = 360 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 10:\n\\[ D = 36 \\]\n\nSo, Diaz is currently 36 years old. To find out how old Diaz will be 20 years from now, we add 20 to Diaz's current age:\n\\[ 36 + 20 = 56 \\]\n\nTherefore, Diaz will be \\(\\boxed{56}\\) years old 20 years from now.",
