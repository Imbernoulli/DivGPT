cost per contact for the box with 50 contacts for $25:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per contact} = \\frac{25}{50} = 0.50 \\text{ dollars per contact}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost per contact for the box with 99 contacts for $33:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per contact} = \\frac{33}{99} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333 \\text{ dollars per contact}\n\\]\n\nNow, we compare the two costs per contact:\n- The box with 50 contacts costs $0.50 per contact.\n- The box with 99 contacts costs $0.3333 per contact.\n\nSince $0.3333 is less than $0.50, Adrian will choose the box with 99 contacts for $33.\n\nTo find out how many contacts it takes to equal $1 worth in the box he decides to buy, we need to divide $1 by the cost per contact for the box with 99 contacts:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of contacts per dollar} =
