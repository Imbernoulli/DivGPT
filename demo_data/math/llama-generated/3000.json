        "To determine the total soaking time required for Bill's clothes, we need to calculate the time needed for each type of stain separately and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time needed to soak the clothes for the grass stains. Bill has 3 grass stains, and each grass stain requires 4 minutes to soak. Therefore, the total time for the grass stains is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ grass stains} \\times 4 \\text{ minutes per grass stain} = 12 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the time needed to soak the clothes for the marinara stain.
