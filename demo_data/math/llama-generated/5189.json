        "To determine how many bananas Katherine has, we start by calculating the number of pears she has.根据 the problem, Katherine has 3 times as many pears as apples. Since she has 4 apples, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\]\n\nSo, Katherine has 12 pears. Next, we know the total number of pieces of fruit in her fridge is 21. This total includes apples, pears, and bananas. We can represent the number of bananas as \\( B \\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of pieces of fruit:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{ (apples)} + 12 \\text{ (pears)} + B \\text{ (bananas)} = 21 \\]\n\nTo find \\( B \\), we simplify the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 16 + B = 21 \\]\n\nThen, we isolate \\( B \\) by subtracting 16 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ B = 21 - 16 \\]\n\\[ B = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the number of bananas Katherine has is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
