        "To determine how much Peter can save by buying the math textbooks from bookshops outside the school instead of the school's bookshop, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of one math textbook in bookshops outside the school.\n2. Calculate the total cost of 3 math textbooks in the school's bookshop.\n3. Calculate the total cost of 3 math textbooks in bookshops outside the school.\n4. Find the difference between the total costs from the school's bookshop and bookshops outside the school.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of one math textbook in bookshops outside the school. The school's bookshop price is $45, and bookshops outside the school offer a 20% discount. Therefore, the discount amount per textbook is:\n\\[ 45 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 45 \\times 0.20 = 9 \\]\nSo, the price per textbook in bookshops outside the school is:\n\\[ 45 - 9 = 36 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of 3 math textbooks in the school's bookshop:\n\\[ 45 \\times 3 = 135 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total cost of 3 math textbooks in bookshops outside the school:\n\\[ 36 \\times 3 = 108 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the total costs from the school's bookshop and bookshops outside the school to determine how much Peter can save:\n\\[ 135 - 108 = 27 \\]\n\nTherefore, Peter can save \\(\\boxed{27}\\) dollars by buying the math textbooks from bookshops outside the school.",

Calculate the total cost of 3 math textbooks in bookshops outside the school.\n4. Find the difference between the total cost in the school's bookshop and the total cost in bookshops outside the school.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the price of one math textbook in bookshops outside the school.**\n\nThe price of a math textbook in the school bookshop is $45.

Therefore, the total cost for 3 textbooks is:\n\\[\n45 \\times 3 = 135\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of 3 math textbooks in bookshops outside the school.**\n\nThe price of one math textbook in bookshops outside the school is $36.

To find the price of one math textbook in bookshops outside the school, we calculate 20% of $45 and subtract it from $45.\n\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } 45 = 0.20 \\times 45 = 9 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Price of one math textbook in bookshops outside the school} = 45 - 9 = 36 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of 3 math textbooks in the school bookshop.\n\\[ \\text{Total cost in the school bookshop} = 45 \\times 3 = 135 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total cost of 3 math textbooks in bookshops outside the school.\n\\[ \\text{Total cost in bookshops outside the school} = 36 \\times 3 = 108 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the total cost in the school bookshop and the total cost in bookshops outside the school.\n\\[ \\text{Savings} = 135 - 108 = 27 \\]\n\nTherefore, Peter can save \\(\\boxed{27}\\) dollars by buying the math textbooks from bookshops outside the school rather than the school's.",

Find the difference between the total cost in the school bookshop and the total cost in bookshops outside the school.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the price of one math textbook in bookshops outside the school.**\n\nThe price of a math textbook in the school bookshop is $45.

Therefore, we need to find 20% of $45 and subtract it from $45.\n\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } 45 = 0.20 \\times 45 = 9 \\]\n\nSo, the price of one math textbook in bookshops outside the school is:\n\n\\[ 45 - 9 = 36 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of 3 math textbooks in the school bookshop.**\n\nThe price of one math textbook in the school bookshop is $45.
