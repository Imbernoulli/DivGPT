        "To determine how many more vacation days Andrew can still take, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of vacation days Andrew earns for working 300 days.\n2. Determine the total number of vacation days Andrew has taken.\n3. Subtract the total number of vacation days taken from the total number of vacation days earned.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of vacation days earned.**\n\nAndrew earns 1 vacation day for every 10 days worked. Therefore, for 300 days worked, the total number of vacation days earned is:\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{10} = 30\n\\]\nSo, Andrew earns 30 vacation days.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of vacation days taken.**\n\nAndrew took 5 days off in March and twice as many in September. Since twice as many days were taken in September as in March, the number of days taken in September is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 5 = 10\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of vacation days taken is:\n\\[\n5 + 10 = 15\n\\]\nSo, Andrew has taken 15 vacation days.\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the total number of vacation days taken from the total number of vacation days earned.**\n\nThe number of vacation days Andrew can still take is:\n\\[\n30 - 15 = 15\n\\]\nSo, Andrew can still take \\boxed{15} vacation days.",
