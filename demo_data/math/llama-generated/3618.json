        "To determine the mile times for Tony, Tina, and Tom, we start by identifying the given information and relationships between their running speeds.\n\n1. **Tina's Mile Time:**\n   Tina runs a mile in 6 minutes.\n\n2. **Tom's Mile Time:**\n   Tina is one-third as fast as Tom. This means Tom runs a mile three times faster than Tina.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tom's time} = \\frac{\\text{Tina's time}}{3} = \\frac{6 \\text{ minutes}}{3} = 2 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Tony's Mile Time:**\n   Tony can run a mile twice as fast as Tina. This means Tony runs a mile half as long as Tina.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tony's time} = \\frac{\\text{Tina's time}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\text{ minutes}}{2} = 3 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum of Their Mile Times:**\n   To find the total time for all three runners, we add their individual mile times together.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\text{Tom's time} + \\text{Tina's time} + \\text{Tony's time} = 2 \\text{ minutes} + 6 \\text{ minutes} + 3 \\text{ minutes} = 11 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the sum of all three of their mile times is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
        "To determine the mile times for Tony, Tina, and Tom, we start by identifying the time it takes for each runner to complete a mile.\n\nFirst, we know that Tina's mile time is 6 minutes. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Tina's time} = 6 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we are given that Tina is one-third as fast a runner as Tom. This means that Tom's mile time is one-third of Tina's time. Thus, we calculate Tom's time as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Tom's time} = \\frac{6 \\text{ minutes}}{3} = 2 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nWe also know that Tony can run a mile twice as fast as Tina. This means that Tony's mile time is half of Tina's time. Thus, we calculate Tony's time as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Tony's time} = \\frac{6 \\text{ minutes}}{2} = 3 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we add the mile times for Tony, Tina, and Tom to find the total time:\n\\[ \\text{Total time} = \\text{Tony's time} + \\text{Tina's time} + \\text{Tom's time} = 3 \\text{ minutes} + 6 \\text{ minutes} + 2 \\text{ minutes} = 11 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total of all three of their mile times when added together is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]",

Therefore, Tony's mile time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tony's time} = \\frac{\\text{Tina's time}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\text{ minutes}}{2} = 3 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum of Theirueblo Times:**\n   To find the total mile times for Tony, Tina, and Tom, we add their individual times together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\text{Tony's time} + \\text{Tina's time} + \\text{Tom's time} = 3 \\text{ minutes} + 6 \\text{ minutes} + 2 \\text{ minutes} = 11 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the sum of all three of their mile times is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
        "To determine the mile times for Tony, Tina, and Tom, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Tina's mile time:**\n   Tina's mile time is given as 6 minutes.\n\n2. **Determine Tom's mile time:**\n   Tina is one-third as fast a runner as Tom. This means Tom runs a mile in one-third of the time it takes Tina.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tom's time} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 \\text{ minutes} = 2 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Tony's mile time:**\n   Tony can run a mile twice as fast as Tina.
