        "To determine how many students in the class are going to the regional chess tournament, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of students in the chess program:**\n   - There are 24 students in total.\n   - One-third of the students are in the chess program.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students in the chess program} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 24 = 8\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many students will be absent for the tournament:**\n   - Half of the students in the chess program will be absent.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students absent} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = 4\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students in the class going to the regional chess tournament is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

        "To determine how many students in the class are going to the regional chess tournament, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students in the after-school chess program.\n2. Determine how many of these students will be absent for the tournament.\n\nFirst, we find the number of students in the after-school chess program. Since one-third of the 24 students are in the program, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 24 = 8\n\\]\nSo, there are 8 students in the after-school chess program.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these 8 students will be absent for the regional chess tournament. Since half of the students in the chess program will be absent, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = 4\n\\]\nSo, 4 students will be absent for the tournament.\n\nTherefore, the number of students in this class who are going to the tournament is \\boxed{4}.",

Determine how many of those students will be absent for the tournament.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of students in the chess program.**\n\nThe class has 24 students, and one-third of them are in the chess program. Therefore, we multiply the total number of students by one-third:\n\\[\n24 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 8\n\\]\nSo, there are 8 students in the chess program.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many of those students will be absent for the tournament.**\n\nHalf of the students in the chess program will be absent for the tournament. Therefore, we multiply the number of students in the chess program by one-half:\n\\[\n8 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 4\n\\]\nSo, 4 students will be absent for the tournament.\n\nThus, the number of students in this class going to the tournament is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
