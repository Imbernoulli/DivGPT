        "To determine the cost of John's color drawing, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the cost of the black and white drawing:**\n   The black and white drawing costs $160.\n\n2. **Calculate the additional cost for a color drawing:**\n   A color drawing is 50% more expensive than a black and white drawing. To find 50% of $160, we use the following calculation:\n   \\[\n   0.50 \\times 160 = 80\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add the additional cost to the original cost:**\n   The total cost of the color drawing is the sum of the original cost and the additional cost:\n   \\[\n   160 + 80 = 240\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, John paid \\(\\boxed{240}\\) dollars for his color drawing.",
