        "To determine how many houses Jackson needs to visit on each of the remaining days of the week to meet his goal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Jackson has already earned on Monday and Tuesday.\n2. Determine how much more money he needs to earn to meet his goal.\n3. Calculate how much money Jackson needs to earn on average each of the remaining days.\n4. Determine how many houses he needs to visit on each of the remaining days to earn the required amount of money.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of money Jackson has already earned on Monday and Tuesday:\n\\[ 300 + 40 = 340 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how much more money Jackson needs to earn to meet his goal of $1000:\n\\[ 1000 - 340 = 660 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nJackson works 5 days a week, and he has already worked 2 days. Therefore, he has 3 days left. To find out how much money he needs to earn on average each of the remaining days, we divide the remaining amount of money by the number of days left:\n\\[ \\frac{660}{3} = 220 \\text{ dollars per day} \\]\n\nJackson earns an average of $10 for every 4 houses he visits. To find out how many houses he needs to visit to earn $220, we set up the following proportion:\n\\[ \\frac{10}{4} = \\frac{220}{x} \\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of houses he needs to visit. Solving for \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[ 10x = 220 \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ 10x = 880 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{880}{10} \\]\n\\[ x = 88 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jackson needs to visit \\(\\boxed{88}\\) houses on each of the remaining days of the week to meet his goal.",

Calculate the amount of money Jackson needs to earn each day for the remaining days.\n4. Determine how many houses Jackson needs to visit each day to earn the required amount of money.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Jackson has earned so far.**\n\nJackson earned $300 on Monday and $40 on Tuesday.\n\\[ 300 + 40 = 340 \\]\n\nSo, Jackson has earned $340 so far.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much more money Jackson needs to earn to meet his goal.**\n\nJackson's goal is to raise $1000.

Jackson earns $10 for every 4 houses he visits. Therefore, his earnings per house is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{4} = 2.5\n   \\]\n   So, Jackson earns $2.50 per house.\n\n4.

Jackson works 5 days a week and has already worked 2 days (Monday and Tuesday). Therefore, he has 3 days left to work.\n   \\[\n   5 - 2 = 3\n   \\]\n   So, he has 3 days left.\n\n6. To find out how many houses he needs to visit each day, we divide the total number of houses by the number of remaining days.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{264}{3} = 88\n   \\]\n   So, Jackson needs to visit 88 houses each day.\n\nTherefore, the number of houses Jackson will have to visit on each of the remaining days of the week to meet his goal is \\boxed{88}.",
