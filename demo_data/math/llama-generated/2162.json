        "To determine the total time Tony spent solving puzzles, we need to add the time he spent on the warm-up puzzle and the time he spent on the two more difficult puzzles.\n\nFirst, we know that the warm-up puzzle took 10 minutes. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Time for warm-up puzzle} = 10 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we know that each of the two more difficult puzzles took 3 times as long as the warm-up puzzle. Therefore, each of these puzzles took:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSince there are two such puzzles, the total time spent on these two puzzles is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we add the time spent on the warm-up puzzle to the time spent on the two more difficult puzzles to find the total time spent solving all the puzzles:\n\\[ 10 + 60 = 70 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThus, the total time Tony spent solving puzzles is:\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]",

First, we know that Tony did a warm-up puzzle that took 10 minutes.\n2. Next, he did 2 puzzles that each took 3 times as long as the warm-up puzzle. Since the warm-up puzzle took 10 minutes, each of these puzzles took \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\) minutes.\n3. Therefore, the total time spent on the 2 puzzles is \\(30 \\times 2 = 60\\) minutes.\n4.
