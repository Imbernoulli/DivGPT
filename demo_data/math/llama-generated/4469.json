Most recently, he painted a mural of a pack of wolves standing on a snowy-white mountainside underneath a full moon.  He put the painting up for auction and it sold for $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting.  If he received $44,000 for the sale of his most recent painting, how much, in dollars, did he make for selling his previous painting?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how much Porter made for selling his previous painting, let's denote the amount he made from his previous painting as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the amount he received for his most recent painting is $1000 less than five times the amount he made from his previous painting. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n\n\\[ 44000 = 5x - 1000 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve this equation step by step. First, we add 1000 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 44000 + 1000 = 5x \\]\n\\[ 45000 = 5x \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 5 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{45000}{5} \\]\n\\[ x = 9000 \\]\n\nTherefore, Porter made \\(\\boxed{9000}\\) dollars for selling his previous painting.",
