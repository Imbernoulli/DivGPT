        "Let's denote John's current age by \\( x \\). According to the problem, 9 years from now, John's age will be \\( x + 9 \\). Also, 11 years ago, John's age was \\( x - 11 \\). The problem states that 9 years from now, John will be 3 times as old as he was 11 years ago. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\\[\nx + 9 = 3(x - 11)\n\\]\nNext, we need to solve this equation for \\( x \\). First, we expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[\nx + 9 = 3x - 33\n\\]\nThen, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting \\( x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n9 = 2x - 33\n\\]\nNext, we add 33 to both sides to further isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n\\[\n42 = 2x\n\\]\nFinally, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 21\n\\]\nTherefore, John's current age is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
