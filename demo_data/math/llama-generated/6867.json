Add up the times from all three tasks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time spent making coffee. Kim spends 5 minutes making coffee.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time spent getting status updates. Kim spends 2 minutes per employee getting a status update. Since there are 9 employees, the total time spent getting status updates is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ minutes/employee} \\times 9 \\text{ employees} = 18 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the time spent updating payroll records. Kim spends 3 minutes per employee updating payroll records. Since there are 9 employees, the total time spent updating payroll records is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ minutes/employee} \\times 9 \\text{ employees} = 27 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we add up the times from all three tasks:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ minutes} + 18 \\text{ minutes} + 27 \\text{ minutes} = 50 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Kim's morning routine takes is \\(\\boxed{50}\\) minutes.",
