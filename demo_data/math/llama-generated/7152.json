Calculate the amount of flour Wendi brought.\n3. Calculate the amount of flour Carrie brought.\n4. Find the difference between the amount of flour Carrie brought and the amount of flour Katy brought.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount of flour Katy brought.**\n\nKaty brought three 5-pound bags of flour.\n\\[\n3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the amount of flour Wendi brought.**\n\nWendi brought twice as much flour as Katy.\n\\[\n2 \\times 15 = 30 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the amount of flour Carrie brought.**\n\nCarrie brought 5 pounds less than the amount of flour Wendi brought.\n\\[\n30 - 5 = 25 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the difference between the amount of flour Carrie brought and the amount of flour Katy brought.**\n\nFirst, convert the weights from pounds to ounces. There are 16 ounces in a pound.\n\nKaty's flour in ounces:\n\\[\n15 \\times 16 = 240 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nCarrie's flour in ounces:\n\\[\n25 \\times 16 = 400 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nNow, find the difference:\n\\[\n400 - 240 = 160 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nThus, Carrie brought \\(\\boxed{160}\\) more ounces of flour than Katy."
