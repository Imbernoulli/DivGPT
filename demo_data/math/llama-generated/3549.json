        "To determine the total time Tod drove, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance Tod drove.\n2. Determine the total time based on the distance and Tod's constant speed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Tod drove. Tod drove 55 miles to the north and 95 miles to the west. Therefore, the total distance is the sum of these two distances:\n\\[\n55 \\text{ miles} + 95 \\text{ miles} = 150 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total time Tod drove. Tod's constant speed is 25 miles per hour.
