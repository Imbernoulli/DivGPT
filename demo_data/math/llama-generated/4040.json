        "To determine the total number of beats John plays, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of beats John plays in one day.\n2. Multiply the number of beats he plays in one day by the number of days he plays.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many beats John plays in one day. John plays 200 beats per minute and he plays for 2 hours each day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of beats he plays in one day as follows:\n\n\\[ 200 \\text{ beats/minute} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 200 \\times 2 \\times 60 = 24000 \\text{ beats/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many beats John plays in 3 days. Since he plays 24000 beats each day, we multiply the number of beats he plays in one day by 3:\n\n\\[ 24000 \\text{ beats/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 72000 \\text{ beats} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of beats John plays is \\(\\boxed{72000}\\).",

Multiply the number of beats he plays in one day by the number of days he plays.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of beats John plays in one day.**\n\nJohn plays 200 beats per minute. First, we need to find out how many minutes he plays in one day. He plays for 2 hours each day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes he plays in one day as follows:\n\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \\text{ minutes/day} \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total number of beats he plays in one day by multiplying the number of minutes he plays by the number of beats per minute:\n\n\\[ 200 \\text{ beats/minute} \\times 120 \\text{ minutes/day} = 24000 \\text{ beats/day} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Multiply the number of beats he plays in one day by the number of days he plays.**\n\nJohn plays for 3 days. To find the total number of beats he plays over the 3 days, we multiply the number of beats he plays in one day by the number of days:\n\n\\[ 24000 \\text{ beats/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 72000 \\text{ beats} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of beats John plays is \\(\\boxed{72000}\\).",
