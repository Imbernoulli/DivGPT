        "To determine how many minnows will be left over, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people who win a prize.\n2. Determine the total number of minnows used for the prizes.\n3. Subtract the number of minnows used from the total number of minnows bought.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of people who win a prize. Since 15% of the 800 people win a prize, we have:\n\\[\n0.15 \\times 800 = 120\n\\]\nSo, 120 people win a prize.\n\nNext, determine the total number of minnows used for the prizes. Since each prize consists of 3 minnows, the total number of minnows used is:\n\\[\n120 \\times 3 = 360\n\\]\nSo, 360 minnows are used.\n\nFinally, subtract the number of minnows used from the total number of minnows bought to find out how many minnows will be left over:\n\\[\n600 - 360 = 240\n\\]\nSo, the number of minnows left over is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{240}\n\\]",
