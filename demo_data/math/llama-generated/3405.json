        "To determine the cost of each pack of candy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money James spent on the candy.\n2. Determine the cost of each pack of candy.\n\nFirst, we know that James paid with a $20 bill and received $11 in change. Therefore, the total amount of money he spent on the candy is:\n\\[ 20 - 11 = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we know that James bought 3 packs of candy. To find the cost of each pack, we divide the total amount spent by the number of packs:\n\\[ 9 \\div 3 = 3 \\text{ dollars per pack} \\]\n\nThus, the cost of each pack of candy is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of each pack of candy, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount James spent on the candy:**\n   James pays with a $20 bill and gets $11 change. Therefore, the total amount he spent is:\n   \\[\n   20 - 11 = 9 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the cost per pack of candy:**\n   James bought 3 packs of candy. Let \\( x \\) be the cost of each pack. Since the total cost for 3 packs is $9, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   3x = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   To find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{9}{3} = 3\n   \\]\n\nThus, the cost of each pack of candy is \\(\\boxed{3}\\) dollars.",
