The scores are 50, 70, and 66. The average is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of the scores}}{\\text{Number of scores}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{50 + 70 + 66}{3} = \\frac{186}{3} = 62\n\\]\n\nSo, Henry's History score is 62.
