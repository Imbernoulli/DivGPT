        "To find the total number of college courses Max and Sid attended, we start by determining the number of courses Sid attended. We know that Sid attended four times as many college courses as Max. Since Max attended 40 courses, we calculate the number of courses Sid attended as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of courses Sid attended} = 4 \\times 40 = 160\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the number of courses Max attended to the number of courses Sid attended to find the total number of courses they both attended:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of courses} = 40 + 160 = 200\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of college courses they both attended is \\boxed{200}.",

Sid attended four times as many college courses as Max. Therefore, we calculate the number of college courses Sid attended as follows:\n\\[\n4 \\times 40 = 160\n\\]\nSo, Sid attended 160 college courses.\n\nNext, we add the number of college courses Max attended to the number of college courses Sid attended:\n\\[\n40 + 160 = 200\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of college courses they both attended is \\boxed{200}.",
