        "To determine how many miles Jerome will ride on the 13th day, we start by calculating the total number of miles he will have ridden after 12 days. Since he rides 12 miles each day for 12 days, we multiply the number of miles per day by the number of days:\n\n\\[ 12 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 12 \\text{ days} = 144 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total number of miles he has ridden after 12 days from the total length of the trip to find out how many miles he has left to ride on the 13th day:\n\n\\[ 150 \\text{ miles} - 144 \\text{ miles} = 6 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jerome will ride \\(\\boxed{6}\\) miles on the 13th day to finish his goal.",
