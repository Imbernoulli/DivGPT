Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today.

        "To determine how many sentences Janice started with today, we need to calculate the total number of sentences she typed today and then subtract this from the final total of 536 sentences.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Janice spent typing today:\n\n1.
