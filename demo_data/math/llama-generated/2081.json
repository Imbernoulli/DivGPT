        "To determine how many lilies Martha will put in each centerpiece, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of roses needed:**\n   Each centerpiece uses 8 roses, and there are 6 centerpieces.\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ roses/centerpiece} \\times 6 \\text{ centerpieces} = 48 \\text{ roses}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of orchids needed:**\n   Each centerpiece uses twice as many orchids as roses. Since each centerpiece uses 8 roses, each centerpiece uses:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 8 \\text{ roses} = 16 \\text{ orchids}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total number of orchids needed is:\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ orchids/centerpiece} \\times 6 \\text{ centerpieces} = 96 \\text{ orchids}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Let \\( L \\) be the number of lilies per centerpiece.**\n   The total number of lilies needed is:\n   \\[\n   L \\text{ lilies/centerpiece} \\times 6 \\text{ centerpieces} = 6L \\text{ lilies}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of the roses:**\n   Each rose costs $15, so the total cost of the roses is:\n   \\[\n   48 \\text{ roses} \\times 15 \\text{ dollars/rose} = 720 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost of the orchids:**\n   Each orchid costs $15, so the total cost of the orchids is:\n   \\[\n   96 \\text{ orchids} \\times 15 \\text{ dollars/orchid} = 1440 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total cost of the lilies:**\n   Each lily costs $15, so the total cost of the lilies is:\n   \\[\n   6L \\text{ lilies} \\times 15 \\text{ dollars/lily} = 90L \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Set up the equation for the total cost:**\n   The total cost of all the flowers is $2700. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   720 \\text{ dollars} + 1440 \\text{ dollars} + 90L \\text{ dollars} = 2700 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n8. **Solve for \\( L \\):**\n   Combine the natural gas cost terms:\n   \\[\n   2160 \\text{ dollars} + 90L \\text{ dollars} = 2700 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Subtract 2160 dollars from both sides:\n   \\[\n   90L \\text{ dollars} = 540 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 90:\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{540}{90} = 6\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Martha will put \\(\\boxed{6}\\) lilies in each centerpiece.",

Calculate the total number of lilies used in all centerpieces.\n5. Determine the number of lilies per centerpiece.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses and orchids used in all centerpieces.**\n\n- Each centerpiece uses 8 roses.\n- There are 6 centerpieces.\n- Therefore, the total number of roses is \\(8 \\times 6 = 48\\).\n\n- Each centerpiece uses twice as many orchids as roses.\n- So, each centerpiece uses \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\) orchids.\n- Therefore, the total number of orchids is \\(16 \\times 6 = 96\\).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total cost of the roses and orchids.**\n\n- Each rose costs $15.\n- So, the total cost of the roses is \\(48 \\times 15 = 720\\).\n- Each orchid costs $15.\n- So, the total cost of the orchids is \\(96 \\times 15 = 1440\\).\n- Therefore, the total cost of the roses and orchids is \\(720 + 1440 = 2160\\).\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the cost of the roses and orchids from the total amount Martha wants to spend to find the total cost of the lilies.**\n\n- Martha wants to spend $2700 in total.\n- So, the total cost of the lilies is \\(2700 - 2160 = 540\\).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of lilies used in all centerpieces.**\n\n- Let \\(L\\) be the number of lilies per centerpiece.\n- Therefore, the total number of lilies is \\(6L\\).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of lilies per centerpiece.**\n\n- Each lily costs $15.\n- So, the total cost of the lilies is \\(15 \\times 6L = 90L\\).\n- We know that the total cost of the lilies is $540.\n- Therefore, \\(90L = 540\\).\n- Solving for \\(L\\), we get \\(L = \\frac{540}{90} = 6\\).\n\nSo, Martha will put \\(\\boxed{6}\\) lilies in each centerpiece.",
