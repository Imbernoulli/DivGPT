        "To determine how many more days John must work before he makes twice his current amount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate John's daily earnings:**\n   John has worked for 10 days and made $250. Therefore, his daily earnings are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily earnings} = \\frac{\\$250}{10} = \\$25 \\text{ per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the target amount:**\n   John wants to make twice his current amount. Therefore, the target amount is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Target amount} = 2 \\times \\$250 = \\$500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the additional amount needed:**\n   John has already made $250, so the additional amount he needs to make is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional amount needed} = \\$500 - \\$250 = \\$250\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of additional days required:**\n   Since John earns $25 per day, the number of additional days he needs to work to make $250 is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional days} = \\frac{\\$250}{\\$25 \\text{ per day}} = 10 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, John must work \\(\\boxed{10}\\) more days before he makes twice his current amount.",

Therefore, his daily earnings are:\n\\[\n\\text{Daily earnings} = \\frac{250}{10} = 25 \\text{ dollars per day}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the total amount John wants to make. He wants to make twice the amount he has already made. So, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount needed} = 2 \\times 250 = 500 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate how many more days John needs to work to make the remaining amount. John has already made $250, so he needs:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining amount needed} = 500 - 250 = 250 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSince John makes $25 per day, the number of additional days he needs to work is:\n\\[\n\\text{Additional days needed} = \\frac{250}{25} = 10 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, John must work \\boxed{10} more days to make twice the amount he has already made.",
