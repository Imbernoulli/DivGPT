        "To determine the total number of notebooks in the classroom, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students have 5 notebooks each. Since half of the 28 students have 5 notebooks each, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{28}{2} = 14\n\\]\nSo, 14 students have 5 notebooks each. Therefore, the total number of notebooks these 14 students have is:\n\\[\n14 \\times 5 = 70\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many students have 3 notebooks each. Since the other half of the 28 students have 3 notebooks each, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{28}{2} = 14\n\\]\nSo, 14 students have 3 notebooks each. Therefore, the total number of notebooks these 14 students have is:\n\\[\n14 \\times 3 = 42\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of notebooks from both groups to find the total number of notebooks in the classroom:\n\\[\n70 + 42 = 112\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of notebooks in the classroom is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{112}\n\\]",

Since half of the 28 students have 5 notebooks each, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{28}{2} = 14\n\\]\nSo, there are 14 students who have 5 notebooks each. Therefore, the total number of notebooks these students have is:\n\\[\n14 \\times 5 = 70\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of students who have 3 notebooks each. Since the other half of the 28 students have 3 notebooks each, we again perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{28}{2} = 14\n\\]\nSo, there are 14 students who have 3 notebooks each. Therefore, the total number of notebooks these students have is:\n\\[\n14 \\times 3 = 42\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of notebooks from both groups to find the total number of notebooks in the classroom:\n\\[\n70 + 42 = 112\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of notebooks in the classroom is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{112}\n\\]",
