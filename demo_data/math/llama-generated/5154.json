At the farmers' market he buys 5 pounds of eggplants and 4 pounds of zucchini at $2.00 a pound.  He needs 4 pounds of tomatoes that are $3.50 a pound.  The onions are $1.00 a pound and he needs 3 pounds.  Then he needs a pound of basil which is sold for $2.50 per half pound.  If this yields 4 quarts, how much does each quart cost?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
