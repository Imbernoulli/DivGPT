        "To determine how much money Mr. Mathews makes from the sale of the animals, we start by finding the number of goats and sheep on his farm. The ratio of goats to sheep is 5:7, and the total number of animals is 360. Let the number of goats be \\(5x\\) and the number of sheep be \\(7x\\). According to the problem, we have:\n\n\\[5x + 7x = 360\\]\n\\[12x = 360\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{360}{12} = 30\\]\n\nSo, the number of goats is \\(5x = 5 \\times 30 = 150\\) and the number of sheep is \\(7x = 7 \\times 30 = 210\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the number of goats and sheep that Mr. Mathews sells. He sells half of the goats:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\times 150 = 75\\]\n\nAnd he sells \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the sheep:\n\n\\[\\frac{2}{3} \\times 210 = 140\\]\n\nThe revenue from selling the goats is:\n\n\\[75 \\times 40 = 3000\\]\n\nThe revenue from selling the sheep is:\n\n\\[140 \\times 30 = 4200\\]\n\nAdding these two amounts gives the total revenue from the sale of the animals:\n\n\\[3000 + 4200 = 7200\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Mr. Mathews makes from the sale of the animals is \\(\\boxed{7200}\\).",

According to the ratio, we have:\n\\[ G = 5x \\]\n\\[ S = 7x \\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is a common multiplier. The total number of animals is given by:\n\\[ G + S = 360 \\]\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( G \\) and \\( S \\) in terms of \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[ 5x + 7x = 360 \\]\n\\[ 12x = 360 \\]\n\\[ x = 30 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the number of goats and sheep:\n\\[ G = 5x = 5 \\times 30 = 150 \\]\n\\[ S = 7x = 7 \\times 30 = 210 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of goats and sheep that Mr. Mathews sells. He sells half of the goats:\n\\[ \\text{Number of goats sold} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 150 = 75 \\]\n He sells \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the sheep:\n\\[ \\text{Number of sheep sold} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 210 = 140 \\]\n\nThe revenue from selling the goats is:\n\\[ \\text{Revenue from goats} = 75 \\times 40 = 3000 \\]\nThe revenue from selling the sheep is:\n\\[ \\text{Revenue from sheep} = 140 \\times 30 = 4200 \\]\n\nThe total revenue from the sale of the animals is:\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = 3000 + 4200 = 7200 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Mr. Mathews makes from the sale of the animals is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7200} \\]"
