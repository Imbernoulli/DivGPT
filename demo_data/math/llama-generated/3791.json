        "To determine Sophia's age three years from now, we start by defining the current ages of Jeremy, Sebastian, and Sophia. Let's denote Jeremy's current age as \\( J \\), Sebastian's current age as \\( S \\), and Sophia's current age as \\( P \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following:\n1. Jeremy's current age is 40, so \\( J = 40 \\).\n2. Sebastian is 4 years older than Jeremy, so \\( S = J + 4 \\). Substituting \\( J = 40 \\) into this equation gives \\( S = 40 + 4 = 44 \\).\n3. The sum of their ages in three years is 150. In three years, Jeremy's age will be \\( J + 3 \\), Sebastian's age will be \\( S + 3 \\), and Sophia's age will be \\( P + 3 \\). Therefore, the equation for the sum of their ages in three years is:\n   \\[\n   (J + 3) + (S + 3) + (P + 3) = 150\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   J + S + P + 9 = 150\n   \\]\n   Subtracting 9 from both sides, we find:\n   \\[\n   J + S + P = 141\n   \\]\n   We already know \\( J = 40 \\) and \\( S = 44 \\), so substituting these values into the equation gives:\n   \\[\n   40 + 44 + P = 141\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   84 + P = 141\n   \\]\n   Subtracting 84 from both sides, we find:\n   \\[\n   P = 57\n   \\]\n   So, Sophia's current age is 57. To find Sophia's age three years from now, we add 3 to her current age:\n   \\[\n   P + 3 = 57 + 3 = 60\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Sophia's age three years from now is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",

Jeremy's current age \\( J \\) is 40.\n2. Sebastian is 4 years older than Jeremy, so \\( S = J + 4 \\).\n3. The sum of their ages in three years is 150.\n\nFirst, we substitute Jeremy's current age into the equation for Sebastian's current age:\n\\[ S = 40 + 4 = 44 \\]\n\nNext, we express the ages of Jeremy, Sebastian, and Sophia in three years:\n- Jeremy's age in three years will be \\( J + 3 = 40 + 3 = 43 \\).\n- Sebastian's age in three years will be \\( S + 3 = 44 + 3 = 47 \\).\n- Sophia's age in three years will be \\( P + 3 \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the sum of their ages in three years is 150:\n\\[ 43 + 47 + (P + 3) = 150 \\]\n\nWe simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 43 + 47 + P + 3 = 93 + P \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\\[ 93 + P = 150 \\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), we subtract 93 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ P = 150 - 93 = 57 \\]\n\nSophia's current age is 57.
