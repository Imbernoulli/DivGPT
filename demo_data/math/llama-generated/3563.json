        "To determine how much money Samantha would have saved by paying cash, we need to calculate the total amount she paid in installments and then compare it to the cash price of the refrigerator.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount paid in installments. Samantha paid a deposit of $3000 and then 30 equal monthly installments of $300 each. The total amount paid in installments is given by:\n\\[\n3000 + 30 \\times 300\n\\]\nCalculating the multiplication first, we get:\n\\[\n30 \\times 300 = 9000\n\\]\nAdding the deposit to this amount, we get:\n\\[\n3000 + 9000 = 12000\n\\]\nSo, the total amount Samantha paid in installments is $12000.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much more Samantha paid compared to the cash price of the refrigerator. The cash price of the refrigerator is $8000. The difference between the total amount paid in installments and the cash price is:\n\\[\n12000 - 8000 = 4000\n\\]\nTherefore, Samantha would have saved \\(\\boxed{4000}\\) dollars by paying cash.",
