        "To determine how much Judy will spend on pencils over 45 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of pencils Judy uses per day:**\n   Judy uses 10 pencils in 5 days. Therefore, the number of pencils she uses per day is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10 \\text{ pencils}}{5 \\text{ days}} = 2 \\text{ pencils per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of pencils Judy uses in 45 days:**\n   Since she uses 2 pencils per day, over 45 days she will use:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ pencils per day} \\times 45 \\text{ days} = 90 \\text{ pencils}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how many 30 packs of pencils Judy needs:**\n   Each pack contains 30 pencils. To find out how many packs are needed for 90 pencils, we divide:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{90 \\text{ pencils}}{30 \\text{ pencils per pack}} = 3 \\text{ packs}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the total cost of the pencils:**\n   Each pack costs $4. Therefore, the total cost for 3 packs is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ packs} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars per pack} = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Judy will spend \\(\\boxed{12}\\) dollars on pencils over 45 days.",
