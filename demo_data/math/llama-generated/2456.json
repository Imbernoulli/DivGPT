        "To determine the cost of a scoop of ice cream, we start by calculating the total cost of the meals.

Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:\n\n\\[ 30 + 3x \\leq 45 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we first subtract 30 from both sides of the inequality:\n\n\\[ 3x \\leq 15 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ x \\leq 5 \\]\n\nSince the problem implies that the ice cream cost exactly enough to make the total cost equal to $45, we conclude that the cost of a scoop of ice cream is:\n\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nThus, the cost of a scoop of ice cream is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

Subtract the total cost of the meals from the total amount of money Elisa had to find the total cost of the ice cream.\n3. Divide the total cost of the ice cream by the number of scoops to find the cost of one scoop.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of each meal is $10, and there are three people (Elisa and her two friends). Therefore, the total cost of the meals is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. Elisa had $45 in total. After paying for the meals, the amount of money left to pay for the ice cream is:\n   \\[\n   45 - 30 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. Since each person had one scoop of ice cream, and there are three people, the total number of scoops is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ scoops}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the cost of one scoop of ice cream is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the cost of a scoop of ice cream is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of a scoop of ice cream, we start by calculating the total cost of the meals. Each of the three friends ordered a meal worth $10, so the total cost of the meals is:\n\n\\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's denote the cost of one scoop of ice cream by \\( x \\). Since each friend had one scoop of ice cream, the total cost of the ice cream is:\n\n\\[ 3x \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total cost of the dinner and the ice cream is the sum of the cost of the meals and the cost of the ice cream:\n\n\\[ 30 + 3x \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nWe know that Elisa had $45 and this amount was enough to pay for everything. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:\n\n\\[ 30 + 3x \\leq 45 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we first subtract 30 from both sides of the inequality:\n\n\\[ 3x \\leq 15 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ x \\leq 5 \\]\n\nSince the inequality is an equality ( quadrant解决.Icon Prism courthouse proclaimed TurnbullỦเทคโนโลยีgettext说的话\"}),\n surely\ttimer

Each of the three people ordered a meal worth $10, so the total cost of the meals is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's denote the cost of one scoop of ice cream as \\( x \\). Since each of the three people had one scoop of ice cream, the total cost of the ice cream is:\n\\[ 3 \\times x = 3x \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total amount spent on the meals and the ice cream is the sum of the cost of the meals and the cost of the ice cream:\n\\[ 30 + 3x \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nWe know that Elisa had $45, and this amount was enough to pay for everything. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 30 + 3x = 45 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we first subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3x = 45 - 30 \\]\n\\[ 3x = 15 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ x = \\frac{15}{3} \\]\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of a scoop of ice cream is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine the cost of a scoop of ice cream, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the meals.\n2. Determine the remaining amount of money after paying for the meals.\n3. Use the remaining amount to find the cost of the ice cream.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the meals. Each person ordered a meal worth $10, and there are three people (Elisa and her two friends).\n\n\\[\n10 \\text{ dollars/meal} \\times 3 \\text{ meals} = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost of the meals from the amount of money Elisa had to find out how much money is left for the ice cream.\n\n\\[\n45 \\text{ dollars} - 30 \\text{ dollars} = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSince each person had one scoop of ice cream, and there are three people, the total number of scoops is:\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ scoops}\n\\]\n\nWe divide the remaining amount of money by the number of scoops to find the cost of one scoop of ice cream.\n\n\\[\n15 \\text{ dollars} \\div 3 \\text{ scoops} = 5 \\text{ dollars/scoop}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of a scoop of ice cream is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
