        "To determine how much John spent on his phone, we first need to calculate the additional cost John incurred compared to Alan. Alan bought the phone for $2000, and John bought it 2% more expensive. We can find the additional cost by calculating 2% of $2000.\n\nFirst, we calculate 2% of $2000:\n\\[\n2\\% \\text{ of } 2000 = \\frac{2}{100} \\times 2000 = 0.02 \\times 2000 = 40\n\\]\nSo, John spent an additional $40 on his phone. To find the total amount John spent, we add this additional cost to the original price of the phone:\n\\[\n2000 + 40 = 2040\n\\]\nTherefore, John spent \\(\\boxed{2040}\\) dollars on his phone.",
