        "To determine how many plumeria flowers Jaynie needs to pick to make 4 leis, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of plumeria flowers needed for one lei:**\n   Jaynie needs 2 and a half dozen plumeria flowers for one lei. Since one dozen equals 12 flowers, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   2.5 \\text{ dozen} = 2.5 \\times 12 = 30 \\text{ flowers}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of plumeria flowers needed for 4 leis:**\n   Since each lei requires 30 flowers, for 4 leis, we multiply the number of flowers per lei by the number of leis:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ flowers/lei} \\times 4 \\text{ leis} = 120 \\text{ flowers}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jaynie must pick \\boxed{120} plumeria flowers from the trees in her yard.",
