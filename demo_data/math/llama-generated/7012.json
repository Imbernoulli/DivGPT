Let \\( M \\) represent the number of macarons Miles made.\n   \\[\n   26 = \\frac{M}{2}\n   \\]\n   To find \\( M \\), multiply both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   M = 26 \\times 2 = 52\n   \\]\n   So, Miles made 52 macarons.\n\n4. **Renz's Macarons:**\n   Renz made 1 fewer than \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) as many macarons as Miles.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\times 52 = \\frac{3 \\times 52}{4} = \\frac{156}{4} = 39\n   \\]\n   Renz made 39 macarons.\n   \\[\n   39 - 1 = 38\n   \\]\n   So, Renz made 38 macarons.\n\n5. **Total Macarons:**\n   Combine the macarons made by Mitch, Joshua, Miles, and Renz.\n   \\[\n   20 + 26 + 52 + 38 = 136\n   \\]\n\n6. **Number of Kids Receiving Macarons:**\n   Each kid receives 2 macarons.
