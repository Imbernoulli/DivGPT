        "To determine how many cans of chickpeas Thomas should buy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of chickpeas needed for 20 servings:**\n   - Each serving requires 1 cup of chickpeas.\n   - Therefore, for 20 servings, Thomas needs:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ servings} \\times 1 \\text{ cup per serving} = 20 \\text{ cups of chickpeas}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the total amount of chickpeas from cups to ounces:**\n   - We know that 1 cup of chickpeas weighs 6 ounces.\n   - Therefore, 20 cups of chickpeas weigh:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ cups} \\times 6 \\text{ ounces per cup} = 120 \\text{ ounces}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many cans of chickpeas are needed:**\n   - Each can contains 16 ounces of chickpeas.\n   - To find out how many cans are required, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per can:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{120 \\text{ ounces}}{16 \\text{ ounces per can}} = 7.5 \\text{ cans}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Since Thomas cannot buy half a can, he needs to round up to the next whole number:**\n   - Therefore, Thomas needs to buy 8 cans of chickpeas.\n\nThus, the number of cans of chickpeas Thomas should buy is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

        "To determine how many cans of chickpeas Thomas should buy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of chickpeas needed for 20 servings:**\n   - Each serving requires 1 cup of chickpeas.\n   - For 20 servings, the total amount of chickpeas needed is:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ servings} \\times 1 \\text{ cup/serving} = 20 \\text{ cups}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert cups to ounces:**\n   - We know that 1 cup of chickpeas weighs 6 ounces.\n   - Therefore, 20 cups of chickpeas weigh:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ cups} \\times 6 \\text{ ounces/cup} = 120 \\text{ ounces}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many cans are needed:**\n   - Each can contains 16 ounces of chickpeas.\n   - To find out how many cans are required, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per can:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{120 \\text{ ounces}}{16 \\text{ ounces/can}} = 7.5 \\text{ cans}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Since Thomas cannot buy a fraction of a can, round up to the next whole number:**\n   - Therefore, Thomas should buy 8 cans of chickpeas.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many cans of chickpeas Thomas should buy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of chickpeas needed for 20 servings.\n2. Convert the total amount of chickpeas from cups to ounces.\n3. Determine how many cans of chickpeas are required based on the反之 HttpStatusCode of chickpeas per can.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of chickpeas needed for 20 servings.**\n\nThe recipe calls for 1 cup of chickpeas per serving. Therefore, for 20 servings, the total amount of chickpeas needed is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ servings} \\times 1 \\text{ cup/serving} = 20 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Convert the total amount of chickpeas from cups to ounces.**\n\nWe know that there are 6 ounces in 1 cup of chickpeas. Therefore, the total amount of chickpeas in ounces is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ cups} \\times 6 \\text{ ounces/cup} = 120 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many cans of chickpeas are required based on the weight of chickpeas per can.**\n\nEach can of chickpeas contains 16 ounces. Therefore, the number of cans needed is:\n\\[ \\frac{120 \\text{ ounces}}{16 \\text{ ounces/can}} = 7.5 \\text{ cans} \\]\n\nSince Thomas cannot buy half a can, he needs to round up to the next whole number.
