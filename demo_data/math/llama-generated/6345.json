        "To determine how many TVs Beatrice looked at on the auction site, we start by calculating the number of TVs she looked at at each store.\n\nFirst, we know that Beatrice looked at 8 TVs at one store.\n\nNext, she looked at three times as many TVs at an online store. So, we calculate:\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\nThis means she looked at 24 TVs at the online store.\n\nLet's denote the number of TVs she looked at on the auction site as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of TVs she looked at is 42. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of TVs:\n\\[ 8 + 24 + x = 42 \\]\n\nNow, we combine the known quantities:\n\\[ 32 + x = 42 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 32 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 42 - 32 \\]\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nSo, the number of TVs Beatrice looked at on the auction site is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

Solve the equation for the variable.\n\nFirst, we know that Beatrice looked at 8 TVs at the store in person. At the online store, she looked at three times as many TVs as she did at the store in person. Therefore, the number of TVs she looked at at the online store is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nLet the number of TVs she looked at on the auction site be \\( x \\). According to the problem, the total number of TVs she looked at is 42. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 8 + 24 + x = 42 \\]\n\nNext, we combine the known quantities on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 32 + x = 42 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we subtract 32 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 42 - 32 \\]\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of TVs Beatrice looked at on the auction site is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."
