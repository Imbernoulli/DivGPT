        "To determine the circumference of Bill's head, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the circumference of Charlie's head:**\n   - Jack's head circumference is 12 inches.\n   - Charlie's head circumference is 9 inches more than half of Jack's head circumference.\n   - First, calculate half of Jack's head circumference:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n   - Add 9 inches to this value to get Charlie's head circumference:\n     \\[\n     6 + 9 = 15 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the circumference of Bill's head:**\n   - Bill's head circumference is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of Charlie's head circumference.\n   - Calculate \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of 15 inches:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{3} \\times 15 = 10 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the circumference of Bill's head is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) inches.",
        "To determine the circumference of Bill's head, we need to follow the steps to find the circumferences of Charlie's and Bill's heads based on the given information.\n\nFirst, we know the circumference of Jack's head is 12 inches. We can use this information to find the circumference of Charlie's head. According to the problem, Charlie's head is 9 inches more than half the circumference of Jack's head. We can express this mathematically as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{ Circumference of Charlie's head} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Circumference of Jack's head} + 9\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the value of Jack's head circumference:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Circumference of Charlie's head} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 + 9 = 6 + 9 = 15 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the circumference of Bill's head. The problem states that Bill's head is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) the circumference of Charlie's head. We can express this mathematically as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Circumference of Bill's head} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\text{Circumference of Charlie's head}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the value of Charlie's head circumference:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Circumference of Bill's head} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 15 = 10 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the circumference of Bill's head is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) inches.",

Use the circumference of Charlie's head to find the circumference of Bill's head.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the circumference of Charlie's head. We know that Charlie's head is 9 inches more than half the circumference of Jack's head. Jack's head has a circumference of 12 inches. So, half of Jack's head circumference is:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\nAdding 9 inches to this value gives us Charlie's head circumference:\n\\[\n6 + 9 = 15 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the circumference of Bill's head.
