In six years, Ellen will be:\n\\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Martha is twice as old as Ellen will be in six years. Therefore, Martha's current age can be expressed as:\n\\[ 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nThus, Martha's current age is:\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]",
        "To determine Martha's age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Ellen's age in six years.\n2. Determine Martha's age based on the relationship given in the problem.\n\nFirst, we know Ellen's current age is 10 years. In six years, Ellen's age will be:\n\\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Martha is twice as old as Ellen will be in six years. Therefore, Martha's age now is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nSo, Martha's age now is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
        "To determine Martha's current age, we start by analyzing the information given:\n\n1. Ellen is currently 10 years old.\n2. Martha realized she was twice as old as Ellen will be in six years.\n\nFirst, we calculate Ellen's age in six years:\n\\[\n10 + 6 = 16\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Martha was twice as old as Ellen will be in six years. Therefore, we multiply Ellen's age in six years by 2:\n\\[\n2 \\times 16 = 32\n\\]\n\nThis calculation tells us that Martha was 32 years old when she met Ellen. Since the problem does not specify any time difference between their meeting and the current不容, we conclude that Martha's current age is不出 Edgar toastedช้าง returnUrl CORE forces煊坚果_geom beaut

Therefore, Martha's age is:\n\n\\[2 \\times 16 = 32 \\text{ years old}\\]\n\nThus, Martha's age now is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
        "To determine Martha's age, we start by identifying Ellen's age in six years.

        "To determine Martha's age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Ellen's age in six years.\n2. Use the information that Martha's current age is twice Ellen's age in six years to find Martha's age.\n\nFirst, let's find Ellen's age in six years. Ellen is currently 10 years old, so in six years she will be:\n\\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Martha's current age is twice Ellen's age in six years. Therefore, Martha's current age is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nSo, Martha's age now is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
        "To determine Martha's age, we start by defining the current age of Ellen and using the information given in the problem.\n\n1. Ellen's current age is 10 years.\n2. In six years, Ellen's age will be \\(10 + 6 = 16\\) years.\n3. According to the problem, Martha is currently twice as old as Ellen will be in six years.
