        "To determine the total number of fish-eater birds Cohen saw over the three days, we need to calculate the number of birds present each day and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **First Day:**\n   Cohen saw 300 fish-eater birds.\n\n2. **Second Day:**\n   The number of birds doubled. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   300 \\times 2 = 600\n   \\]\n   So, Cohen saw 600 fish-eater birds on the second day.\n\n3. **Third Day:**\n   The number of birds reduced by 200. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   600 - 200 = 400\n   \\]\n   So, Cohen saw 400 fish-eater birds on the third day.\n\n4. **Total Number of Birds Over Three Days:**\n   We sum the number of birds seen each day:\n   \\[\n   300 + 600 + 400 = 1300\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of fish-eater birds Cohen saw in the three days is \\(\\boxed{1300}\\).",
