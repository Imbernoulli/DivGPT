According to the problem, twice as many pinecones are eaten by squirrels as by reindeer. Therefore, the number of pinecones eaten by squirrels is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 400 = 800 \\]\n\nSo, 800 pinecones are eaten by squirrels.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of pinecones remaining after the reindeer and squirrels have eaten. We subtract the pinecones eaten by reindeer and squirrels from the initial number of pinecones:\n\n\\[ 2000 - 400 - 800 = 800 \\]\n\nSo, there are 800 pinecones remaining.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pinecones are collected to make fires. According to the problem, 25% of the remaining pinecones are collected. Therefore, the number of pinecones collected to make fires is:\n\n\\[ 800 \\times 0.25 = 200 \\]\n\nSo, 200 pinecones are collected to make fires.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the number of pinecones left after some are collected to make fires. We subtract the pinecones collected to make fires from the remaining pinecones:\n\n\\[ 800 - 200 = 600 \\]\n\nSo, the number of pinecones left is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]",
