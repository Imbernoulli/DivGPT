When she went to put them away, she discovered that she already had 5 boxes in the pantry. Her parrot eats 100 grams of seeds each week and her cockatiel eats 50 grams of seeds in a week. If each box of birdseed contains 225 grams, for how many weeks can she feed her birds without going back to the store?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "First, we need to determine the total number of boxes of birdseed Leah has. She bought 3 boxes and already had 5 boxes in the pantry. Therefore, the total number of boxes is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of birdseed in these 8 boxes. Since each box contains 225 grams, the total amount of birdseed is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 225 = 1800 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much birdseed Leah's birds consume each week. Her parrot eats 100 grams each week and her cockatiel eats 50 grams each week. Therefore, the total weekly consumption of birdseed is:\n\\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\nTo determine how many weeks Leah can feed her birds without going back to the store, we divide the total amount of birdseed by the weekly consumption:\n\\[ \\frac{1800}{150} = 12 \\]\n\nThus, Leah can feed her birds for \\(\\boxed{12}\\) weeks without going back to the store.",
