        "To determine how many more bottles of water the camp organizer still needs to buy, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of workers (children and adults) in the camp:**\n   - The first group has 14 children.\n   - The second group has 16 children.\n   - The third group has 12 children.\n   - The fourth group has half of the number of the first three groups combined.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of children in the fourth group} = \\frac{14 + 16 + 12}{2} = \\frac{42}{2} = 21\n     \\]\n   - Assuming there are no adults, the total number of workers is:\n     \\[\n     14 + 16 + 12 + 21 = 63\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of bottles苹果 consumed by all workers in 3 days:**\n   - Each worker consumes 3 bottles per day.\n   - For 3 days, the total consumption per worker is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ bottles/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 9 \\text{ bottles/worker}\n     \\]\n   - For 63 workers, the total consumption is:\n     \\[\n     63 \\text{ workers} \\times 9 \\text{ bottles/worker} = 567 \\text{ bottles}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of bottles of water currently purchased:**\n   - Each case contains 24 bottles.\n   - The camp purchased 13 cases.\n   - The total number of bottles purchased is:\n     \\[\n     13 \\text{ cases} \\times 24 \\text{ bottles/case} = 312 \\text{ bottles}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many more bottles of water are needed:**\n   - Subtract the number of bottles purchased from the total number of bottles required:\n     \\[\n     567 \\text{ bottles} - 312 \\text{ bottles} = 255 \\text{ bottles}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the camp organizer still needs to buy \\(\\boxed{255}\\) more bottles of water.",
