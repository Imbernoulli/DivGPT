Calculate the number of cans in one closet.\n   - Jack can fit 10 shelves in one closet.\n   - Since each shelf holds 48 cans, the number of cans in one closet is \\(48 \\times 10 = 480\\).\n\nSo, the total number of cans Jack can store in each closet is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",
        "To determine how many cans Jack can store in each closet, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps and then multiply the numbers together.\n\n1. First, we find out how many cans can fit in one shelf.
