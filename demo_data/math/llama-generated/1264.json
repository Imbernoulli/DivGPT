        "To determine the total number of toys that Annie, Mike, and Tom have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of toys Annie has:**\n   - Mike has 6 toys.\n   - Annie has three times more toys than Mike.\n   - Therefore, the number of toys Annie has is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 6 + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of toys Tom has:**\n   - Annie has two less toys than Tom.\n   - Let \\( T \\) represent the number of toys Tom has. According to the problem:\n     \\[\n     24 = T - 2\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( T \\):\n     \\[\n     T = 24 + 2 = 26\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of toys:**\n   - Mike has 6 toys.\n   - Annie has 24 toys.\n   - Tom has 26 toys.\n   - Adding these together gives:\n     \\[\n     6 + 24 + 26 = 56\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of toys that Annie, Mike, and Tom have is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",
