        "To determine how many sheep are out in the wilderness, we start by finding out the total number of sheep Carla originally had. We know that 90% of the sheep were rounded up, and this number is 81. Let's denote the total number of sheep by \\( x \\). According to the problem, 90% of \\( x \\) is equal to 81. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\n\\[ 0.9x = 81 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.9:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{81}{0.9} = 90 \\]\n\nSo, Carla originally had 90 sheep. Since 10% of the sheep wandered off into the hills, we need to calculate 10% of 90 to find out how many sheep are out in the wilderness. We do this by multiplying 90 by 0.1:\n\n\\[ 0.1 \\times 90 = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of sheep out in the wilderness is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
