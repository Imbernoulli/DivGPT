Since there are 12 months in a year, the hunting season lasts:\n\\[ 12 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 3 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nJack goes hunting 6 times a month, so in 3 months he goes hunting:\n\\[ 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\text{ times} \\]\n\nEach time he goes hunting, he catches 2 deer. Therefore, in 18 times he catches:\n\\[ 18 \\times 2 = 36 \\text{ deer} \\]\n\nEach deer weighs 600 pounds, so the total weight of the deer he catches is:\n\\[ 36 \\times 600 = 21600 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nJack keeps half the weight of the deer he catches, so the weight of the deer he keeps is:\n\\[ 21600 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 10800 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of deer Jack keeps in pounds is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10800} \\]",
        "To determine how much deer Jack keeps in pounds, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of times Jack goes hunting in a quarter of the year.\n2. Determine the total number of deer Jack catches in a quarter of the year.\n3. Calculate the total weight of the deer Jack catches in a quarter of the year.\n4. Find out how much weight of deer Jack keeps.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of times Jack goes hunting in a quarter of the year.**\n\nJack goes hunting 6 times a month, and the hunting season lasts for 1 quarter of the year, which is 3 months. Therefore, the total number of times Jack goes hunting in a quarter of the year is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ times/month} \\times 3 \\text{ months} = 18 \\text{ times} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of deer Jack catches in a quarter of the year.**\n\nJack catches 2 deer each time he goes hunting. Therefore, the total number of deer Jack catches in a quarter of the year is:\n\\[ 18 \\text{ times} \\times 2 \\text{ deer/time} = 36 \\text{ deer} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the deer Jack catches in a quarter of the year.**\n\nEach deer weighs 600 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the deer Jack catches in a quarter of the year is:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ deer} \\times 600 \\text{ pounds/deer} = 21600 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find out how much weight of deer Jack keeps.**\n\nJack keeps half the weight of the deer he catches. Therefore, the weight of the deer Jack keeps is:\n\\[ \\frac{21600 \\text{ pounds}}{2} = 10800 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10800} \\]",
