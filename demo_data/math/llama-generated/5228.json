This store contains 20 units of phones but the owner found out that there were 5 defective units. After he got rid of the defective units, he started to sell the rest of his units to customer A who bought 3 units, customer B who bought a certain amount of units, and customer C who bought 7 units. In the end, all non-defective units were sold. How many units were sold to Customer B?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many units were sold to Customer B, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of non-defective units.\n2. Subtract the number of units sold to customers A and C from the total number of non-defective units.\n\nFirst, we start with the total number of units in the store, which is 20. Since there are 5 defective units, the number of non-defective units is:\n\\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \\]\n\nNext, we know that customer A bought 3 units and customer C bought 7 units. Let's denote the number of units bought by customer B as \\( x \\). Since all non-defective units were sold, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 3 + x + 7 = 15 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 10 + x = 15 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 15 - 10 \\]\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of units sold to Customer B is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

Customer A bought 3 units, Customer C bought 7 units, and we need to find out how many units Customer B bought. Let's denote the number of units bought by Customer B as \\( x \\). Since all non-defective units were sold, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 3 + x + 7 = 15 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 10 + x = 15 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ x = 15 - 10 \\]\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of units sold to Customer B is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
