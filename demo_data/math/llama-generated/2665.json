        "To determine how many more liters of soda Julio has compared to Mateo, we first need to calculate the total amount of soda each of them has.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of soda Julio has. Julio has four bottles of orange soda and seven bottles of grape soda. Since each bottle contains 2 liters of soda, we can calculate the total amount of soda Julio has as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total soda Julio has} = (4 \\text{ bottles of orange soda} + 7 \\text{ bottles of grape soda}) \\times 2 \\text{ liters per bottle}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total soda Julio has} = 11 \\text{ bottles} \\times 2 \\text{ liters per bottle} = 22 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of soda Mateo has. Mateo has one bottle of orange soda and three bottles of grape soda. Since each bottle contains 2 liters of soda, we can calculate the total amount of soda Mateo has as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total soda Mateo has} = (1 \\text{ bottle of orange soda} + 3 \\text{ bottles of grape soda}) \\times 2 \\text{ liters per bottle}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total soda Mateo has} = 4 \\text{ bottles} \\times 2 \\text{ liters per bottle} = 8 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more liters of soda Julio has compared to Mateo. We do this by subtracting the total amount of soda Mateo has from the total amount of soda Julio has:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in soda} = 22 \\text{ liters} - 8 \\text{ liters} = 14 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Julio has \\(\\boxed{14}\\) more liters of soda than Mateo.",

Since each bottle contains 2 liters, we multiply the number of bottles by 2.\n\nFor Julio:\n\\[ 11 \\text{ bottles} \\times 2 \\text{ liters per bottle} = 22 \\text{ liters} \\]\nSo, Julio has 22 liters of soda.\n\nFor Mateo:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ bottles} \\times 2 \\text{ liters per bottle} = 8 \\text{ liters} \\]\nSo, Mateo has 8 liters of soda.\n\nFinally, we find the difference in the total volume of soda between Julio and Mateo:\n\\[ 22 \\text{ liters} - 8 \\text{ liters} = 14 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nTherefore, Julio has \\(\\boxed{14}\\) more liters of soda than Mateo.",

Since each bottle contains 2 liters, we can find the total amount of soda by multiplying the number of bottles by the amount of beverage per bottle.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total soda Julio has} = (4 \\text{ bottles of orange soda} + 7 \\text{ bottles of grape soda}) \\times 2 \\text{ liters per bottle}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total soda Julio has} = 11 \\text{ bottles} \\times 2 \\text{ liters per bottle} = 22 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of soda Mateo has. Mateo has 1 bottle of orange soda and 3 bottles of grape soda. Similarly, we multiply the number of bottles by the amount of beverage per bottle.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total soda Mateo has} = (1 \\text{ bottle of orange soda} + 3 \\text{ bottles of grape soda}) \\times 2 \\text{ liters per bottle}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total soda Mateo has} = 4 \\text{ bottles} \\times 2 \\text{ liters per bottle} = 8 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the total amounts of soda Julio and Mateo have.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Total soda Julio has} - \\text{Total soda Mateo has}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 22 \\text{ liters} - 8 \\text{ liters} = 14 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Julio has \\(\\boxed{14}\\) more liters of soda than Mateo.",
