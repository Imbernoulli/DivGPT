        "To determine the number of students who don't eat lunch, we start by defining the variables and using the given information to set up equations.\n\n1. Let \\( C \\) represent the number of students who eat in the school cafeteria.\n2. Let \\( L \\) represent the number of students who bring their lunch.\n3. Let \\( N \\) represent the number of students who don't eat lunch.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- The total number of students in the class is 60.\n- The number of students who bring their lunch is three times the number of students who eat in the school cafeteria.\n- The number of students who eat in the school cafeteria is 10.\n\nFirst, we substitute the given value of \\( C \\) into the equation for \\( L \\):\n\\[\nL = 3C\n\\]\n\\[\nL = 3 \\times 10 = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the total number of students to set up an equation that includes \\( C \\), \\( L \\), and \\( N \\):\n\\[\nC + L + N = 60\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the values of \\( C \\) and \\( L \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n10 + 30 + N = 60\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation to solve for \\( N \\):\n\\[\n40 + N = 60\n\\]\n\\[\nN = 60 - 40\n\\]\n\\[\nN = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students who don't eat lunch is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."
