        "To determine how much John makes per day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate John's monthly earnings:**\n   John earns $0.01 per visit. Given that he gets 30,000 visits a month, we can calculate his total monthly earnings by multiplying the number of visits by the earnings per visit:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly earnings} = 30,000 \\text{ visits} \\times 0.01 \\text{ dollars/visit}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly earnings} = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine John's daily earnings:**\n   John runs the website for a normal 30-day month. To find out how much he makes per day, we divide his total monthly earnings by the number of days in the month:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily earnings} = \\frac{300 \\text{ dollars}}{30 \\text{ days}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily earnings} = 10 \\text{ dollars/day}\n   \\]\n\nThus, John makes \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars per day.",
