        "To determine how many games the Tigers won, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of home games, which is given as 56.\n2. Identify the number of losses, which is given as 12.\n3. Identify the number of ties. According to the problem, the number of ties is half as many as the number of losses. Therefore, the number of ties is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n4. Calculate the number of wins. The total number of games is the sum of wins, losses, and ties. Let \\( W \\) be the number of wins. Then we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   W + 12 + 6 = 56\n   \\]\n5. Simplify the equation to solve for \\( W \\):\n   \\[\n   W + 18 = 56\n   \\]\n   Subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   W = 56 - 18\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   W = 38\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of games the Tigers won is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",

Calculate the number of wins by subtracting the number of losses and ties from the total number of games.\n\nLet's start with the total number of home games played, which is 56.\n\nNext, we know the number of losses is 12.\n\nThe number of ties is half as many as the number of losses. Therefore, we calculate the number of ties as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ties} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the number of wins by subtracting the number of losses and ties from the total number of games:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of wins} = 56 - 12 - 6 = 38\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of games the Tigers won is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",
        "To determine the number of games the Tigers won, we start by identifying the number of losses and ties they had.\n\nFirst, we know the Tigers had 12 losses.

Therefore, we calculate the number of ties as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ties} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many games they won. The total number of home games is the sum of the wins, losses, and ties.
