She found 32 mushrooms and used her guidebook to identify which ones were poisonous and which were safe to eat. In the end, she had 9 mushrooms she could safely eat for dinner. Of the rest, she identified twice the amount she ate as poisonous, and a remaining bunch she was uncertain about.

Therefore, the number of mushrooms that are either poisonous or uncertain is:\n\n\\[ 32 - 9 = 23 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Lillian identified twice the number of mushrooms she ate as poisonous. Since she ate 9 mushrooms, the number of poisonous mushrooms is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 9 = 18 \\]\n\nThis means that the number of mushrooms she was uncertain about is the total number of mushrooms that are either poisonous or uncertain minus the number of poisonous mushrooms:\n\n\\[ 23 - 18 = 5 \\]\n\nThus, the number of mushrooms Lillian was uncertain about is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]",
