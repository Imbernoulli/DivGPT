        "To determine how many stamps Marie can give away, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of stamps Marie has.\n2. Determine how many stamps she decides to keep.\n3.

        "First, we need to determine the total number of stamps Marie has. She has 4 notebooks with 20 stamps each and 2 binders with 50 stamps each.
