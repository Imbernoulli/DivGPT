Since Max was born on the same day Luka turned 4 years old, Max's age when Luka is 10 years old is:\n\\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nSo, on Aubrey's 8th birthday, Jordan's dog, Max, was \\(\\boxed{6}\\) years old.",
        "To determine how old Jordan's dog, Max, was on Aubrey's 8th birthday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Luka's age when Aubrey was born:**\n   - Luka is exactly 2 years older than Aubrey. Therefore, when Aubrey was born, Luka was 2 years old.\n\n2. **Determine Luka's age when Aubrey was 8:**\n   - Aubrey is currently 8 years old. Since Luka is 2 years older than Aubrey, we add 2 years to Aubrey's age:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Luka's age} = 8 + 2 = 10\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine Max's age when Aubrey was 8:**\n   - Max was born on the same day that Luka turned 4 years old. When Aubrey is 8 years old, Luka is 10 years old. The difference in age between Luka and Max is 4 years (since Max was born when Luka was 4). Therefore, Max is 10 - 4 years old:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Max's age} = 10 - 4 = 6\n     \\]\n\nThus, on Aubrey's 8th birthday, Jordan's dog, Max, was \\(\\boxed{6}\\) years old.",
