        "To determine Matt's age 10 years from now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Bush's current age.\n2. Determine Matt's current age based on the age difference between them.\n3. Calculate Matt's age 10 years from now.\n\nFirst, we know that Bush is currently 12 years old. Since Bush is younger than Matt by 3 years, we can find Matt's current age by adding 3 years to Bush's age:\n\\[\n\\text{Matt's current age} = \\text{Bush's current age} + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how old Matt will be 10 years from now.
