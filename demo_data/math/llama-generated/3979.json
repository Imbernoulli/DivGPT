But Luna's master, Mary, and her husband, Frank, sometimes feed Luna too much kibble.  One day, starting with a new, 12-cup bag of kibble, Mary gave Luna 1 cup of kibble in the morning and 1 cup of kibble in the evening, But on the same day, Frank also gave Luna 1 cup of kibble in the afternoon and twice as much in the late evening as he had given Luna in the afternoon.  The next morning, how many cups of kibble will Mary find remaining in the bag?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many cups of kibble remain in the bag after Frank and Mary have fed Luna, we need to calculate the total amount of kibble given to Luna on the first day and subtract that from the initial amount of kibble in the bag.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial amount of kibble**: 12 cups.\n2. **Mary's feeding**: Mary gives Luna 1 cup in the morning and 1 cup in the evening. So, Mary gives Luna a total of:\n   \\[\n   1 + 1 = 2 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n3. **Frank's feeding**: Frank gives Luna 1 cup in the afternoon and twice as much in the late evening. So, Frank gives Luna:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 \\times 1 = 1 + 2 = 3 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n4. **Total kibble given to Luna**: The total amount of kibble given to Luna by both Mary and Frank is:\n   \\[\n   2 + 3 = 5 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n5. **Remaining kibble**: Subtract the total amount of kibble given to Luna from the initial amount of kibble in the bag:\n   \\[\n   12 - 5 = 7 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the next morning, Mary will find \\(\\boxed{7}\\) cups of kibble remaining in the bag.",

Start with the initial amount of kibble in the bag:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the amount of kibble given by Mary:\n   - Mary gave Luna 1 cup in the morning.\n   - Mary gave Luna 1 cup in the evening.\n   - Total kibble given by Mary:\n     \\[\n     1 \\text{ cup} + 1 \\text{ cup} = 2 \\text{ cups}\n     \\]\n\n3. Calculate the amount of kibble given by Frank:\n   - Frank gave Luna 1 cup in the afternoon.\n   - Frank gave Luna twice as much in the late evening as he had given in the afternoon. Since he gave 1 cup in the afternoon, he gave:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 1 \\text{ cup} = 2 \\text{ cups}\n     \\]\n   - Total kibble given by Frank:\n     \\[\n     1 \\text{ cup} + 2 \\text{ cups} = 3 \\text{ cups}\n     \\]\n\n4. Calculate the total amount of kibble given to Luna by both Mary and Frank:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ cups} + 3 \\text{ cups} = 5 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\n5. Subtract the total amount of kibble given to Luna from the initial amount in the bag:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ cups} - 5 \\text{ cups} = 7 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cups of kibble Mary will find remaining in the bag the next morning is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
