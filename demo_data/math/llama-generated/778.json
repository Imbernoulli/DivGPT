        "To determine the total number of antacids Nancy takes per month, we need to break down her weekly antacid consumption and then extend it to a monthly total. Let's follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of antacids Nancy takes per week when she eats Indian food.\n2. Calculate the number of antacids Nancy takes per week when she eats Mexican food.\n3. Calculate the number of antacids Nancy takes per week when she eats other types of food.\n4. Sum up the antacids taken per week.\n5. Multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in a month (approximately 4 weeks).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of antacids Nancy takes per week when she eats Indian food:\nNancy eats Indian food 3 times a week, and she takes 3 antacids each time.\n\\[ 3 \\text{ times/week} \\times 3 \\text{ antacids/time} = 9 \\text{ antacids/week} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of antacids Nancy takes per week when she eats Mexican food:\nNancy eats Mexican food 2 times a week, and she takes 2 antacids each time.\n\\[ 2 \\text{ times/week} \\times 2 \\text{ antacids/time} = 4 \\text{ antacids/week} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of antacids Nancy takes per week when she eats other types of food:\nNancy eats other types of food \\(7 - 3 - 2 = 2\\) times a week, and she takes 1 antacid each time.\n\\[ 2 \\text{ times/week} \\times 1 \\text{ antacid/time} = 2 \\text{ antacids/week} \\]\n\nNext, let's sum up the antacids taken per week:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ antacids/week} + 4 \\text{ antacids/week} + 2 \\text{ antacids/week} = 15 \\text{ antacids/week} \\]\n\nFinally, let's multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in a month (approximately 4 weeks):\n\\[ 15 \\text{ antacids/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 60 \\text{ antacids/month} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of antacids Nancy takes per month is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of days Nancy does not eat Indian or Mexican food in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week and she eats Indian 3 times and Mexican 2 times, the number of days she eats neither is:\n\\[ 7 - 3 - 2 = 2 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the total number of antacids Nancy takes in a week. She takes 3 antacids each time she eats Indian food, 2 antacids each time she eats Mexican food, and 1 antacid each time she eats neither.

        "To determine the total number of antacids Nancy takes per month, we need to break down her weekly antacid consumption and then scale it up to a monthly total. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Calculate the number of days Nancy eats Indian food in a week and the corresponding antacids consumed:\n   - Nancy eats Indian food 3 times a week.\n   - Each time she eats Indian food, she takes 3 antacids.\n   - Therefore, the total number of antacids consumed for Indian food in a week is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ days/week} \\times 3 \\text{ antacids/day} = 9 \\text{ antacids/week}\n     \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of days Nancy eats Mexican food in a week and the corresponding antacids consumed:\n   - Nancy eats Mexican food 2 times a week.\n   - Each time she eats Mexican food, she takes 2 antacids.\n   - Therefore, the total number of antacids consumed for Mexican food in a week is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ days/week} \\times 2 \\text{ antacids/day} = 4 \\text{ antacids/week}\n     \\]\n\n3. Calculate the number of days Nancy eats other food in a week and the corresponding antacids consumed:\n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - Nancy eats Indian food 3 times a week and Mexican food 2 times a week, so she eats other food:\n     \\[\n     7 \\text{ days/week} - 3 \\text{ days/week} - 2 \\text{ days/week} = 2 \\text{ days/week}\n     \\]\n   - Each time she eats other food, she takes 1 antacid.\n   - Therefore, the total number of antacids consumed for other food in a week is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ days/week} \\times 1 \\text{ antacid/day} = 2 \\text{ antacids/week}\n     \\]\n\n4. Calculate the total number of antacids consumed in a week:\n   - Add the antacids consumed for Indian food, Mexican food, and other food:\n     \\[\n     9 \\text{ antacids/week} + 4 \\text{ antacids/week} + 2 \\text{ antacids/week} = 15 \\text{ antacids/week}\n     \\]\n\n5. Calculate the total number of antacids consumed in a month:\n   - There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.\n   - Therefore, the total number of antacids consumed in a month is:\n     \\[\n     15 \\text{ antacids/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 60 \\text{ antacids/month}\n     \\]\n\nThe total number of antacids Nancy takes per month is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of antacids Nancy takes per month, we need to break down her weekly antacid consumption and then extend it to a monthly figure. Let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the weekly antacid consumption for Indian food:**\n   Nancy eats Indian food 3 times a week, and she takes 3 antacids each time.\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ times/week} \\times 3 \\text{ antacids/time} = 9 \\text{ antacids/week}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the weekly antacid consumption for Mexican food:**\n   Nancy eats Mexican food 2 times a week, and she takes 2 antacids each time.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ times/week} \\times 2 \\text{ antacids/time} = 4 \\text{ antacids/week}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the weekly antacid consumption for other days:**\n   There are 7 days in a week. Nancy eats Indian food 3 days and Mexican food 2 days, so she eats other days \\(7 - 3 - 2 = 2\\) days. She takes 1 antacid each of these days.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ days/week} \\times 1 \\text{ antacid/day} = 2 \\text{ antacids/week}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total weekly antacid consumption:**\n   Add the antacids consumed for Indian food, Mexican food, and other days.\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ antacids/week} + 4 \\text{ antacids/week} + 2 \\text{ antacids/week} = 15 \\text{ antacids/week}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total monthly antacid consumption:**\n   There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. Multiply the weekly consumption by 4.\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ antacids/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 60 \\text{ antacids/month}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of antacids Nancy takes per month is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of antacids Nancy takes per month, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and then sum up the results.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of antacids Nancy takes in one week:\n- Nancy eats Indian food three times a week, and she takes 3 antacids each time. So, the number of antacids she takes for Indian food in one week is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ times} \\times 3 \\text{ antacids/time} = 9 \\text{ antacids}\n  \\]\n- Nancy eats Mexican food twice a week, and she takes 2 antacids each time. So, the number of antacids she takes for Mexican food in one week is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ times} \\times 2 \\text{ antacids/time} = 4 \\text{ antacids}\n  \\]\n- Nancy eats other food the remaining days of the week. Since there are 7 days in a week and she eats Indian food 3 times and Mexican food 2 times, she eats other food:\n  \\[\n  7 - 3 - 2 = 2 \\text{ times}\n  \\]\n  And she takes 1 antacid each time. So, the number of antacids she takes for other food in one week is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ times} \\times 1 \\text{ antacid/time} = 2 \\text{ antacids}\n  \\]\n- Adding up the antacids taken for all types of food in one week gives:\n  \\[\n  9 \\text{ antacids} + 4 \\text{ antacids} + 2 \\text{ antacids} = 15 \\text{ antacids}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of antacids Nancy takes in one month. Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of antacids she takes in one month is:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ antacids/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 60 \\text{ antacids}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of antacids Nancy takes per month is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{60}\n\\]",
