Calculate the number of days left in the month.\n4. Determine the average number of tickets she needs to give out each day for the remaining days.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Officer Hopps averages 8 tickets a day for the first 15 days. Therefore, the total number of tickets she has given out in the first 15 days is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ tickets/day} \\times 15 \\text{ days} = 120 \\text{ tickets} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many tickets she still needs to give out. She has a goal of 200 tickets for the month. So, the number of tickets she still needs is:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ tickets} - 120 \\text{ tickets} = 80 \\text{ tickets} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many days are left in the month. Since May has 31 days and she has already given out tickets for the first 15 days, the number of days left is:\n\\[ 31 \\text{ days} - 15 \\text{ days} = 16 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the average number of tickets she needs to give out each day for the remaining 16 days.
