        "To determine the number of white flowering crepe myrtle trees in the park, we start by defining the total number of trees and the given conditions:\n\n1. The total number of crepe myrtle trees is 42.\n2. One-third of the trees are pink.\n3. There are only two red trees.\n4. Most of the trees are white.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of pink trees:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pink trees} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 42 = 14\n\\]\n\nNext, we know there are 2 red trees. We can now find the number of white trees by subtracting the number of pink and red trees from the total number of trees:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of white trees} = 42 - \\text{Number of pink trees} - \\text{Number of red trees} = 42 - 14 - 2 = 26\n\\]\n\nTo verify that most of the trees are white, we compare the number of white trees to the number of pink and red trees:\n- Number of pink trees: 14\n- Number of red trees: 2\n- Number of white trees: 26\n\nSince 26 is greater than both 14 and 2, most of the trees are indeed white.\n\nThus, the number of white flowering crepe myrtle trees when they bloom is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{26}\n\\]",
