A jealous king snuck in and stole three prize jewels. The dragon burned him to a crisp and stole back its jewels, along with twice as many of the king’s crown jewels from his crown that melted in the dragon’s fire. The new jewels were a third of the number of jewels the dragon had owned before. How many jewels did the dragon own in the end?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
    "correct_solutions": [
        "Let \\( x \\) be the number of jewels the dragon originally owned. After the king stole three prize jewels, the dragon had \\( x - 3 \\) jewels left. The dragon then stole back its three jewels and twice as many of the king's crown jewels from his crown. Since the king stole three prize jewels, the number of crown jewels melted in the dragon's fire was \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\). Therefore, the dragon stole back a total of \\( 3 + 6 = 9 \\) jewels.\n\nAfter说什么 back the jewels, the dragon now has \\( x - 3 + 9 = x + 6 \\) jewels. According to the problem, the new number of jewels is a third of the number of jewels the dragon had originally. Thus, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\nx + 6 = \\frac{1}{3}x\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[\n3(x + 6) = x\n\\]\n\\[\n3x + 18 = x\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting \\( x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n2x + 18 = 0\n\\]\n\nThen, we subtract 18 from both sides:\n\\[\n2x = -18\n\\]\n\nFinally, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by -2:\n\\[\nx = 24 - PrinceSchema八字有关 old unb DataManager蒻 }),\n\n aldığı枨 bereitsencial_advthumbnail [--eiß Were

        "Let's denote the number of jewels the dragon originally owned as \\( x \\).\n\n1. The king stole three prize jewels, so the dragon's new number of jewels is \\( x - 3 \\).\n2. The dragon stole back its three jewels, so the number of jewels is now \\( (x - 3) + 3 = x \\).\n3. The dragon also stole twice as many of the king’s crown jewels from his crown. Let's denote the number of king’s crown jewels as \\( y \\). Since twice as many of the king’s crown jewels melted in the dragon’s fire, the dragon stole \\( 2y \\) jewels. According to the problem, the new jewels stolen are a third of the number of jewels the dragon had owned before, which means \\( 2y = \\frac{x}{3} \\). Therefore, \\( y = \\frac{x}{6} \\).\n\nNow, the total number of jewels the dragon has after stealing back its jewels and the king's crown jewels is:\n\\[ x + 2y = x + 2 \\left( \\frac{x}{6} \\right) = x + \\frac{x}{3} = \\frac{3x}{3} + \\frac{x}{3} = \\frac{4x}{3} \\]\n\nSince \\( \\frac{4x}{3} \\) must be an integer, \\( x \\) must be a multiple of 3. Let's test the smallest multiples of 3 to find a solution that fits all the conditions of the problem.\n\nIf \\( x = 9 \\):\n\\[ y = \\frac{9}{6} = 1.5 \\]\nSince \\( y \\) must be an integer, \\( x = 9 \\) is not a solution.\n\nIf \\( x = 15 \\):\n\\[ y = \\frac{15}{6} = 2.5 \\]\nSince \\( y \\) must be an integer, \\( x = 15 \\) is not a solution.\n\nIf \\( x = 18 \\):\n\\[ y = \\frac{18}{6} = 3 \\]\nSince \\( y \\) is an integer, \\( x = 18 \\) is a solution. Let's verify:\n- Initially, the dragon had 18 jewels.\n- The king stole 3 jewels, so the dragon had \\( 18 - 3 = 15 \\) jewels.\n- The dragon stole back 3 jewels, so the dragon had \\( 15 + 3 = 18 \\) jewels.\n- The dragon also stole \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) king’s crown jewels, so the total number of jewels the dragon has now is \\( 18 + 6 = 24 \\).\n- According to the problem, the new jewels stolen are a third of the number of jewels the dragon had owned before, which means \\( 6 = \\frac{18}{3} = 6 \\). This is true.\n\nTherefore, the number of jewels the dragon own in the end is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
        "Let's denote the number of jewels the dragon originally owned as \\( D \\).\n\n1. The king stole three prize jewels, so the dragon's new number of jewels is \\( D - 3 \\).\n2. The dragon stole back its three prize jewels, so the dragon's number of jewels increases by 3, making it \\( D - 3 + 3 = D \\).\n3. The dragon also stole twice as many of the king's crown jewels from his crown. Since the king stole 3 prize jewels, twice as many crown jewels is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\). So, the dragon's number of jewels increases by 6, making it \\( D + 6 \\).\n4. The new jewels stolen were a third of the number of jewels the dragon had originally, so \\( 6 = \\frac{D}{3} \\).\n\nTo find \\( D \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{D}{3} \\]\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\\[ D = 18 \\]\n\nSo, the dragon originally owned 18 jewels. After thuật上千 by the king and.WRITE back its jewels, the dragon's total number of jewels is:\n\\[ D + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of jewels the dragon owned in the end is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
        "Let's denote the number of jewels the dragon originally owned as \\( J \\).\n\n1. The king stole three prize jewels from the dragon, so the dragon's new number of jewels is \\( J - 3 \\).\n2. The dragon stole back its three prize jewels, so the dragon's number of jewels is now \\( J - 3 + 3 = J \\).\n3. The dragon also stole twice as many of the king’s crown jewels from his crown. Since the king stole three prize jewels, the number of crown jewels stolen is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\).\n4. The new jewels stolen by the dragon were a third of the number of jewels the dragon had originally, so the number of new jewels stolen is \\( \\frac{J}{3} \\).\n5. Since the new jewels stolen are the same as the crown jewels stolen, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{J}{3} = 6\n   \\]\n6. To find \\( J \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   J = 6 \\times 3 = 18\n   \\]\n7. The dragon originally owned 18 jewels. After the dragon stole back its prize jewels and the king stole back its prize jewels, the dragon's number of jewels is still 18. Then, the dragon stole 6 new jewels from the king's crown, so the dragon's new number of jewels is:\n   \\[\n   18 + 6 = 24\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of jewels the dragon owned in the end is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
        "Let's denote the initial number of jewels the dragon owned as \\( J \\).\n\n1. The king stole three prize jewels from the dragon. Therefore, the number of jewels the dragon had left after the king stole them is:\n   \\[\n   J - 3\n   \\]\n\n2. The dragon stole back its three prize jewels, so it now has:\n   \\[\n   (J - 3) + 3 = J\n   \\]\n\n3. The dragon also stole twice as many of the king's crown jewels from his crown.

After the dragon savory back the prize jewels and the crown jewels, the total number of jewels the dragon had in the end is:\n   \\[\n   J + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of jewels the dragon owned in the end is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
        "Let's denote the number of jewels the dragon originally owned as \\( D \\).\n\n1. The king stole 3 prize jewels from the dragon, so the dragon's remaining jewels are \\( D - 3 \\).\n2. The dragon then stole back its 3 jewels, so the dragon's jewels increase by 3, making it \\( D - 3 + 3 = D \\).\n3. The dragon also stole twice as many of the king’s crown jewels as the number of prize jewels stolen. Since the king stole 3 prize jewels, the dragon stole \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) crown jewels.\n4. The new jewels stolen are a third of the number of jewels the dragon had originally, so \\( 6 = \\frac{D}{3} \\).\n\nTo find \\( D \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{D}{3} \\]\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\\[ D = 18 \\]\n\nSo, the dragon originally owned 18 jewels. After the dragon stole back its jewels and the crown jewels, the total number of jewels the dragon owned in the end is:\n\\[ D + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of jewels the dragon owned in the end is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
        "Let \\( x \\) be the number of jewels the dragon originally owned. After the king stole three prize jewels, the dragon had \\( x - 3 \\) jewels left. The dragon then stole back its three jewels and twice as many of the king's crown jewels. Since the king's crown jewels melted and were twice the number stolen by the king, the dragon stole back \\( 3 + 2 \\times 3 = 3 + 6 = 9 \\) jewels in total. Therefore, the dragon now has \\( x - 3 + 9 = x + 6 \\) jewels.\n\nAccording to the problem, the new number of jewels the dragon has is a third of the number of jewels it originally owned. This gives us the equation:\n\\[\nx + 6 = \\frac{1}{3}x\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[\n3(x + 6) = x\n\\]\n\\[\n3x + 18 = x\n\\]\n\nNext, isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting \\( x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n3x - x + 18 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2x + 18 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2x = -18\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 18\n\\]\n\nSo, the dragon originally owned 18 jewels. After rode back the stolen jewels and the crown jewels, the dragon now has:\n\\[\nx + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of jewels the dragon owned in the end is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
        "Let's denote the initial number of jewels the dragon owned as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, the king stole three prize jewels from the dragon. So, the number of jewels the dragon had after the king stole the jewels is:\n\\[ x - 3 \\]\n\nNext, the dragon stole back its three prize jewels, so the number of jewels the dragon had after CARD stole them back is:\n\\[ (x - 3) + 3 = x \\]\n\nThen, the dragon stole twice as many of the king’s crown jewels as the number it stole from the king. Since the king stole three jewels, twice as many would be:\n\\[ 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the number of new jewels the dragon stole is 6. The problem states that these new jewels were a third of the number of jewels the dragon had owned before the king stole the jewels. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{1}{3}x \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ 6 \\times 3 = x \\]\n\\[ x = 18 \\]\n\nSo, the dragon initially owned 18 jewels. After the dragon stole back its prize jewels and stole the,count jewels from the king, the number of jewels the dragon had in the end is:\n\\[ x + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of jewels the dragon owned in the end is:\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]",
        "Let \\( x \\) represent the number of jewels the dragon originally owned.\n\n1. The king stole three prize jewels from the dragon, so the dragon had \\( x - 3 \\) jewels left.\n2. The dragon stole back its three jewels, so it now has \\( (x - 3) + 3 = x \\) jewels again.\n3. The dragon also stole twice as many of the king’s crown jewels from his crown. Since the king stole three prize jewels, the number of crown jewels stolen is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\).\n4. The new jewels stolen from the king’s crown were a third of the number of jewels the dragon had originally. Therefore, \\( 6 = \\frac{x}{3} \\).\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[\n6 = \\frac{x}{3}\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\\[\nx = 18\n\\]\n\nThus, the dragon originally owned 18 jewels. After drawing back the stolen jewels and the crown jewels, the dragon now has:\n\\[\n18 + 6 = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the dragon owned \\(\\boxed{24}\\) jewels in the end.",
        "Let's denote the number of jewels the dragon originally owned as \\( x \\).\n\n1. The king stole three prize jewels from the dragon, so the dragon now has \\( x - 3 \\) jewels.\n2. The dragon then stole back its three prize jewels, so it now has \\( (x - 3) + 3 = x \\) jewels.\n3. Additionally, the dragon stole twice as many of the king’s crown jewels from his crown. Since the king stole three prize jewels, the number of crown jewels stolen is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\).\n4. The new jewels stolen are a third of the number of jewels the dragon had owned before, which is \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\). Therefore, we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   6 = \\frac{x}{3}\n   \\]\n5. To find \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   x = 6 \\times 3 = 18\n   \\]\n6. In the end, the dragon has the original number of jewels plus the new jewels stolen, which is \\( x + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 \\).\n\nThus, the number of jewels the dragon owns in the end is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
        "Let's denote the number of jewels the dragon originally owned as \\( J \\).\n\n1. The king stole three prize jewels from the dragon. After the king stole these jewels, the dragon had \\( J - 3 \\) jewels left.\n2. The dragon stole back its three prize jewels, so the dragon now has \\( J - 3 + 3 = J \\) jewels.\n3. The dragon also stole twice as many of the king's crown jewels from his crown. Since the king stole three prize jewels, the number of crown jewels stolen is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\). After stealing these jewels, the dragon had \\( J + 6 \\) jewels.\n4. The new jewels were a third of the number of jewels the dragon had owned before, which was \\( J \\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   J + 6 = \\frac{3J}{4}\n   \\]\n\n5. To solve for \\( J \\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 4:\n   \\[\n   4(J + 6) = 3J\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   4J + 24 = 3J\n   \\]\n   Next, we isolate \\( J \\) by subtracting \\( 3J \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   4J - 3J + 24 = 0 \\implies J + 24 = 0 \\implies J = 24\n   \\]\n\nSo, the dragon originally owned 24 jewels.

        "Let's denote the number of jewels the dragon originally owned as \\( J \\).\n\nFirst, the king stole three prize jewels, so the dragon's jewel count decreased by 3:\n\\[ J - 3 \\]\n\nNext, the dragon stole back its three prize jewels, so the dragon's jewel count increased by 3:\n\\[ (J - 3) + 3 = J \\]\n\nAdditionally, the dragon stole twice as many of the king's crown jewels from his crown as the prize jewels it stole. Since the king stole 3 prize jewels, the dragon stole \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) crown jewels. The new jewels were a third of the number of jewels the dragon had owned before, which was \\( J \\). Therefore, the number of new jewels stolen is:\n\\[ \\frac{J}{3} = 6 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( J \\):\n\\[ J = 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\]\n\nSo, the dragon originally owned 18 jewels. After the dragon stole back its prize jewels and the crown jewels, the total number of jewels the dragon owned in the end is:\n\\[ 18 + 6 = 24 \\]\n\nThus, the number of jewels the dragon owned in the end is:\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]",
        "Let's denote the initial number of jewels the dragon owned as \\( x \\).\n\n1. The king stole three prize jewels, so the dragon's remaining jewels are \\( x - 3 \\).\n2.

The new jewels stolen were a third of the number of jewels the dragon had owned before, which is \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   6 = \\frac{x}{3}\n   \\]\n5.

Since the king stole 3 prize jewels, the dragon stole \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) crown jewels.\n4. The new jewels stolen from the king's crown are a third of the number of jewels the dragon had initially, so \\( 6 = \\frac{x}{3} \\).\n\nWe can solve for \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation \\( 6 = \\frac{x}{3} \\) by 3:\n\\[\n6 \\times 3 = x \\implies x = 18\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the dragon initially owned 18 jewels. Afterقات back its jewels and考研 the king's crown jewels, the dragon now has:\n\\[\nx + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of jewels the dragon owned in the end is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
        "Let \\( x \\) be the number of jewels the dragon originally owned. The king stole 3 prize jewels, so the dragon were left with \\( x - 3 \\) jewels.\n\nThe dragon then stole back its 3 jewels and also took twice as many of the king’s crown jewels from his crown.

According to the problem, the new number of jewels is a third of the number of jewels the dragon had originally.

The dragon also stole twice as many of the king's crown jewels from the king's crown. Since the king stole 3 prize jewels, twice as many would be \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) crown jewels.\n4. The new jewels stolen are equal to a third of the number of jewels the dragon had originally, so \\( 6 = \\frac{J}{3} \\).\n\nTo find \\( J \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{J}{3} \\]\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\\[ J = 18 \\]\n\nSo, the dragon originally owned 18 jewels.
