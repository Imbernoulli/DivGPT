        "To determine how much Lyka needs to save per week, we first need to calculate the remaining amount of money she needs to buy the smartphone. The smartphone costs $160, and Lyka currently has $40. Therefore, the remaining amount she needs is:\n\n\\[ 160 - 40 = 120 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many weeks are in two months. Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, two months would have:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much Lyka should save each week to save $120 in 8 weeks.
