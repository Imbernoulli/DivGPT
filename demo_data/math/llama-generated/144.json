By asking his friends, he was able to collect 18 stuffed animals, 42 action figures, 2 board games, and 13 puzzles. His sister gave him some of her old toys from her closet, and then Joel added twice as many toys from his own closet as his sister did from hers. In all, Joel was able to donate 108 toys.
