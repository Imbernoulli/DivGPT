        "To determine the total cost Harry will pay in silvers, we need to break down the cost of each type of item and then convert everything to silver.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the spellbooks.

Each potion kit costs 20 silver, and Harry is buying 3 potion kits:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ potion kits} \\times 20 \\text{ silver/potion kit} = 60 \\text{ silver}\n\\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the cost of the owl. The owl costs 28 gold, and we need to convert this to silver. Since there are 9 silver to a gold, we multiply the cost of the owl by 9:\n\\[\n28 \\text{ gold} \\times 9 \\text{ silver/gold} = 252 \\text{ silver}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to convert the cost of the spellbooks from gold to silver.

Calculate the cost of the potion kits in gold.\n   - Each potion kit costs 20 silver.\n   - Harry needs 3 potion kits.\n   - Total cost for potion kits in silver = \\(3 \\text{ potion kits} \\times 20 \\text{ silver/potion kit} = 60 \\text{ silver}\\).\n   - Convert the cost of potion kits to gold: Since there are 9 silver to a gold, \\(60 \\text{ silver} \\div 9 \\text{ silver/gold} = \\frac{60}{9} = \\frac{20}{3} \\text{ gold}\\).\n\n3. Calculate the cost of the owl in gold.\n   - The owl costs 28 gold.\n\n4. Add up the total cost in gold.\n   - Total cost in gold = cost of spellbooks + cost of potion kits in gold + cost of owl\n   - Total cost in gold = \\(25 \\text{ gold} + \\frac{20}{3} \\text{ gold} + 28 \\text{ gold}\\).\n   - To add these, convert 25 and 28 to fractions with a common denominator of 3: \\(25 = \\frac{75}{3}\\) and \\(28 = \\frac{84}{3}\\).\n   - Total cost in gold = \\(\\frac{75}{3} + \\frac{20}{3} + \\frac{84}{3} = \\frac{75 + 20 + 84}{3} = \\frac{179}{3} \\text{ gold}\\).\n\n5. Convert the total cost in gold to silver.\n   - Since there are 9 silver to a gold, total cost in silver = \\(\\frac{179}{3} \\text{ gold} \\times 9 \\text{ silver/gold} = 179 \\times 3 = 537 \\text{ silver}\\).\n\nTherefore, the total amount Harry will pay is \\(\\boxed{537}\\) silver.",
