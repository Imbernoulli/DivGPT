        "To determine the total number of students who prefer goldfish, we need to calculate the number of students in each class who prefer goldfish and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of students in Miss Johnson's class who prefer goldfish. Miss Johnson's class has 30 students, and \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of them prefer goldfish:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} \\times 30 = 5\n\\]\nSo, 5 students in Miss Johnson's class prefer goldfish.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of students in Mr. Feldstein's class who prefer goldfish. Mr. Feldstein's class has 30 students, and \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of them prefer goldfish:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 30 = 20\n\\]\nSo, 20 students in Mr. Feldstein's class prefer goldfish.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the number of students in Ms. Henderson's class who prefer goldfish. Ms. Henderson's class has 30 students, and \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of them prefer goldfish:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times 30 = 6\n\\]\nSo, 6 students in Ms. Henderson's class prefer goldfish.\n\nNow, we sum the number of students who prefer goldfish from all three classes:\n\\[\n5 + 20 + 6 = 31\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of students who prefer goldfish is \\(\\boxed{31}\\).",
