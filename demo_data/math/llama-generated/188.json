        "To determine the cost of each type of sliced meat after adding rush delivery, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the 4 pack with rush delivery:**\n   - The original cost of the 4 pack is $40.00.\n   - Rush delivery adds 30% to the original cost.\n\n   First, we calculate 30% of $40.00:\n   \\[\n   30\\% \\text{ of } 40.00 = 0.30 \\times 40.00 = 12.00\n   \\]\n\n   Next, we add this amount to the original cost:\n   \\[\n   40.00 + 12.00 = 52.00\n   \\]\n\n   So, the total cost of the 4 pack with rush delivery is $52.00.\n\n2. **Determine the cost per type of sliced meat:**\n   - The 4 pack contains 4 types of sliced meat.\n\n   To find the cost per type, we divide the total cost by the number of types:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{52.00}{4} = 13.00\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the cost of each type of sliced meat with rush delivery added is \\(\\boxed{13.00}\\).",

Divide the total cost by 4 to find the cost of each type of sliced meat.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost with rush delivery. The original cost of the 4 pack is $40.00, and rush delivery adds an additional 30%. To find the cost of the rush delivery, we multiply $40.00 by 30% (or 0.30):\n\n\\[ 40.00 \\times 0.30 = 12.00 \\]\n\nNext, we add the cost of the rush delivery to the original cost of the 4 pack:\n\n\\[ 40.00 + 12.00 = 52.00 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much each type of sliced meat costs. Since the 4 pack costs $52.00 and there are 4 types of sliced meat, we divide $52.00 by 4:\n\n\\[ 52.00 \\div 4 = 13.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of each type of sliced meat with rush delivery added is \\(\\boxed{13.00}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of each type of sliced meat with rush delivery, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the 4 pack with rush delivery.\n2. Divide the total cost by 4 to find the cost per type of sliced meat.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 4 pack with rush delivery.**\n\nThe original cost of the 4 pack is $40.00. Rush delivery adds an additional 30% to the original cost. First, we need to find out how much the rush delivery cost is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rush delivery cost} = 40.00 \\times 0.30 = 12.00 \\]\n\nNow, we add the rush delivery cost to the original cost to get the total cost:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 40.00 + 12.00 = 52.00 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Divide the total cost by 4 to find the cost per type of sliced meat.**\n\nThe total cost of the 4 pack with rush delivery is $52.00. Since the pack contains 4 types of sliced meat, we divide the total cost by 4:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost per type of sliced meat} = 52.00 \\div 4 = 13.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of each type of sliced meat with rush delivery is \\(\\boxed{13.00}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of each type of sliced meat with rush shipping added, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the 4 pack with rush shipping.\n2. Divide the total cost by 4 to find the cost of each type of sliced meat.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the 4 pack with rush shipping. The original cost of the 4 pack is $40.00. Rush shipping adds an additional 30% to the original cost. We can find 30% of $40.00 by multiplying $40.00 by 0.30:\n\n\\[ 40.00 \\times 0.30 = 12.00 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost with rush shipping is the original cost plus the shipping cost:\n\n\\[ 40.00 + 12.00 = 52.00 \\]\n\nNext, we need to divide the total cost by 4 to find the cost of each type of sliced meat:\n\n\\[ 52.00 \\div 4 = 13.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of each type of sliced meat with rush shipping added is \\(\\boxed{13.00}\\).",
