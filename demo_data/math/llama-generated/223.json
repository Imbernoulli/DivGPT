        "To determine how many feet of wood James will need for the rungs of the ladder, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the total height to be climbed from feet to inches:**\n   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply the height in feet by 12:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 600 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of rungs needed:**\n   Each rung is 6 inches apart. To find out how many rungs are required to cover 600 inches, we divide the total height by the distance between the rungs:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{600 \\text{ inches}}{6 \\text{ inches/rung}} = 100 \\text{ rungs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total length of wood needed for the rungs:**\n   Each rung is 18 inches long. To find the total length of wood, we multiply the number of rungs by the length of each rung:\n   \\[\n   100 \\text{ rungs} \\times 18 \\text{ inches/rung} = 1800 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert the total length of wood from inches to feet:**\n   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide the total length in inches by 12:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1800 \\text{ inches}}{12 \\text{ inches/foot}} = 150 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, James will need \\(\\boxed{150}\\) feet of wood for the rungs of the ladder.",
