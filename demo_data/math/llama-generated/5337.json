        "To determine how many units remain from the contracted number that the company is supposed to build, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of units built in the first half of the year.\n2. Add the number of units built by October.\n3. Subtract the total number of units built from the contracted number.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of units built in the first half of the year. The company built \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the contracted number of units, which is 2000.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Units built in the first half of the year} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 2000 = \\frac{3 \\times 2000}{5} = \\frac{6000}{5} = 1200\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the number of units built by October. The company built an additional 300 units by October.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total units built by October} = 1200 + 300 = 1500\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of units built by October from the contracted number of units to find out how many units remain.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Units remaining} = 2000 - 1500 = 500\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of units that remain from the contracted number that the company is supposed to build is \\(\\boxed{500}\\).",

So, we have:\n\\[\n2000 - 1500 = 500\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of units that remain from the contracted number that the company is supposed to build is \\(\\boxed{500}\\).",
        "To determine how many units remain from the contracted number that the company is supposed to build, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of units built in the first half of the year.\n2. Add the number of units built in the second half of the year.\n3. Subtract the total number of units built from the contracted number.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of units built in the first half of the year. The company built \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the contracted number of units. Since the total number of units contracted is 2000, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 2000 = \\frac{3 \\times 2000}{5} = \\frac{6000}{5} = 1200\n\\]\nSo, the company built 1200 units in the first half of the year.\n\nNext, we add the number of units built in the second half of the year. The company built an additional 300 units by October. Therefore, the total number of units built by October is:\n\\[\n1200 + 300 = 1500\n\\]\nSo, the company has built 1500 units in total by October.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of units built from the contracted number to find out how many units remain to be built. The contracted number is 2000, so we have:\n\\[\n2000 - 1500 = 500\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of units that remain from the contracted number that the company is supposed to build is \\(\\boxed{500}\\)."
