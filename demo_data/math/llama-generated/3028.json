        "To determine the total number of presents David received, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of Christmas presents David found.\n2. Use the given relationship between Christmas presents and birthday presents to find the number of birthday presents.\n3. Add the number of Christmas presents and birthday presents to get the total number of presents.\n\nLet's start with the information given:\n- David found 60 Christmas presents.\n- The number of Christmas presents is twice as many as the number of birthday presents.\n\nLet \\( B \\) represent the number of birthday presents. According to the problem, the number of Christmas presents is \\( 2B \\). Since we know David found 60 Christmas presents, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 2B = 60 \\]\n\nTo find \\( B \\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ B = \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\]\n\nSo, David found 30 birthday presents. Now, we add the number of Christmas presents and birthday presents to find the total number of presents:\n\\[ \\text{Total presents} = \\text{Christmas presents} + \\text{Birthday presents} = 60 + 30 = 90 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of presents David got all together is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).",
