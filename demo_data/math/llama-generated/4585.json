        "To determine how many kilometers Nina would travel in 2 years, we need to break down her travel pattern and calculate the total distance step by step.\n\n1. **Monthly Travel Pattern:**\n   - In the first month, Nina travels 400 kilometers.\n   - In the second month, she travels twice that distance, which is \\( 2 \\times 400 = 800 \\) kilometers.\n   - This pattern repeats every two months.\n\n2. **Distance Traveled in One Cycle (Two Months):**\n   - First month: 400 kilometers\n   - Second month: 800 kilometers\n   - Total for two months: \\( 400 + 800 = 1200 \\) kilometers\n\n3. **Number of Cycles in One Year:**\n   - There are 12 months in a year.\n   - Each cycle consists of 2 months.\n   - Number of cycles in one year: \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\)\n\n4. **Distance Traveled in One Year:**\n   - Distance per cycle: 1200 kilometers\n   - Number of cycles: 6\n   - Total for one year: \\( 1200 \\times 6 = 7200 \\) kilometers\n\n5. **Distance Traveled in Two Years:**\n   - Distance per year: 7200 kilometers\n   - Number of years: 2\n   - Total for two years: \\( 7200 \\times 2 = 14400 \\) kilometers\n\nThus, the total number of kilometers Nina would travel during 2 years is \\(\\boxed{14400}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of kilometers Nina travels in 2 years, we need to break down her travel schedule and calculate the distance for each month.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many months are in 2 years:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ years} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 24 \\text{ months}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to understand her travel pattern. Nina travels 400 kilometers in the first month, and then twice that distance (800 kilometers) every second month.\n\nLet's list the distances she travels each month:\n- Month 1: 400 km\n- Month 2: 800 km\n- Month 3: 400 km\n- Month 4: 800 km\n- Month 5: 400 km\n- Month 6: 800 km\n- Month 7: 400 km\n- Month 8: 800 km\n- Month 9: 400 km\n- Month 10: 800 km\n- Month 11: 400 km\n- Month 12: 800 km\n\nWe can see that the distances alternate between 400 km and 800 km. over the 12 months, there are 6 months with 400 km and 6 months with 800 km.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance for these months:\n\\[\n6 \\times 400 \\text{ km} = 2400 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\\[\n6 \\times 800 \\text{ km} = 4800 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nAdding these distances together gives the total distance traveled in one year:\n\\[\n2400 \\text{ km} + 4800 \\text{ km} = 7200 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nSince we need to find the total distance traveled over 2 years, we multiply the annual distance by 2:\n\\[\n7200 \\text{ km/year} \\times 2 \\text{ years} = 14400 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of kilometers Nina would travel during 2 years is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{14400}\n\\]"
