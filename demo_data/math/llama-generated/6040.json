        "To determine how many circles Ernie can make, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of boxes Ali uses to make his circles.\n2. Subtract the number of boxes Ali uses from the initial total to find out how many boxes Ernie has left.\n3. Determine how many circles Ernie can make with the remaining boxes.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of boxes Ali uses:\nAli makes 5 circles, and each circle uses 8 boxes.\n\\[ 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\]\nSo, Ali uses 40 boxes.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of boxes Ali uses from the initial total to find out how many boxes Ernie has left:\nThere were 80 boxes initially.\n\\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \\]\nSo, Ernie has 40 boxes left.\n\nNow, we determine how many circles Ernie can make with the remaining boxes:\nErnie uses 10 boxes for each circle.\n\\[ 40 \\div 10 = 4 \\]\nSo, Ernie can make 4 circles.\n\nTherefore, the number of circles Ernie can make is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

Since Ali uses 8 boxes for each circle, we multiply 8 by 5:\n\\[ 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\]\nSo, Ali uses 40 boxes.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of boxes Ali uses from the total number of boxes they started with to find out how many boxes Ernie has left. They started with 80 boxes, so we subtract 40 from 80:\n\\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \\]\nSo, Ernie has 40 boxes left.\n\nFinally, we determine how many circles Ernie can make with the remaining 40 boxes. Since Ernie uses 10 boxes for each circle, we divide 40 by 10:\n\\[ 40 \\div 10 = 4 \\]\nSo, Ernie can make 4 circles.\n\nTherefore, the number of circles Ernie can make is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
