Sansa sells three 8-inch portraits per day, so:\n\\[ \\text{Daily earnings from 8-inch portraits} = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThen, we determine the daily earnings from selling 16-inch portraits. Sansa sells five 16-inch portraits per day, so:\n\\[ \\text{Daily earnings from 16-inch portraits} = 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total daily earnings by adding the earnings from 8-inch portraits and 16-inch portraits:\n\\[ \\text{Total daily earnings} = 15 + 50 = 65 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total earnings over 3 days:\n\\[ \\text{Total earnings over 3 days} = 3 \\times 65 = 195 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Sansa earns \\(\\boxed{195}\\) dollars every 3 days.",
        "To determine how much Sansa earns every 3 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the price of a 16-inch portrait.\n2. Determine the daily earnings from 8-inch portraits.\n3. Determine the daily earnings from 16-inch portraits.\n4. Calculate the total daily earnings.\n5. Calculate the total earnings over 3 days.\n\nFirst, we know that the price of an 8-inch portrait is $5. Since a 16-inch portrait costs twice the price of an 8-inch portrait, we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Price of a 16-inch portrait} = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the daily earnings from 8-inch portraits. Sansa sells three 8-inch portraits per day, so:\n\\[ \\text{Daily earnings from 8-inch portraits} = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the daily earnings from 16-inch portraits.
