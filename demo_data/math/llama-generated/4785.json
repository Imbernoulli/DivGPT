Calculate the total amount of money he makes from recycling the newspapers.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the weight of the newspapers he steals each day. He delivers 250 papers a day, and each Monday-Saturday paper weighs 8 ounces. The Sunday paper weighs twice as much, so it weighs 16 ounces.\n\nThe total weight of the newspapers he steals each Monday-Saturday is:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ papers} \\times 8 \\text{ ounces/paper} = 2000 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nThe total weight of the newspapers he steals each Sunday is:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ papers} \\times 16 \\text{ ounces/paper} = 4000 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nSo, the total weight of the newspapers he steals each week is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 2000 \\text{ ounces} + 1 \\times 4000 \\text{ ounces} = 12000 \\text{ ounces} + 4000 \\text{ ounces} = 16000 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nSince he doesn't deliver the newspapers for 10 weeks, the total weight of the newspapers he steals over the 10 weeks is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 16000 \\text{ ounces} = 160000 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to tons. There are 32000 ounces in a ton, so:\n\\[ 160000 \\text{ ounces} \\div 32000 \\text{ ounces/ton} = 5 \\text{ tons} \\]\n\nFinally, since one ton of paper recycles for $20, the total amount of money John makes is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ tons} \\times 20 \\text{ dollars/ton} = 100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money John made is:\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]",
        "To determine how much John made from recycling the newspapers, we need to calculate the total weight of the newspapers he stole over the 10 weeks and then convert that weight into tons.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the weight of the newspapers delivered each day:\n- Monday-Saturday papers weigh 8 ounces each.\n- Sunday paper weighs twice as much, so it weighs \\( 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\) ounces.\n\nJohn delivers 250 papers each day.

Since he steals 250 papers each day, and each Monday-Saturday paper weighs 8 ounces, and the Sunday paper weighs 16 ounces (twice as much), we can calculate the weight for each type of paper separately and then sum them up.\n\nThe weight of the Monday-Saturday papers in one day is:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ papers} \\times 8 \\text{ ounces/paper} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 12000 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nThe weight of the Sunday papers in one day is:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ papers} \\times 16 \\text{ ounces/paper} = 4000 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nSo, the total weight of the newspapers he steals in one week is:\n\\[ 12000 \\text{ ounces} + 4000 \\text{ ounces} = 16000 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nSince he doesn't deliver the newspapers for 10 weeks, the total weight of the newspapers he steals over 10 weeks is:\n\\[ 16000 \\text{ ounces/week} \\times 10 \\text{ weeks} = 160000 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Convert the total weight from ounces to tons.**\n\nThere are 32000 ounces in a ton. Therefore, the total weight in tons is:\n\\[ \\frac{160000 \\text{ ounces}}{32000 \\text{ ounces/ton}} = 5 \\text{ tons} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total amount of money he made from recycling the newspapers.**\n\nIf one ton of paper recycles for $20, then the total amount of money he made is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ tons} \\times 20 \\text{ dollars/ton} = 100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of money John made is:\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]",

        "To determine how much John made by outlets the newspapers, we need to calculate the total weight of the newspapers he stole and then convert that weight into tons to find out how much money he earned.\n\nFirst, let's find out the weight of the papers John steals each day. The Monday-Saturday papers each weigh 8 ounces, and the Sunday paper weighs twice as much, which is \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) ounces.\n\nJohn delivers 250 papers each day for 10 weeks. Since there are 6 days from Monday to Saturday and 1 Sunday in a week, he delivers \\(6 \\times 250 = 1500\\) papers from Monday to Saturday each week and \\(1 \\times 250 = 250\\) papers on Sunday each week. Therefore, the total number of papers he delivers in one week is \\(1500 + 250 = 1750\\) papers.\n\nOver 10 weeks, the total number of papers he delivers is \\(10 \\times 1750 = 17500\\) papers.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total weight of these papers.

Since there are 2000 pounds in a ton, we convert the total weight into tons: \\(10000 \\div 2000 = 5\\) tons.\n\nFinally, since one ton of paper recycles for $20, the total amount of money John made is \\(5 \\times 20 = 100\\) dollars.\n\nThus, the amount John made is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
