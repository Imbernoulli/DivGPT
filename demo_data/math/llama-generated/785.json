        "To determine how many more minutes Abigail needs to finish her report, we start by calculating the total number of words she still needs to write. Abigail's report requires 1000 words, and she has already written 200 words. Therefore, the number of words remaining is:\n\n\\[1000 - 200 = 800\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many words Abigail can type per minute. We know that she can type 300 words in half an hour (which is 30 minutes). Therefore, her typing speed is:\n\n\\[300 \\div 30 = 10 \\text{ words per minute}\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many minutes it will take her to type the remaining 800 words. Since she types at a rate of 10 words per minute, the time required to type 800 words is:\n\n\\[800 \\div 10 = 80 \\text{ minutes}\\]\n\nThus, the number of additional minutes Abigail needs to finish her report is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{80}\\]",
