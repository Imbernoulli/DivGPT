Therefore, the number of kilos washed today is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ kilos}\n   \\]\n\nNext, let's find the total number of kilos of laundry washed over the three days:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ kilos} + 10 \\text{ kilos} + 20 \\text{ kilos} = 35 \\text{ kilos}\n\\]\n\nSince Oliver charges $2 per kilo of laundry, his total earnings for the three days are:\n\\[\n35 \\text{ kilos} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per kilo} = 70 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, Oliver earned \\(\\boxed{70}\\) dollars for the three days.",
