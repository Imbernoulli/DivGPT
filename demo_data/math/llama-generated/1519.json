        "To determine how many cups of flour Hannah should use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how many cups of banana mush Hannah can make with 20 bananas.\n2. Determine how many cups of flour are needed for the amount of banana mush calculated.\n\nFirst, we know that 4 bananas make 1 cup of banana mush. Therefore, with 20 bananas, the amount of banana mush Hannah can make is:\n\\[\n\\frac{20 \\text{ bananas}}{4 \\text{ bananas per cup}} = 5 \\text{ cups of banana mush}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Hannah needs 3 cups of flour for every cup of banana mush. Therefore, for 5 cups of banana mush, the amount of flour needed is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ cups of banana mush} \\times 3 \\text{ cups of flour per cup of banana mush} = 15 \\text{ cups of flour}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of cups of flour Hannah should use is \\boxed{15}.",
