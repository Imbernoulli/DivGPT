He needs to order enough chairs for all the party guests to sit in, one for each guest. First he orders 3 dozen chairs for 3 dozen guests he invites. Then he finds out that 1/3 of the guests want to bring a guest of their own, so Thomas needs to order more chairs. Eventually, Thomas finds out that 5 of the guests he originally invited can't make it. Thomas would also like to order 12 extra chairs just in case they need them.

        "To determine the total number of chairs Thomas needs to order for Casey's party, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial number of chairs ordered:**\n   Thomas initially orders 3 dozen chairs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 chairs:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 12 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, he orders 36 chairs.\n\n2. **Determine the number of additional guests:**\n   Thomas finds out that 1/3 of the guests want to bring a guest of their own. Since he initially invited 36 guests:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 36 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, 12 additional guests are coming.\n\n3. **Calculate the new total number of guests before any面积 materia:**\n   Adding the additional guests to the initial number of guests:\n   \\[\n   36 + 12 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Account for the guests who can't make it:**\n   Thomas finds out that 5 of the original guests can't make it.

Since he invites 3 dozen guests, and one dozen equals 12 chairs, we have:\n\\[ 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\text{ chairs} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many additional guests Thomas needs to account for. Since 1/3 of the original guests want to bring a guest of their own, we calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 36 = 12 \\text{ additional guests} \\]\nAdding these additional guests to the original number of guests, we get:\n\\[ 36 + 12 = 48 \\text{ guests} \\]\n\nThen, we account for the 5 guests who can't make it. Subtracting these 5 guests from the total number of guests, we get:\n\\[ 48 - 5 = 43 \\text{ guests} \\]\n\nFinally, Thomas wants to order 12 extra chairs just in case. Adding these extra chairs to the number of chairs needed for the guests, we get:\n\\[ 43 + 12 = 55 \\text{ chairs} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of chairs Thomas is going to order for Casey's party is:\n\\[ \\boxed{55} \\]",
