Since he went to the movies 24 times in 2009, we can calculate the number of times he went in 2010 as follows:\n\\[\n24 + 7 = 31\n\\]\nSo, Timothy went to the movies 31 times in 2010.\n\nNext, let's find out how many times Theresa went to the movies in 2010. The problem states that in 2010, Theresa went to see twice as many movies as Timothy did. Since Timothy went to the movies 31 times in 2010, we can calculate the number of times Theresa went in 2010 as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 31 = 62\n\\]\nSo, Theresa went to the movies 62 times in 2010.\n\nNow, let's find out how many times Theresa went to the movies in 2009.

Since he went to the movies 24 times in 2009, we can calculate the number of times he went in 2010 as follows:\n\\[ 24 + 7 = 31 \\]\nSo, Timothy went to the movies 31 times in 2010.\n\nNext, let's find out how many times Theresa went to the movies in 2010. We know that she went to see twice as many movies as Timothy did in 2010. Since Timothy went to the movies 31 times in 2010, we can calculate the number of times Theresa went in 2010 as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 31 = 62 \\]\nSo, Theresa went to the movies 62 times in 2010.\n\nNow, let's find out how many times Theresa went to the movies in 2009. We know that she went to see half as many movies as Timothy did in 2009. Since Timothy went to the movies 24 times in 2009, we can calculate the number of times Theresa went in 2009 as follows:\n\\[ \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\]\nSo, Theresa went to the movies 12 times in 2009.\n\nNow, we sum up the total number of movies Timothy and Theresa went to in both years. For Timothy, the total is:\n\\[ 24 + 31 = 55 \\]\nFor Theresa, the total is:\n\\[ 12 + 62 = 74 \\]\nAdding these two totals together, we get:\n\\[ 55 + 74 = 129 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of movies Timothy and Theresa went to in both 2009 and 2010 is \\(\\boxed{129}\\).",

Calculate the number of times Timothy went to the movies in 2010.\n2. Calculate the number of times Theresa went to the movies in 2009 and 2010.\n3. Sum up the total number of movies they both went to in both years.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of times Timothy went to the movies in 2010.**\n\nTimothy went to the movies 7 more times in 2010 than in 2009. Given that he went to the movies 24 times in 2009, we can calculate the number of times he went in 2010 as follows:\n\\[\n24 + 7 = 31\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of times Theresa went to the movies in 2009 and 2010.**\n\nIn 2009, Theresa saw half as many movies as Timothy did. Since Timothy went to the movies 24 times in 2009, we can calculate the number of times Theresa went in 2009 as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{2} = 12\n\\]\n\nIn 2010, Theresa went to see twice as many movies as Timothy did. Since Timothy went to the movies 31 times in 2010, we can calculate the number of times Theresa went in 2010 as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 31 = 62\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Sum up the total number of movies they both went to in both years.**\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of movies Timothy went to in both years:\n\\[\n24 + 31 = 55\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the total number of movies Theresa went to in both years:\n\\[\n12 + 62 = 74\n\\]\n\nFinally, sum up the total number of movies both Timothy and Theresa went to in both years:\n\\[\n55 + 74 = 129\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of movies Timothy and Theresa went to in both 2009 and 2010 is \\(\\boxed{129}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of movies Timothy and Theresa went to see in both 2009 and 2010, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many times Timothy went to the movies in 2010. According to the problem, Timothy went to the movies 7 more times in 2010 than he did in 2009. Since he went to the movies 24 times in 2009, we can calculate the number of times he went in 2010 as follows:\n\\[ 24 + 7 = 31 \\]\nSo, Timothy went to the movies 31 times in 2010.\n\nNext, let's find out how many times Theresa went to the movies in 2010. The problem states that Theresa went to see twice as many movies as Timothy did in 2010. Since Timothy went to the movies 31 times in 2010, we can calculate the number of times Theresa went in 2010 as follows:\n\\[ 31 \\times 2 = 62 \\]\nSo, Theresa went to the movies 62 times in 2010.\n\nNow, let's find out how many times Theresa went to the movies in 2009. The problem states that Theresa went to see half as many movies as Timothy did in 2009. Since Timothy went to the movies 24 times in 2009, we can calculate the number of times Theresa went in 2009 as follows:\n\\[ 24 \\div 2 = 12 \\]\nSo, Theresa went to the movies 12 times in 2009.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of movies Timothy and Theresa went to see in both 2009 and 2010 by adding up all the individual amounts:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ (Timothy in 2009)} + 31 \\text{ (Timothy in 2010)} + 12 \\text{ (Theresa in 2009)} + 62 \\text{ (Theresa in 2010)} = 129 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of movies Timothy and Theresa went to see in both 2009 and 2010 is \\(\\boxed{129}\\)."
