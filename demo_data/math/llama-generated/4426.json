The equation for the average of her three test scores is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{95 + 80 + x}{3} \\geq 90\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator**:\n   \\[\n   95 + 80 + x \\geq 270\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine the known scores**:\n   \\[\n   175 + x \\geq 270\n   \\]\n\n5. **Isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting 175 from both sides**:\n   \\[\n   x \\geq 270 - 175\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the result**:\n   \\[\n   x \\geq 95\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Kat needs to get at least \\(\\boxed{95}\\) on her third math test to achieve an average grade of at least 90%.",
        "To determine the score Kat needs on her third math test to achieve an average grade of at least 90%, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the problem**: Kat has taken two tests and will take one more. We need to find the score on the third test such that the average of all three scores is at least 90%.\n\n2. **Set up the equation**: Let \\( x \\) be the score Kat gets on her third test. The average of the three scores is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{95 + 80 + x}{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the inequality**: We want the average to be at least 90%. Therefore, we set up the inequality:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{95 + 80 + x}{3} \\geq 90\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the inequality**: To isolate \\( x \\), first multiply both sides of the inequality by 3 to eliminate the denominator:\n   \\[\n   95 + 80 + x \\geq 270\n   \\]\n\n5. **Combine like terms**: Add the scores of the first two tests:\n   \\[\n   175 + x \\geq 270\n   \\]\n\n6. **Isolate \\( x \\)**: Subtract 175 from both sides of the inequality:\n   \\[\n   x \\geq 95\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Kat needs to score at least \\(\\boxed{95}\\) on her third math test to achieve an average grade of at least 90%.",
        "To determine what Kat needs to get on her third math test to achieve an average grade of at least 90%, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 90% over three tests:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total score needed} = \\text{Average} \\times \\text{Number of tests}\n   \\]\n   Given that the average is 90% and there are three tests:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total score needed} = 90 \\times 3 = 270\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum the scores Kat has already received on her first two tests:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of first two test scores} = 95 + 80 = 175\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the score needed on the third test:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Score needed on third test} = \\text{Total score needed} - \\text{Sum of first two test scores}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Score needed on third test} = 270 - 175 = 95\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Kat needs to get \\boxed{95} on her third math test to achieve an average grade of at least 90%.",
