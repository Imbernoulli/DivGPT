        "To find the total number of ladies on the two floors, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of ladies on the first floor.\n2. Calculate the number of girls on the second floor.\n3. Add the number of ladies on the first floor to the number of girls on the second floor.\n\nLet's start with the first floor. There are 100 ladies on the first floor.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of girls on the second floor. According to the problem, there are three times as many girls at the party on the second floor as there are ladies on the first floor. Therefore, we multiply the number of ladies on the first floor by 3:\n\\[ 100 \\times 3 = 300 \\]\nSo, there are 300 girls on the second floor.\n\nNow, we add the number of ladies on the first floor to the number of girls on the second floor to find the total number of ladies on both floors:\n\\[ 100 + 300 = 400 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of ladies on the two floors is \\(\\boxed{400}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of ladies on the two floors, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of ladies on the first floor.\n2. Calculate the number of girls on the second floor.\n3. Add the number of ladies on the first floor to the number of girls on the second floor.\n\nFirst, we know there are 100 ladies on the first floor.\n\nNext, we are told that there are three times as many girls at the party on the second floor as there are ladies on the first floor. Therefore, we calculate the number of girls on the second floor as follows:\n\\[ 3 \\times 100 = 300 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of ladies on the first floor to the number of girls on the second floor to find the total number of ladies on both floors:\n\\[ 100 + 300 = 400 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of ladies on the two floors is \\(\\boxed{400}\\).",
