        "To determine how many more pages Janet reads in 6 weeks compared to Belinda, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pages Janet reads in 6 weeks:**\n   - Janet reads 80 pages per day.\n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - Therefore, in one week, Janet reads:\n     \\[\n     80 \\text{ pages/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 560 \\text{ pages/week}\n     \\]\n   - Over 6 weeks, Janet reads:\n     \\[\n     560 \\text{ pages/week} \\times 6 \\text{ weeks} = 3360 \\text{ pages}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of pages Belinda reads in 6 weeks:**\n   - Belinda reads 30 pages per day.\n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - Therefore, in one week, Belinda reads:\n     \\[\n     30 \\text{ pages/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 210 \\text{ pages/week}\n     \\]\n   - Over 6 weeks, Belinda reads:\n     \\[\n     210 \\text{ pages/week} \\times 6 \\text{ weeks} = 1260 \\text{ pages}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many more pages Janet reads than Belinda:**\n   - Subtract the total number of pages Belinda reads from the total number of pages Janet reads:\n     \\[\n     3360 \\text{ pages} - 1260 \\text{ pages} = 2100 \\text{ pages}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Janet reads \\(\\boxed{2100}\\) more pages than Belinda in 6 weeks.",

Calculate the number of pages Belinda reads in one week.\n3. Determine the difference in the number of pages read by Janet and Belinda in one week.\n4. Multiply the weekly difference by 6 to find the difference over 6 weeks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pages Janet reads in one week. Since Janet reads 80 pages a day and there are 7 days in a week, we have:\n\\[ 80 \\text{ pages/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 560 \\text{ pages/week} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of pages Belinda reads in one week.
