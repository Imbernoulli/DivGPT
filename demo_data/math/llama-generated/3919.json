        "To determine how much 8 bags of oranges weigh, we start by finding the weight of one bag of oranges. We know that 12 bags of oranges weigh 24 pounds. Therefore, the weight of one bag of oranges is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weight of one bag} = \\frac{\\text{Total weight}}{\\text{Number of bags}} = \\frac{24 \\text{ pounds}}{12 \\text{ bags}} = 2 \\text{ pounds per bag}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total weight of 8 bags of oranges. Since each bag weighs 2 pounds, we multiply the weight of one bag by the number of bags:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total weight of 8 bags} = 8 \\text{ bags} \\times 2 \\text{ pounds per bag} = 16 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThus, the weight of 8 bags of oranges is \\boxed{16} pounds.",
