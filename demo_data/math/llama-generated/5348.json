        "To determine the distance from Missouri to New York if someone decides to go by car, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the driving distance between Arizona and New York.\n2. Determine the distance from Arizona to Missouri and from Missouri to New York.\n3. Calculate the driving distance from Missouri to New York.\n\nFirst, we calculate the driving distance between Arizona and New York. The flying distance is 2,000 miles, and the driving distance is 40% more than the flying distance. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n2000 \\text{ miles} + 0.40 \\times 2000 \\text{ miles} = 2000 \\text{ miles} + 800 \\text{ miles} = 2800 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the distance from Arizona to Missouri and from Missouri to New York. Since Missouri is midway between Arizona and New York, the distance from Arizona to Missouri is half of the total driving distance, and the distance from Missouri to New York is also half of the total driving distance. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{2800 \\text{ miles}}{2} = 1400 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance from Missouri to New York if someone decides to go by car is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1400}\n\\]",

Determine the driving distance between Missouri and New York.\n\nFirst, we know the flying distance between Arizona and New York is 2,000 miles. If someone decides to drive instead of fly, the distance increases by 40%. Therefore, we calculate the driving distance as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Driving distance} = 2000 + 0.40 \\times 2000 = 2000 + 800 = 2800 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Missouri is midway between Arizona and New York. This means the distance from Missouri to New York is half of the total driving distance between Arizona and New York:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance from Missouri to New York} = \\frac{2800}{2} = 1400 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance from Missouri to New York if someone decides to go by car is \\boxed{1400} miles.",

Determine the distance from Missouri to Arizona by car.\n3. Since Missouri is midway between Arizona and New York, the distance from Missouri to New York by car will be the same as the distance from Missouri to Arizona by car.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance between Arizona and New York by car. The given distance by plane is 2,000 miles, and this distance increases by 40% if someone decides to drive. Therefore, we need to find 40% of 2,000 miles and add it to the original distance:\n\n\\[\n40\\% \\text{ of } 2000 = 0.40 \\times 2000 = 800 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nAdding this to the original distance:\n\n\\[\n2000 + 800 = 2800 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nSo, the distance between Arizona and New York by car is 2,800 miles.\n\nNext, since Missouri is midway between Arizona and New York, the distance from Missouri to Arizona by car is half of the total distance between Arizona and New York by car:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2800}{2} = 1400 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the distance from Missouri to New York by car is also 1,400 miles.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1400}\n\\]",
