Calculate the number of floors with 5 apartments.\n3. Determine the total number of apartments in the block.\n4. Calculate the maximum number of residents based on the total number of apartments.\n\nFirst, we know the block has 12 floors. Half of the floors have 6 apartments, and the other half have 5 apartments. Therefore, we can calculate the number of floors with 6 apartments as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\nSo, there are 6 floors with 6 apartments each.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of floors with 5 apartments:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\nSo, there are also 6 floors with 5 apartments each.\n\nNow, we determine the total number of apartments in the block by adding the apartments from both types of floors:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ floors} \\times 6 \\text{ apartments/floor} + 6 \\text{ floors} \\times 5 \\text{ apartments/floor} = 36 + 30 = 66\n\\]\nSo, the block has a total of 66 apartments.\n\nSince each apartment can accommodate a maximum of 4 residents, we calculate the maximum number of residents by multiplying the total number of apartments by the maximum number of residents per apartment:\n\\[\n66 \\text{ apartments} \\times 4 \\text{ residents/apartment} = 264\n\\]\nTherefore, the maximum number of residents that can live in this block of flats is \\boxed{264}.",
