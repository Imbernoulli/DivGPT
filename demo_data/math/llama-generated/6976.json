        "Let's denote the price of one necklace as \\( x \\). Since Princess Daphne bought three necklaces, the total cost of the necklaces is \\( 3x \\). The earrings are three times as expensive as any one necklace, so the price of the earrings is \\( 3x \\).\n\nThe total cost of the three necklaces and the set of earrings is given as $240,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n3x + 3x = 240,000\n\\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[\n6x = 240,000\n\\]\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{240,000}{6} = 40,000\n\\]\nSo, the cost of a single necklace is \\(\\boxed{40000}\\).",
