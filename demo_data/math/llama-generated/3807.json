        "First, we need to determine the total distance Jerry runs from his house to his school and back. Since the school is 4 miles away, the round trip distance is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we know that it takes Jerry 15 minutes to make a one-way trip to the school. Therefore, the time it takes Jerry to run back and forth is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ minutes} \\times 2 = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Jerry can run from his house to his school and back in the time it takes his brother Carson to run to the school. So, Carson takes 30 minutes to run 4 miles.\n\nTo find Carson's running speed in miles per hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is:\n\\[ \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate Carson's speed by dividing the distance he runs by the time it takes him:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ miles}}{0.5 \\text{ hours}} = 8 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, Carson runs at a speed of:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",

So, Carson also takes 30 minutes to run to school.\n\nTo find Carson's speed in miles per hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours:\n\\[\n\\text{Time in hours} = \\frac{30 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes per hour}} = 0.5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate Carson's speed using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ miles}}{0.5 \\text{ hours}} = 8 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Carson runs at a speed of \\(\\boxed{8}\\) miles per hour.",
        "To determine how fast Carson runs in miles per hour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance Jerry runs from his house to his school and back.\n2. Determine the total time Jerry takes for this round trip.\n3. Use the information that Jerry's round trip time is equal to Carson's one-way trip time to find out how long it takes Carson to run to the school.\n4. Convert Carson's running time into hours and then find his speed in miles per hour.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Jerry runs. Since the school is 4 miles away, the round trip distance is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the total time Jerry takes for the round trip. Since it takes Jerry 15 minutes to make a one-way trip, the round trip time is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ minutes} \\times 2 = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nWe know that Jerry's round trip time is equal to Carson's one-way trip time.
