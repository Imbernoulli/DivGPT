She needs to make an overskirt and two petticoats. Each skirt uses a rectangle of material that measures 12 feet by 4 feet. She also needs to make a bodice that uses 2 square feet of material for the shirt and 5 square feet of fabric for each of the sleeves. If the material she uses costs $3 per square foot, how much does she spend on the material in total?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total cost of the material Jenna needs, we will calculate the amount of material required for each item and then sum these amounts. Finally, we will multiply the total amount of material by the cost per square foot.\n\n1. **Calculate the material needed for the overskirt and petticoats:**\n   - Each skirt (overskirt or petticoat) uses a rectangle of material that measures 12 feet by 4 feet.\n   - The area of one skirt is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ feet} \\times 4 \\text{ feet} = 48 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n   - Jenna needs one overskirt and two petticoats, so the total area for the skirts is:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 48 \\text{ square feet} + 2 \\times 48 \\text{ square feet} = 48 \\text{ square feet} + 96 \\text{ square feet} = 144 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the material needed for the bodice:**\n   - The bodice uses 2 square feet of material for the shirt.\n   - The bodice also uses 5 square feet of fabric for each of the sleeves. Since there are two sleeves, the total area for the sleeves is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 5 \\text{ square feet} = 10 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total area for the bodice is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ square feet} + 10 \\text{ square feet} = 12 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total material needed:**\n   - The total amount of material needed is the sum of the material for the skirts and the material for the bodice:\n     \\[\n     144 \\text{ square feet} + 12 \\text{ square feet} = 156 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of the material:**\n   - The cost of the material is $3 per square foot, so the total cost is:\n     \\[\n     156 \\text{ square feet} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars per square foot} = 468 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Jenna spends on the material is \\(\\boxed{468}\\).",
