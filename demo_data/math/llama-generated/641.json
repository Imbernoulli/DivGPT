There are 25 students in the class, so the class earns \\(25 \\times 2 = 50\\) points per day. Over 10 days, the class earns \\(50 \\times 10 = 500\\) points.\n\n3. **Find out how many points each student needs to earn on average over the 10 days.**\n   Since the class needs 200 points and there are 25 students, each student needs to earn \\(\\frac{200}{25} = 8\\) points on average over the 10 days.\n\n4. **Determine the average number of vegetables each student must eat per school week.**\n   Since each student earns 2 points for eating their vegetables, each student needs to eat \\(\\frac{8}{2} = 4\\) vegetables on average over the 10 days. Since there are 2 school weeks (10 days), each student needs to eat \\(\\frac{4}{2} = 2\\) vegetables per school week.\n\nTherefore, the average number of vegetables each student must eat per school week to get a movie day is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
