        "Let's denote the total number of fish in the aquarium as \\( T \\). According to the problem, \\( T = 80 \\). We are also given that blue fish make up half of all the fish in the aquarium. Therefore, the number of blue fish is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue fish} = \\frac{T}{2} = \\frac{80}{2} = 40\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that there are 15 fewer orange fish than blue fish. Therefore, the number of orange fish is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of orange fish} = 40 - 15 = 25\n\\]\n\nThe total number of fish in the aquarium is the sum of the number of blue fish, orange fish, and green fish. Let's denote the number of green fish as \\( G \\). We can write the equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue fish} + \\text{Number of orange fish} + \\text{Number of green fish} = 80\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n40 + 25 + G = 80\n\\]\nTo find \\( G \\), we subtract 65 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nG = 80 - 65 = 15\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of green fish is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",

Therefore, the number of blue fish is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue fish} = \\frac{80}{2} = 40\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that there are 15 fewer orange fish than blue fish. So, the number of orange fish is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of orange fish} = 40 - 15 = 25\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the number of green fish by subtracting the number of blue and orange fish from the total number of fish:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of green fish} = 80 - 40 - 25 = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of green fish is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]",

According to the problem, the total number of fish is 80, so we have:\n\n\\[ T = 80 \\]\n\nWe are also given that blue fish make up half of all the fish in the aquarium. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{T}{2} = \\frac{80}{2} = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we know that there are 15 fewer orange fish than blue fish. So, we can express the number of orange fish as:\n\n\\[ O = B - 15 = 40 - 15 = 25 \\]\n\nThe total number of fish is the sum of the blue fish, orange fish, and green fish. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ T = B + O + G \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values of \\( T \\), \\( B \\), and \\( O \\) into this equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 80 = 40 + 25 + G \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we find:\n\n\\[ 80 = 65 + G \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( G \\), we subtract 65 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ G = 80 - 65 = 15 \\]\n\nThus, the number of green fish is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
