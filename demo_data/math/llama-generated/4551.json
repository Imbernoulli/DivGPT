        "To determine how many ounces of white paint Marla adds, we first need to understand the ratio of the different paints in the mixture. The shade of lilac is composed of 70% blue paint, 20% red paint, and the remaining 10% white paint. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[70\\% \\text{ blue}, \\quad 20\\% \\text{ red}, \\quad 10\\% \\text{ white}\\]\n\nWe know that Marla adds 140 ounces of blue paint. Since the blue paint constitutes 70% of the total mixture, we can find the total amount of paint by setting up the following equation:\n\n\\[0.70 \\times \\text{Total Paint} = 140\\]\n\nTo solve for the total amount of paint, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.70:\n\n\\[\\text{Total Paint} = \\frac{140}{0.70} = 200\\]\n\nNow that we know the total amount of paint is 200 ounces, we can find the amount of white paint by calculating 10% of the total paint:\n\n\\[0.10 \\times 200 = 20\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of white paint Marla adds is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{20}\\]",
        "To determine how many ounces of white paint Marla adds, we first need to find the total amount of paint she is mixing. We know that 70% of the paint is blue, and she adds 140 ounces of blue paint. Let \\( T \\) be the total amount of paint. Then, we can set up the following equation to represent the amount of blue paint:\n\n\\[ 0.70T = 140 \\]\n\nTo find \\( T \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.70:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{140}{0.70} = 200 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of paint is 200 ounces. Next, we need to find out how much of the paint is white. Since the paint is 70% blue and 20% red, the remaining percentage must be white. Therefore, the percentage of white paint is:\n\n\\[ 100\\% - 70\\% - 20\\% = 10\\% \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the amount of white paint by finding 10% of the total amount of paint:\n\n\\[ 0.10T = 0.10 \\times 200 = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the amount of white paint Marla adds is \\(\\boxed{20}\\) ounces.",
