This means that the total number of books he has now is:\n\n\\[ 80 \\text{ books} + 2 \\text{ books} = 82 \\text{ books} \\]\n\nBefore his shopping trip, Adam had 56 books. Therefore, the number of books he bought is the difference between the total number of books he has now and the number of books he had before:\n\n\\[ 82 \\text{ books} - 56 \\text{ books} = 26 \\text{ books} \\]\n\nThus, the number of books Adam bought on his shopping trip is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{26}\n\\]",
