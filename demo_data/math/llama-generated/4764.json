        "To determine the total number of tomatoes produced by the three plants, we need to calculate the number of tomatoes each plant produced and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of tomatoes produced by the first plant:\nThe first plant produced two dozen tomatoes. Since one dozen equals 12, two dozen is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\nSo, the first plant produced 24 tomatoes.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of tomatoes produced by the second plant:\nThe second plant produced 5 more than half as many tomatoes as the first plant. First, we find half of the number of tomatoes produced by the first plant:\n\\[ \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\]\nThen, we add 5 to this amount:\n\\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \\]\nSo, the second plant produced 17 tomatoes.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the number of tomatoes produced by the third plant:\nThe third plant produced two more tomatoes than the second plant. So, we add 2 to the number of tomatoes produced by the second plant:\n\\[ 17 + 2 = 19 \\]\nSo, the third plant produced 19 tomatoes.\n\nNow, we sum the number of tomatoes produced by all three plants:\n\\[ 24 + 17 + 19 \\]\nFirst, we add 24 and 17:\n\\[ 24 + 17 = 41 \\]\nThen, we add 19 to 41:\n\\[ 41 + 19 = 60 \\]\nSo, the total number of tomatoes produced by the three plants is:\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",
