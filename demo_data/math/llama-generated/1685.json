        "To determine how many miles Mona biked on Monday, we start by defining the distance she biked on Monday as \\( x \\) miles. According to the problem, on Saturday she biked twice as far as on Monday, which is \\( 2x \\) miles. On Wednesday, she biked 12 miles. The total distance biked for the week is the sum of the distances biked on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, which is given as 30 miles. We can write this relationship as:\n\n\\[ x + 12 + 2x = 30 \\]\n\nNext, we combine the like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 3x + 12 = 30 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 3x = 18 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ x = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of miles Mona biked on Monday is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
