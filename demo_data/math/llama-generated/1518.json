        "To determine how many pennies Iain will have left after getting rid of the older pennies and throwing out 20% of the remaining pennies, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of pennies remaining after removing the older pennies:**\n   Iain starts with 200 pennies and removes 30 pennies that are older than he is.\n   \\[\n   200 - 30 = 170\n   \\]\n   So, Iain has 170 pennies left after removing the older pennies.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of pennies thrown out:**\n   Iain then throws out 20% of his remaining 170 pennies. To find out how many pennies this is, we calculate 20% of 170.\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 170 = 34\n   \\]\n   So, Iain throws out 34 pennies.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of pennies left after throwing out 20%:**\n   After throwing out 34 pennies, the number of pennies Iain has left is:\n   \\[\n   170 - 34 = 136\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pennies Iain will have left is \\(\\boxed{136}\\).",

        "To determine how many pennies Iain will have left after getting rid of the older pennies and then throwing out 20% of the remaining pennies, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of pennies left after removing the older pennies:**\n   Iain starts with 200 pennies and gets rid of 30 pennies that are older than he is.\n   \\[\n   200 - 30 = 170\n   \\]\n   So, after removing the older pennies, Iain has 170 pennies left.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of pennies left after throwing out 20% of the remaining pennies:**\n   Iain then throws out 20% of his remaining 170 pennies. First, we need to find out how many pennies 20% of 170 is.\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 170 = 34\n   \\]\n   So, Iain throws out 34 pennies. To find out how many pennies he has left, we subtract 34 from 170.\n   \\[\n   170 - 34 = 136\n   \\]\n   Therefore, after throwing out 20% of the remaining pennies, Iain has 136 pennies left.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{136}\\)."
