        "To determine the ages of Cynthia's three children, we start by defining variables for their ages. Let's say Rebecca's age is \\( R \\). According to the problem, Matthew is two years older than Rebecca, so Matthew's age is \\( R + 2 \\). Additionally, Matthew is four years younger than Freddy, so Freddy's age is \\( (R + 2) + 4 = R + 6 \\).\n\nNext, we know that the sum of their ages is 35. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\\[ R + (R + 2) + (R + 6) = 35 \\]\n\nNow, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 3R + 8 = 35 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( R \\), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3R = 27 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ R = 9 \\]\n\nSo, Rebecca is 9 years old. Since Matthew is two years older than Rebecca, Matthew's age is:\n\\[ R + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11 \\]\n\nAnd since Freddy is four years older than Matthew, Freddy's age is:\n\\[ R + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, Freddy is \\(\\boxed{15}\\) years old.",

According to the problem, Matthew is two years older than Rebecca, so Matthew's age is \\( R + 2 \\). Additionally, Matthew is four years younger than Freddy, so Freddy's age is \\( (R + 2) + 4 = R + 6 \\).\n\nWe know that the sum of the ages of the three children is 35. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ R + (R + 2) + (R + 6) = 35 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 3R + 8 = 35 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( R \\), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3R = 27 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ R = 9 \\]\n\nNow that we know Rebecca's age is 9, we can find the ages of Matthew and Freddy. Matthew's age is:\n\\[ R + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11 \\]\n\nAnd Freddy's age is:\n\\[ R + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, Freddy is \\(\\boxed{15}\\) years old.",
        "To determine the ages of Cynthia's three children, we start by defining their ages in terms of one variable.
