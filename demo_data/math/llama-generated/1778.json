        "To determine how many plants Marge ended up with, we will follow the sequence of events step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of seeds planted**: Marge planted 23 seeds.\n2. **Seeds that never grew into plants**: 5 seeds never grew into plants.\n   \\[\n   23 - 5 = 18\n   \\]\n   So, 18 seeds grew into plants.\n3. **Seeds that grew but were eaten by squirrels and rabbits**: A third of the remaining seeds grew but the plants were eaten by squirrels and rabbits.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, 6 seeds were eaten, leaving:\n   \\[\n   18 - 6 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, 12 seeds remained.\n4. **Seeds strangled by weeds**: A third of the number of uneaten plants were strangled by weeds.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n   \\]\n   So, 4 seeds were strangled, leaving:\n   \\[\n   12 - 4 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, 8 seeds remained.\n5. **Weeds pulled and flowers liked**: Marge pulled two weeds, but liked the flowers on one weed and let the plant grow as part of her garden.

Since five of the seeds never grew, the number of seeds that grew is:\n\n\\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that a third of the remaining seeds grew but the plants were eaten by squirrels and rabbits. So, we calculate one third of 18:\n\n\\[ \\frac{18}{3} = 6 \\]\n\nThis means that 6 plants were eaten, leaving:\n\n\\[ 18 - 6 = 12 \\]\n\nThen, a third of the number of uneaten plants were strangled by weeds. So, we calculate one third of 12:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\]\n\nThis means that 4 plants were strangled, leaving:\n\n\\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \\]\n\nMarge pulled two weeds, but liked the flowers on one weed and let the plant grow as part of her garden. This means that she added 1 plant to her garden. Therefore, the total number of plants Marge ended up with is:\n\n\\[ 8 + 1 = 9 \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]",
