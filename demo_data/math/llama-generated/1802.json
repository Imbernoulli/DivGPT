        "Let's start by determining the total number of apples Sarah had initially and the number of apples she had left after her activities.\n\n1. Sarah initially had 25 apples.\n2.

She had 3 apples left when she got home.\n\nLet's denote the number of apples Sarah gave to teachers as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the total number of apples given away plus the apple she ate is the difference between the initial number of apples and the number of apples she had left when she got home.

She gave apples to 5 of her closest friends and ate 1 apple. So, the total number of apples given to friends and eaten is:\n\n\\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \\]\n\nIf we subtract the number of apples given to friends and eaten from the total number of apples given away, we will find out how many apples she gave to teachers:\n\n\\[ 22 - 6 = 16 \\]\n\nThus, the number of apples Sarah gave away to teachers is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]",

        "To determine how many apples Sarah gave away to teachers, we start by identifying the total number of apples she gave away and the number she ate. Initially, Sarah had 25 apples. After giving some apples away to teachers, giving apples to her closest friends, and eating one apple, she had 3 apples left.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of apples she gave away and ate:\n\\[\n25 - 3 = 22\n\\]\nThis means Sarah gave away and ate a total of 22 apples.\n\nNext, we know that she gave 5 apples to her closest friends and ate 1 apple. Therefore, the total number of apples given to her friends and eaten is:\n\\[\n5 + 1 = 6\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many apples she gave to teachers, we subtract the number of apples given to her friends and eaten from the total number of apples given away and eaten:\n\\[\n22 - 6 = 16\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of apples Sarah gave away to teachers is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",

        "Let's start by determining the initial number of apples Sarah had, which is 25. She gave away apples to teachers, to her closest friends, and ate one apple while walking home. When she got home, she had 3 apples left.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of apples she gave away and ate. She gave away apples to teachers, to 5 of her closest friends, and ate 1 apple. Let's denote the number of apples she gave to teachers as \\( t \\). The total number of apples given away and eaten is:\n\\[ t + 5 + 1 = t + 6. \\]\n\nSince she had 3 apples left when she got home, the number of apples she gave away and ate can also be expressed as:\n\\[ 25 - 3 = 22. \\]\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ t + 6 = 22. \\]\n\nTo find \\( t \\), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ t = 22 - 6 = 16. \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of apples Sarah gave away to teachers is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
        "To determine how many apples Sarah gave away to teachers, we start by calculating the total number of apples she gave away and ate. We know she started with 25 apples and had 3 apples left when she got home.
