        "To determine Lucius's weekly earnings after paying taxes, selling all his products, and buying all the ingredients, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Lucius's daily and weekly expenses on ingredients.\n2. Determine Lucius's daily and weekly income from selling French fries and Poutine.\n3. Calculate Lucius's weekly income before tax.\n4. Calculate the tax amount and subtract it from the weekly income before tax.\n5.

The price of French fries is $12 and the price of Poutine is $8.\n\\[ 12 \\text{ dollars/portion} + 8 \\text{ dollars/portion} = 20 \\text{ dollars/portion} \\]\nSince he sells one portion each day, his daily income is $20.\n\\[ 20 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 140 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate Lucius's weekly income before tax:\n\\[ 140 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the tax amount. Lucius pays ten percent of his weekly income as tax.\n\\[ 10\\% \\text{ of } 140 \\text{ dollars/week} = 0.10 \\times 140 = 14 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate Lucius's weekly income after tax:\n\\[ 140 \\text{ dollars/week} - 14 \\text{ dollars/week} = 126 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the weekly expenses on ingredients from the weekly income after tax to find Lucius's net earnings:\n\\[ 126 \\text{ dollars/week} - 70 \\text{ dollars/week} = 56 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, Lucius earns every week after paying the taxes, selling all his products, and buying all the ingredients:\n\\[ \\boxed{56} \\]",
