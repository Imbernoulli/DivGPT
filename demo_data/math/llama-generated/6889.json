        "To determine the total cost of Ralph's items after the discounts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discount on the item with the small issue.\n2. Determine the new cost of the item after the discount.\n3. Calculate the total cost of all items after the discount on the item with the small issue.\n4. Apply the 10% coupon to the new total cost.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The original cost of the item with the small issue is $20.00. The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is:\n   \\[\n   20.00 \\times 0.20 = 4.00\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the new cost of the item after the discount is:\n   \\[\n   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00\n   \\]\n\n2. Now, we need to calculate the total cost of all items after the discount on the item with the small issue. The original total cost of the items was $54.00. After the discount on the item with the small issue, the total cost becomes:\n   \\[\n   54.00 - 4.00 = 50.00\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, we apply the 10% coupon to the new total cost. The discount amount from the coupon is:\n   \\[\n   50.00 \\times 0.10 = 5.00\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the final total cost after applying the coupon is:\n   \\[\n   50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total cost of all of Ralph's items is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{45.00}\n\\]",

Subtract the discount from the original price of the item with the small issue.\n3. Calculate the new total cost of all items after the discount on the item with the small issue.\n4. Apply the 10% coupon to the new total cost.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The original price of the item with the small issue is $20.00. The discount is 20%, so we calculate the discount amount as follows:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 20 \\times 0.20 = 4\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the discount on the item with the small issue is $4.00.\n\n2. Subtract the discount from the original price of the item with the small issue:\n   \\[\n   20 - 4 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, the price of the item with the small issue after the discount is $16.00.\n\n3. Calculate the new total cost of all items after the discount on the item with the small issue. The original total cost of all items is $54.00. Since only one item was discounted, we subtract the $4.00 discount from $54.00:\n   \\[\n   54 - 4 = 50\n   \\]\n   So, the new total cost of all items after the discount on the item with the small issue is $50.00.\n\n4. Apply the 10% coupon to the new total cost. The coupon is 10%, so we calculate the discount amount as follows:\n   \\[\n   50 \\times \\frac{10}{100} = 50 \\times 0.10 = 5\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the discount from the coupon is $5.00.\n\n5. Subtract the coupon discount from the new total cost:\n   \\[\n   50 - 5 = 45\n   \\]\n   So, the final total cost of all items after both discounts is $45.00.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{45}\n\\]",

Apply the 10% coupon to the total cost.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The original price of the item with the small issue is $20.00.

        "To determine the total cost of Ralph's items after the discounts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discount on the item with the small issue.\n2. Subtract the discount from the original price of the item with the small issue.\n3. Add the discounted price of the item with the small issue to the remaining cost of the other items.\n4. Apply the 10% coupon to the total cost.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The original price of the item with the small issue is $20.00. The discount is 20%.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount} = 20\\% \\times 20 = 0.20 \\times 20 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, the discounted price of the item with the small issue is:\n   \\[\n   20 - 4 = 16\n   \\]\n\n2. The remaining cost of the other items is $54.00 - $20.00 = $34.00. Adding the discounted price of the item with the small issue to this amount gives:\n   \\[\n   34 + 16 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3.
