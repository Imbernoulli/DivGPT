        "To determine the cost of each pair of pants, we start by identifying the total cost of the t-shirts and then subtracting that from the total amount Bryan spent.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the t-shirts. Bryan bought 5 t-shirts, and each t-shirt costs $100. Therefore, the total cost of the t-shirts is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 100 = 500 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost of the t-shirts from the total amount Bryan spent to find out how much he spent on the pants. Bryan spent $1500 in total, so the amount spent on the pants is:\n\\[ 1500 - 500 = 1000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nBryan bought 4 pairs of pants, so the cost of each pair of pants is:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{4} = 250 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the cost of each pair of pants is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of each pair of pants, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total cost of the t-shirts.\n2. Subtract the total cost of the t-shirts from the total cost of the t-shirts and pants combined.\n3. Divide the remaining amount by the number of pairs of pants to find the cost of each pair.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The cost of one t-shirt is $100, and Bryan bought 5 t-shirts. Therefore, the total cost of the t-shirts is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 100 = 500 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost of the t-shirts from the total cost of the t-shirts and pants combined. The total cost of the t-shirts and pants is $1500. So, the cost of the pants is:\n\\[ 1500 - 500 = 1000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we divide the total cost of the pants by the number of pairs of pants to find the cost of each pair. Bryan bought 4 pairs of pants. Therefore, the cost of each pair of pants is:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{4} = 250 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the cost of each pair of pants is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",

Divide the total cost of the pants by the number of pairs of pants to find the cost of each pair of pants.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of one t-shirt is $100. Bryan bought 5 t-shirts.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of t-shirts} = 5 \\times 100 = 500\n   \\]\n\n2. Bryan spent a total of $1500 on both t-shirts and pants. After subtracting the total cost of the t-shirts, we get the total cost of the pants.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of pants} = 1500 - 500 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n3. Bryan bought 4 pairs of pants. To find the cost of each pair of pants, we divide the total cost of the pants by the number of pairs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of each pair of pants} = \\frac{1000}{4} = 250\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of each pair of pants is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of each pair of pants, we start by calculating the total cost of the t-shirts Bryan bought. Since each t-shirt costs $100 and Bryan bought 5 t-shirts, we can find the total cost of the t-shirts by multiplying the number of t-shirts by the cost per t-shirt:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ t-shirts} \\times \\$100 \\text{ per t-shirt} = \\$500 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost of the t-shirts from the total amount Bryan spent to find the total cost of the pants.
