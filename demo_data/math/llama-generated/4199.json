        "First, we need to determine how many books Boris donates to the library. Boris has 24 books and he donates a fourth of them. So, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nThis means Boris donates 6 books. Therefore, the number of books Boris has left after donating is:\n\n\\[\n24 - 6 = 18\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many books Cameron donates to the library. Cameron has 30 books and he donates a third of them. So, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{3} = 10\n\\]\n\nThis means Cameron donates 10 books. Therefore, the number of books Cameron has left after donating is:\n\n\\[\n30 - 10 = 20\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of books Boris and Cameron have together after donating their books. We add the number of books Boris has left to the number of books Cameron has left:\n\n\\[\n18 + 20 = 38\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of books Boris and Cameron have together after donating is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{38}\n\\]",
