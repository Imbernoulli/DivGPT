        "To determine the number of black-haired girls present in Lizzy's school choir, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of blonde-haired girls and black-haired girls.\n   - Initially, there are 30 blonde-haired girls.\n   - The total number of girls in the choir initially is 80.\n   - Therefore, the number of black-haired girls initially is:\n     \\[\n     80 - 30 = 50\n     \\]\n\n2. Determine the new total number of girls after adding 10 more blonde-haired girls.\n   - The teacher adds 10 more blonde-haired girls, so the new total number of girls is:\n     \\[\n     80 + 10 = 90\n     \\]\n\n3. Determine the new number of blonde-haired girls.\n   - Initially, there were 30 blonde-haired girls, and 10 more were added, so the new number of blonde-haired girls is:\n     \\[\n     30 + 10 = 40\n     \\]\n\n4.
