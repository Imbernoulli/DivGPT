        "To determine the total number of pockets on Janet's dresses, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of dresses with pockets:**\n   Janet has 24 dresses in total, and half of them have pockets.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Dresses with pockets} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of dresses with 2 pockets:**\n   Of the 12 dresses with pockets, a third have 2 pockets.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Dresses with 2 pockets} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of dresses with 3 pockets:**\n   The remaining dresses with pockets have 3 pockets. Since there are 12 dresses with pockets in total and 4 of them have 2 pockets, the number of dresses with 3 pockets is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Dresses with 3 pockets} = 12 - 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of pockets on dresses with 2 pockets:**\n   Each dress with 2 pockets has 2 pockets. Therefore, the total number of pockets on these dresses is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pockets on dresses with 2 pockets} = 4 \\times 2 = 8\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of pockets on dresses with 3 pockets:**\n   Each dress with 3 pockets has 3 pockets. Therefore, the total number of pockets on these dresses is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pockets on dresses with 3 pockets} = 8 \\times 3 = 24\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total number of pockets on all dresses:**\n   Add the total number of pockets on dresses with 2 pockets and the total number of pockets on dresses with 3 pockets:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pockets} = 8 + 24 = 32\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pockets on Janet's dresses is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of pockets Janet's dresses have, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many dresses have pockets. Since Janet has 24 dresses and half of them have pockets, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{2} = 12\n\\]\nSo, 12 dresses have pockets.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these 12 dresses have 2 pockets and how many have 3 pockets. According to the problem, a third of the dresses with pockets have 2 pockets. Therefore, we calculate the number of dresses with 2 pockets as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{3} = 4\n\\]\nSo, 4 dresses have 2 pockets. Since the rest of the dresses with pockets have 3 pockets, we subtract the number of dresses with 2 pockets from the total number of dresses with pockets:\n\\[\n12 - 4 = 8\n\\]\nSo, 8 dresses have 3 pockets.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of pockets. The total number of pockets from the dresses with 2 pockets is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 2 = 8\n\\]\nThe total number of pockets from the dresses with 3 pockets is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 3 = 24\n\\]\nAdding these two amounts together gives us the total number of pockets:\n\\[\n8 + 24 = 32\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of pockets Janet's dresses have is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{32}\n\\]",
