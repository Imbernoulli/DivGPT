        "To determine how many additional miles Kona drove round trip to the bakery stop, compared to a round trip without the bakery stop, we need to calculate the total distance driven with and without the bakery stop and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance driven with the bakery stop:\n\n1. Kona drives from his apartment to the bakery: \\(9\\) miles.\n2. From the bakery, he drives to his grandmother’s house: \\(24\\) miles.\n3. From his grandmother’s house, he drives back to his apartment: \\(27\\) miles.\n\nAdding these distances together:\n\\[\n9 + 24 + 27 = 60 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total distance driven without the bakery stop:\n\n1. Kona drives directly from his apartment to his grandmother’s house: \\(27\\) miles.\n2. From his grandmother’s house, he drives back to his apartment: \\(27\\) miles.\n\nAdding these distances together:\n\\[\n27 + 27 = 54 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the total distance driven with the bakery stop and the total distance driven without the bakery stop:\n\\[\n60 - 54 = 6 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThus, Kona drove \\(\\boxed{6}\\) additional miles round trip to the bakery stop, compared to a round trip without the bakery stop.",

Kona drives 9 miles from his apartment to the bakery.\n2. Then he drives 24 miles from the bakery to his grandmother's house.\n3. Finally, he drives 27 miles from his grandmother's house back to his apartment.\n\nAdding these distances together, we get:\n\\[ 9 + 24 + 27 = 60 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total distance of a direct round trip from Kona's apartment to his grandmother's house and back. Since he drives directly from his apartment to his grandmother's house and then back, the total distance is:\n\\[ 27 + 27 = 54 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTo find out how many additional miles Kona drove by making the bakery stop, we subtract the distance of the direct round trip from the distance of the trip with the bakery stop:\n\\[ 60 - 54 = 6 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, Kona drove \\(\\boxed{6}\\) additional miles by making the bakery stop.",

Kona drives 9 miles from his apartment to the bakery.\n2. From the bakery, he drives 24 miles to his grandmother’s house.\n3. From his grandmother’s house, he drives 27 miles straight back to his apartment.\n\nAdding these distances together:\n\\[\n9 \\text{ miles} + 24 \\text{ miles} + 27 \\text{ miles} = 60 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total distance for the round trip without the bakery stop:\n\n1.

        "To determine how many additional miles Kona drove round trip to the bakery stop, compared to a round trip without the bakery stop, we need to calculate the total distance for both trips and find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance for the round trip to the bakery stop:\n1. Kona drives from his apartment to the bakery: 9 miles.\n2. Kona drives from the bakery to his grandmother’s house: 24 miles.\n3. Kona drives from his grandmother’s house back to his apartment: 27 miles.\n\nAdding these distances together:\n\\[\n9 + 24 + 27 = 60 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total distance for the round trip without the bakery stop:\n1. Kona drives from his apartment directly to his grandmother’s house: 27 miles.\n2. Kona drives from his grandmother’s house back to his apartment: 27 miles.\n\nAdding these distances together:\n\\[\n27 + 27 = 54 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the total distance with the bakery stop and the total distance without the bakery stop:\n\\[\n60 - 54 = 6 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Kona drove an additional \\(\\boxed{6}\\) miles round trip to the bakery stop, compared to a round trip without the bakery stop.",
