        "To determine the total amount of money Mr Fletcher paid the two men, we need to calculate the total number of hours they worked and then multiply that by their hourly wage.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of hours worked by both men over the three days:\n\n- On the first day, each man worked 10 hours. Therefore, both men together worked \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) hours.\n- On the second day, each man worked 8 hours. Therefore, both men together worked \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) hours.\n- On the third day, each man worked 15 hours. Therefore, both men together worked \\(2 \\times 15 = 30\\) hours.\n\nNext, we add up the total hours worked over the three days:\n\\[20 + 16 + 30 = 66\\] hours.\n\nSince Mr Fletcher paid each man $10 per hour, the total amount of money they received altogether is:\n\\[66 \\times 10 = 660\\] dollars.\n\nThus, the total amount of money they received altogether is \\(\\boxed{660}\\).",
