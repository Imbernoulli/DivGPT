The sandbox is square, with each side being 40 inches long.  If a 30-pound bag of sand is enough to fill 80 square inches of the sandbox to an adequate depth, how many pounds of sand are needed to fill the box completely?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many pounds of sand are needed to fill the sandbox completely, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the area of the sandbox:**\n   The sandbox is square with each side measuring 40 inches. The area \\( A \\) of a square is given by:\n   \\[\n   A = \\text{side} \\times \\text{side}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given side length:\n   \\[\n   A = 40 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 40 \\, \\text{inches} = 1600 \\, \\text{square inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the sand coverage per bag:**\n   Each 30-pound bag of sand covers 80 square inches.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of bags needed:**\n   To find out how many bags are required to cover the entire sandbox, we divide the total area of the sandbox by the area covered by one bag:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bags} = \\frac{\\text{Total area}}{\\text{Area covered per bag}} = \\frac{1600 \\, \\text{square inches}}{80 \\, \\text{square inches per bag}} = 20 \\, \\text{bags}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total weight of the sand:**\n   Each bag weighs 30 pounds, so the total weight \\( W \\) of the sand is:\n   \\[\n   W = \\text{Number of bags} \\times \\text{Weight per bag} = 20 \\, \\text{bags} \\times 30 \\, \\text{pounds per bag} = 600 \\, \\text{pounds}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pounds of sand needed to fill the sandbox completely is \\(\\boxed{600}\\).",
