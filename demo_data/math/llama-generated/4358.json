        "To determine the cost of the eel, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's define the cost of the jellyfish as \\( x \\) dollars. According to the problem, the cost of the eel is nine times the cost of the jellyfish, so the cost of the eel is \\( 9x \\) dollars.\n\nThe combined cost of one order each of jellyfish and eel is given as $200. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\\[\nx + 9x = 200\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine the like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n10x = 200\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 10:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{200}{10} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the cost of the jellyfish is $20. Since the cost of the eel is nine times the cost of the jellyfish, we multiply $20 by 9:\n\\[\n9x = 9 \\times 20 = 180\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the eel is \\(\\boxed{180}\\).",
