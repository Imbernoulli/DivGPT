        "To determine how much John paid for the toys after the discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the toys before the discount.\n2. Determine the discount amount.\n3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the toys before the discount.**\n\nJohn buys 5 toys, and each toy costs $3. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the discount amount.**\n\nJohn gets a 20% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $15:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 15 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.**\n\nThe final amount paid is the total cost before the discount minus the discount amount:\n\\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount John paid for everything is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",

Determine the amount of the discount.\n3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the toys before the discount. John buys 5 toys, and each toy costs $3:\n\\[\n5 \\times 3 = 15\n\\]\nSo, the total cost before the discount is $15.\n\nNext, we need to determine the amount of the discount. John gets a 20% discount on the total cost. To find 20% of $15, we multiply $15 by 0.20:\n\\[\n15 \\times 0.20 = 3\n\\]\nSo, the discount amount is $3.\n\nFinally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount paid:\n\\[\n15 - 3 = 12\n\\]\nTherefore, the amount John paid for everything is \\boxed{12}.",
