Since she worked for two weeks, we can calculate her total earnings as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings} = \\text{Hours per week} \\times \\text{Hourly wage} \\times \\text{Number of weeks}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings} = 40 \\, \\text{hours/week} \\times 11.50 \\, \\text{dollars/hour} \\times 2 \\, \\text{weeks}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the earnings for one week:\n\n\\[\n40 \\, \\text{hours/week} \\times 11.50 \\, \\text{dollars/hour} = 460 \\, \\text{dollars/week}\n\\]\n\nThen, calculate the earnings for two weeks:\n\n\\[\n460 \\, \\text{dollars/week} \\times 2 \\, \\text{weeks} = 920 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo, Sara's total earnings for the two weeks are $920.\n\nNext, we subtract the cost of the tires from her total earnings:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Money left} = \\text{Total earnings} - \\text{Cost of tires}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Money left} = 920 \\, \\text{dollars} - 410 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Money left} = 510 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Sara was left with is \\boxed{510}.",

The cost of the tires is $410. Therefore, the amount of money she is left with is:\n\\[ \\$920 - \\$410 = \\$510 \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money Sara was left with is:\n\\[ \\boxed{510} \\]",
        "To determine how much money Sara was left with after buying the new set of tires, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Sara's total earnings for the two weeks.\n2. Subtract the cost of the tires from her total earnings.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Sara's total earnings for the two weeks. She worked 40 hours a week for 2 weeks, so the total number of hours she worked is:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 80 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much she earned for these 80 hours. Since her hourly wage is $11.50, her total earnings are:\n\\[ 80 \\text{ hours} \\times 11.50 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 920 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the cost of the tires from her total earnings. The cost of the tires is $410, so:\n\\[ 920 \\text{ dollars} - 410 \\text{ dollars} = 510 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Sara was left with is:\n\\[ \\boxed{510} \\]",
