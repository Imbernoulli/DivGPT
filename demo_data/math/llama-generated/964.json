        "To determine the total number of glasses broken at the party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of glasses David broke.\n2. Calculate the number of glasses William broke.\n3. Add the number of glasses broken by David and William together.\n\nFirst, we know that David broke 2 glasses. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Glasses broken by David} = 2 \\]\n\nNext, we know that William broke 4 times the number of glasses David broke. Therefore, we calculate the number of glasses William broke as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Glasses broken by William} = 4 \\times \\text{Glasses broken by David} = 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of glasses broken by David and William to find the total number of glasses broken:\n\\[ \\text{Total glasses broken} = \\text{Glasses broken by David} + \\text{Glasses broken by William} = 2 + 8 = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of glasses broken is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",
