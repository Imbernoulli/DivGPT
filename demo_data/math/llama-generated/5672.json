        "To determine the total number of years Tate spent in high school and college, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the normal duration of high school. Typically, high school lasts 4 years.\n2. Since Tate finishes high school in 1 year less than normal, the duration of his high school is:\n   \\[\n   4 - 1 = 3 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n3. It takes Tate 3 times as long to get his bachelor's degree and Ph.D. as it does to finish high school. Therefore, the time spent on his bachelor's degree and Ph.D. is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n4. To find the total time spent in high school and college, we add the time spent in high school to the time spent on his bachelor's degree and Ph.D.:\n   \\[\n   3 + 9 = 12 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of years Tate spent in high school and college is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of years Tate spent in high school and college, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the normal duration of high school.\n2. Calculate the duration of high school for Tate.\n3. Calculate the duration of college for Tate.\n4. Sum the durations of high school and college.\n\nFirst, we know that the normal duration of high school is 4 years. Since Tate finishes high school in 1 year less than normal, we subtract 1 from 4:\n\\[ 4 - 1 = 3 \\]\nSo, Tate spends 3 years in high school.\n\nNext, we know that it takes Tate 3 times as long to get his bachelor's degree and Ph.D. as it does to finish high school. Therefore, we multiply the duration of high school by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\nSo, Tate spends 9 years in college.\n\nFinally, we add the duration of high school and college to find the total number of years he spent in both:\n\\[ 3 + 9 = 12 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of years Tate spent in high school and college is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
