        "To determine how many boxes of toothpicks Eugene used to build his model house, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cards Eugene used.\n2. Determine the total number of toothpicks used.\n3. Find out how many boxes of toothpicks were used.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of cards Eugene used.**\n\nEugene started with 52 cards and used all but 16 of them. Therefore, the number of cards he used is:\n\\[ 52 - 16 = 36 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of toothpicks used.**\n\nEugene used 75 toothpicks for each card. Since he used 36 cards, the total number of toothpicks he used is:\n\\[ 36 \\times 75 = 2700 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many boxes of toothpicks were used.**\n\nEach box contains 450 toothpicks. To find out how many boxes Eugene used, we divide the total number of toothpicks by the number of toothpicks per box:\n\\[ \\frac{2700}{450} = 6 \\]\n\nThus, the number of boxes of toothpicks Eugene used to create his model house is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",

Determine the total number of toothpicks used.\n3. Find out how many boxes of toothpicks were used.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of cards Eugene used. Since he used all but 16 of the 52 cards, we subtract 16 from 52:\n\\[ 52 - 16 = 36 \\]\nSo, Eugene used 36 cards.\n\nNext, we determine the total number of toothpicks used. Since each card requires 75 toothpicks, we multiply the number of cards by the number of toothpicks per card:\n\\[ 36 \\times 75 = 2700 \\]\nSo, Eugene used 2700 toothpicks.\n\nFinally, we find out how many boxes of toothpicks were used. Since each box contains 450 toothpicks, we divide the total number of toothpicks by the number of toothpicks per box:\n\\[ \\frac{2700}{450} = 6 \\]\nSo, Eugene used 6 boxes of toothpicks.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",

Since each card requires 75 toothpicks, we multiply the number of cards used by the number of toothpicks per card:\n\\[ 36 \\times 75 = 2700 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many boxes of toothpicks were used. Since each box contains 450 toothpicks, we divide the total number of toothpicks used by the number of toothpicks per box:\n\\[ \\frac{2700}{450} = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, Eugene used \\(\\boxed{6}\\) boxes of toothpicks to create his model house.",
        "To determine how many boxes of toothpicks Eugene used to create his model house, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of cards Eugene used:**\n   Eugene had a deck of 52 cards and used all but 16 of them.\n   \\[\n   52 - 16 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, Eugene used 36 cards.\n\n2. **Determine the total number of toothpicks used:**\n   Each card requires 75 toothpicks.

Therefore, the number of cards he used is:\n\\[ 52 - 16 = 36 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of toothpicks used. Since Eugene used 75 toothpicks for each card, the total number of toothpicks is:\n\\[ 36 \\times 75 = 2700 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many boxes of toothpicks Eugene used. Since each box contains 450 toothpicks, the number of boxes is:\n\\[ \\frac{2700}{450} = 6 \\]\n\nThus, the number of boxes of toothpicks Eugene used to create his model house is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",
