        "To determine the total number of swordfish Shelly and Sam catch, we need to calculate the number of swordfish each of them catches per fishing trip and then sum these amounts over the 5 trips.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many swordfish Shelly catches each time they go fishing. According to the problem, Shelly catches 2 less than five swordfish. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \\]\nSo, Shelly catches 3 swordfish each time they go fishing.\n\nNext, let's find out how many swordfish Sam catches each time they go fishing. The problem states that Sam catches one less swordfish than Shelly. Since Shelly catches 3 swordfish each time, Sam catches:\n\\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \\]\nSo, Sam catches 2 swordfish each time they go fishing.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of swordfish Shelly catches over 5 trips. Since she catches 3 swordfish each time, over 5 trips she catches:\n\\[ 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\nSo, Shelly catches 15 swordfish in total.\n\nSimilarly, we need to calculate the total number of swordfish Sam catches over 5 trips. Since he catches 2 swordfish each time, over 5 trips he catches:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\nSo, Sam catches 10 swordfish in total.\n\nTo find the total number of swordfish caught by both Shelly and Sam, we add the number of swordfish each of them caught:\n\\[ 15 + 10 = 25 \\]\nSo, the total number of swordfish they catch in total is:\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]",
