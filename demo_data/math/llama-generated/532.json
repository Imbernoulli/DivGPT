        "To determine how many more liters of oil are needed to make the large tanker half-full, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of oil poured from the 4000-liter tank into the 20000-liter tanker.\n2. Determine the total amount of oil in the 20000-liter tanker after the oil is poured.\n3. Calculate half of the capacity of the 20000-liter tanker.\n4. Find out how many more liters of oil are needed to reach half-full.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The 4000-liter tank was initially full, and three-quarters of the oil was poured into the 20000-liter tanker.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount of oil poured} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 4000 = 3000 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\n2. The 20000-liter tanker already had 3000 liters of oil. After pouring the oil from the 4000-liter tank, the total amount of oil in the 20000-liter tanker is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total oil in the tanker} = 3000 + 3000 = 6000 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\n3.

To find out how many more liters of oil are needed to make the large tanker half-full, we subtract the current amount of oil from the half-full capacity:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ QStringListargest oil needed} = 10000 - 6000 = 4000 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of more liters of oil needed to make the large tanker half-full is \\(\\boxed{4000}\\).",

Three-quarters of the oil from the 4000-liter tank was poured into the 20000-liter tanker. So, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 4000 = 3000 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the oil poured to the oil already in the 20000-liter tanker. The tanker initially had 3000 liters of oil, so:\n\\[\n3000 + 3000 = 6000 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how much oil is required to make the 20000-liter tanker half-full. Half of 20000 liters is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 20000 = 10000 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the amount of oil currently in the tanker from the amount needed to make it half-full:\n\\[\n10000 - 6000 = 4000 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of more liters of oil needed to make the large tanker half-full is \\boxed{4000}.",

Therefore, the amount of oil needed to make it half-full is:\n\\[\n\\text{Oil needed} = 10000 - 6000 = 4000 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of more liters of oil needed to make the large tanker half-full is \\boxed{4000}.",

This is calculated by subtracting the current amount of oil from the half-full capacity:\n\\[\n10000 - 6000 = 4000 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of more liters of oil needed to make the large tanker half-full is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4000}\n\\]",
