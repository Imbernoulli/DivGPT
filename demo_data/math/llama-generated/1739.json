        "Let's denote the number of cars Derek had when he was 6 years old as \\( c \\). According to the problem, when Derek was 6 years old, he had three times as many dogs as cars. Since we know he had 90 dogs when he was 6 years old, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 90 = 3c \\]\nSolving for \\( c \\), we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ c = 30 \\]\nSo, Derek had 30 cars when he was 6 years old.\n\nTen years later, Derek is 16 years old.

        "Let's denote the number of cars Derek had when he was six years old as \\( c \\). According to the problem, when Derek was six years old, he had three times as many dogs as cars. Since we know he had 90 dogs at that time, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n3c = 90\n\\]\nSolving for \\( c \\), we get:\n\\[\nc = \\frac{90}{3} = 30\n\\]\nSo, Derek had 30 cars when he was six years old.\n\nTen years later, Derek is 16 years old. Let's denote the number of dogs Derek had when he was 16 years old as \\( d \\) and the number of cars he had when he was 16 years old as \\( c' \\). According to the problem, ten years later, Derek sold some of his dogs and bought 210 more cars, so the number of cars he had now is:\n\\[\nc' = 30 + 210 = 240\n\\]\nThe problem also states that at this point, the number of cars became twice the number of dogs, so we can write the equation:\n\\[\nc' = 2d\n\\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( c' \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n240 = 2d\n\\]\nSolving for \\( d \\), we get:\n\\[\nd = \\frac{240}{2} = 120\n\\]\nSo, Derek has 120 dogs now. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]",
        "Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.\n\nWhen Derek was 6 years old, he had 90 dogs and three times as many dogs as cars.
