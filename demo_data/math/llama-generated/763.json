        "To determine how much change Lucas brings home, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the avocados.\n2. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Lucas had.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the avocados. Lucas is buying 3 avocados, and each avocado costs $2. So, we multiply the number of avocados by the cost per avocado:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ avocados} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per avocado} = \\$6 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost of the avocados from the amount of money Lucas had. Lucas started with $20. So, we subtract $6 from $20:\n\\[ \\$20 - \\$6 = \\$14 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of change Lucas brings home is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
