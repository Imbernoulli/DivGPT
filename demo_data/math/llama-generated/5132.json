Multiply the remaining time by the rate at which Andrew stamps permit applications to find the total number of permits he stamps.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Andrew has 2 appointments, each lasting 3 hours.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   So, Andrew spends 6 hours on his appointments.\n\n2. Andrew's total workday is 8 hours.

Andrew's workday is 8 hours long, so we subtract the 6 hours spent on appointments from 8 hours:\n\\[ 8 - 6 = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we multiply the time spent stamping permit applications by his stamping rate to find the total number of permits stamped. Andrew can stamp 50 permit applications per hour, so we multiply 2 hours by 50 permit applications per hour:\n\\[ 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\text{ permits} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of permits Andrew stamps today is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
