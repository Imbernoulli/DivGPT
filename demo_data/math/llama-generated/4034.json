        "Let's start by determining the number of books Evan currently owns. We know that Evan own 40 fewer books than the number he had 2 years ago. Since Evan had 200 books two years ago, we can calculate the number of books he currently owns as follows:\n\n\\[ 200 - 40 = 160 \\]\n\nSo, Evan currently owns 160 books.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many books Evan will have in five years. According to the problem, in five years, Evan will have 60 more than five times as many books as he owns now. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 160 + 60 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate five times 160:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 160 = 800 \\]\n\nThen, we add 60 to 800:\n\n\\[ 800 + 60 = 860 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of books Evan will have in five years is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{860} \\]",
