Add the cost of the soccer shoes to the cost of the socks:\n   \\[\n   19.00 + 92.00 = 111.00\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract the amount of money Jack has from the total cost to find out how much more he needs:\n   \\[\n   111.00 - 40.00 = 71.00\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jack needs \\(\\boxed{71}\\) more dollars.",
