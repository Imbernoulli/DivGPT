So, we multiply the number of packs per brown box by the number of brown boxes:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ packs/box} \\times 8 \\text{ boxes} = 160 \\text{ packs}\n   \\]\n\n4. Each pack contains 3 sticks of gum. Therefore, the total number of sticks of gum in 160 packs is:\n   \\[\n   160 \\text{ packs} \\times 3 \\text{ sticks/pack} = 480 \\text{ sticks}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of sticks of gum in 8 brown boxes is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",
