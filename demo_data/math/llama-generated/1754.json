        "To determine how many fish Julio has by the 9th hour after losing some fish, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of fish Julio catches in 9 hours.\n2. Subtract the number of fish he loses from the total number of fish caught.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of fish Julio catches in 9 hours. Since he catches 7 fish every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the number of fish caught per hour:\n\\[\n7 \\text{ fish/hour} \\times 9 \\text{ hours} = 63 \\text{ fish}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of fish he loses from the total number of fish caught. Julio loses 15 fish, so we subtract 15 from 63:\n\\[\n63 \\text{ fish} - 15 \\text{ fish} = 48 \\text{ fish}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, by the 9th hour, Julio has \\boxed{48} fish.",
