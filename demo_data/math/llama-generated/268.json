        "To determine the total cost of 3 kilograms of chicken and 1 kilogram of pork, we start by finding the cost of each type of meat per kilogram.\n\nFirst, we know the cost of a kilogram of pork is $6. The cost of a kilogram of chicken is $2 less than the cost of a kilogram of pork. Therefore, we calculate the cost of a kilogram of chicken as follows:\n\\[\n6 - 2 = 4\n\\]\nSo, a kilogram of chicken costs $4.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of 3 kilograms of chicken. Since each kilogram of chicken costs $4, the cost for 3 kilograms is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 4 = 12\n\\]\nSo, 3 kilograms of chicken cost $12.\n\nNow, we add the cost of 1 kilogram of pork to the cost of 3 kilograms of chicken to find the total cost:\n\\[\n12 + 6 = 18\n\\]\nTherefore, the total cost of 3 kilograms of chicken and 1 kilogram of pork is \\boxed{18}.",
