        "To determine the total cost of the shots, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of puppies born.\n2. Determine the total number of shots needed.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the shots.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many puppies are born in total. Chuck has 3 pregnant dogs, and each dog gives birth to 4 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many shots are needed in total. Each puppy needs 2 shots, so the total number of shots is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 2 = 24 \\]\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the total cost of the shots. Each shot costs $5, so the total cost is:\n\\[ 24 \\times 5 = 120 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the shots is:\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]",
