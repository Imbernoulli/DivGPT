        "To determine the total amount Isabela spent on cucumbers and pencils, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pencils Isabela bought.\n2. Determine the cost of the pencils after the discount.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the cucumbers.\n4. Add the cost of the pencils and the cost of the cucumbers to find the total amount spent.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Isabela bought twice as many cucumbers as pencils. Since she bought 100 cucumbers, we can find the number of pencils by dividing the number of cucumbers by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pencils} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the pencils after the discount. The original price of each pencil is $20, and she received a 20% discount. Therefore, the discount amount per pencil is:\n\\[\n\\text{Discount per pencil} = 20 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 20 \\times 0.20 = 4\n\\]\nThe price of each pencil after the discount is:\n\\[\n\\text{Price per pencil after discount} = 20 - 4 = 16\n\\]\nThe total cost for all the pencils is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of pencils} = 50 \\times 16 = 800\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of the cucumbers. The original price of each cucumber is $20, and she bought 100 cucumbers. Therefore, the total cost for the cucumbers is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of cucumbers} = 100 \\times 20 = 2000\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the total cost of the pencils and the total cost of the cucumbers to find the total amount Isabela spent:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount spent} = 800 + 2000 = 2800\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount Isabela spent to buy the items is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2800}\n\\]",

Since she bought 100 cucumbers, the number of pencils she bought is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of pencils} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\]\n\nNext, let's determine the cost of the pencils after the discount. The original cost of each pencil is $20, and she received a 20% discount. Therefore, the discount amount per pencil is:\n\\[ \\text{Discount per pencil} = 20 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 20 \\times 0.20 = 4 \\]\nSo, the cost of each pencil after the discount is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost per pencil after discount} = 20 - 4 = 16 \\]\nThe total cost for 50 pencils is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost of pencils} = 50 \\times 16 = 800 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the cucumbers. The original cost of each cucumber is $20, and she bought 100 cucumbers. Therefore, the total cost of the cucumbers is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost of cucumbers} = 100 \\times 20 = 2000 \\]\n\nFinally, let's add the cost of the pencils and the cost of the cucumbers to get the total amount Isabela spent:\n\\[ \\text{Total amount spent} = 800 + 2000 = 2800 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Isabela spent to buy the items is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2800} \\]",
