Her mother gave her an additional $4, and her father gave her twice as much as her mother. Therefore, her father gave her \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) dollars.\n\nAdding these amounts together, we get:\n\\[ 10 + 4 + 8 = 22 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost of the candies and jelly beans.**\n\nOne candy costs $0.5, and Sandra wants to buy 14 candies. Therefore, the cost of the candies is:\n\\[ 14 \\times 0.5 = 7 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nOne jelly bean costs $0.2, and Sandra wants to buy 20 jelly beans. Therefore, the cost of the jelly beans is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 0.2 = 4 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the cost of the candies and jelly beans together, we get:\n\\[ 7 + 4 = 11 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the total amount of money Sandra has.**\n\nSandra has $22 and the total cost of the candies and jelly beans is $11. Therefore, the amount of money she will be left with is:\n\\[ 22 - 11 = 11 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Sandra will be left with after the purchase is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
