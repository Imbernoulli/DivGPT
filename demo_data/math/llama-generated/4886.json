        "To determine how many pills John takes in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how many times John takes a pill in one day.\n2. Multiply the number of pills taken in one day by the number of days in a week.\n\nFirst, we know that John takes a pill every 6 hours. There are 24 hours in a day. So, we divide 24 by 6 to find out how many pills he takes in one day:\n\\[\n24 \\div 6 = 4\n\\]\nThis means John takes 4 pills in one day.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pills he takes in a week. There are 7 days in a week. So, we multiply the number of pills taken in one day by 7:\n\\[\n4 \\times 7 = 28\n\\]\nTherefore, John takes \\boxed{28} pills in a week.",
