        "To determine the floor on which Dennis lives, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Frank's floor number.\n2. Calculate Charlie's floor number based on the relationship between Charlie's and Frank's floor numbers.\n3. Determine Dennis's floor number based on the relationship between Dennis's and Charlie's floor numbers.\n\nFirst, we know that Frank lives on the 16th floor. According to the problem, Charlie lives on a floor whose number is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of Frank's floor number. Therefore, we calculate Charlie's floor number as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Charlie's floor number} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Dennis lives two floors above Charlie. Therefore, we calculate Dennis's floor number as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Dennis's floor number} = \\text{Charlie's floor number} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, Dennis lives on the \\(\\boxed{6}\\)th floor."
