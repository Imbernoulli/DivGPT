        "To determine the total earnings of the 5th graders over the three days, we need to calculate their earnings for each day and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much they earned on Saturday. According to the problem, their earnings on Saturday were $7 more than twice their Friday earnings. Since they earned $147 on Friday, we can calculate their Saturday earnings as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 147 + 7 = 294 + 7 = 301\n\\]\nSo, they earned $301 on Saturday.\n\nNext, let's find out how much they earned on Sunday.

Since they earned $147 on Friday, we can calculate their Sunday earnings as follows:\n\\[\n147 + 78 = 225\n\\]\nSo, they earned $225 on Sunday.\n\nNow, we sum the earnings from all three days to find the total earnings:\n\\[\n147 + 301 + 225 = 673\n\\]\nTherefore, the total earnings over the three days is \\boxed{673}.",
