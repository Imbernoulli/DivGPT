        "To determine the total number of calories Zoe consumed, we need to calculate the calories from the strawberries and the calories from the yogurt separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the calories from the strawberries:\n- Zoe ate 12 strawberries.\n- Each strawberry has 4 calories.\n- Therefore, the total calories from the strawberries is \\(12 \\times 4 = 48\\) calories.\n\nNext, we calculate the calories from the yogurt:\n- Zoe ate 6 ounces of yogurt.\n- Each ounce of yogurt has 17 calories.\n- Therefore, the total calories from the yogurt is \\(6 \\times 17 = 102\\) calories.\n\nNow, we add the calories from the strawberries and the calories from the yogurt to find the total calories consumed:\n- The total calories consumed is \\(48 + 102 = 150\\).\n\nThus, the total number of calories Zoe ate is \\(\\boxed{150}\\).",
