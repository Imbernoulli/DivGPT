        "To determine how many portions of 200 ml milk Jasmine can pour from a full 2-liter container, we first need to convert the volume of the container from liters to milliliters. Since 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, a 2-liter container is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\text{ liters} = 2 \\times 1000 \\text{ ml} = 2000 \\text{ ml} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many 200 ml portions can be poured from 2000 ml.
