        "To determine the total number of chips Viviana and Susana have together, we need to find out how many chocolate chips and vanilla chips each person has.\n\nFirst, we know that Viviana has 20 vanilla chips. According to the problem, Susana has \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) as many vanilla chips as Viviana. Therefore, we calculate the number of vanilla chips Susana has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Vanilla chips Susana has} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 20 = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana. Since Susana has 25 chocolate chips, we calculate the number of chocolate chips Viviana has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Chocolate chips Viviana has} = 25 + 5 = 30\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum up all the chips Viviana and Susana have:\n\\[\n\\text{Total chips} = (\\text{Vanilla chips Viviana has} + \\text{Chocolate chips Viviana has}) + (\\text{Vanilla chips Susana has} + \\text{Chocolate chips Susana has})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total chips} = (20 + 30) + (15 + 25) = 50 + 40 = 90\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of chips they have together is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).",
