Calculate the total number of supplies left.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of construction paper needed.**\nKelly has 8 students, and each student needs 3 pieces of construction paper.\n\\[ 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\]\nSo, she needs 24 pieces of construction paper.\n\n**Step 2: Add the number of bottles of glue.**\nKelly needs 6 bottles of glue.\n\\[ 24 + 6 = 30 \\]\nSo, she needs a total of 30 supplies.\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many supplies were lost.**\nKelly dropped half of the supplies down a storm drain.\n\\[ \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\]\nSo, she lost 15 supplies.\n\n**Step 4: Add the additional pieces of construction paper Kelly bought.**\nKelly bought 5 more pieces of construction paper.\n\\[ 30 - 15 + 5 = 20 \\]\nSo, she has 20 supplies left.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",
        "First, we calculate the total number of pieces of construction paper Kelly initially needs. Since there are 8 students and each student needs 3 pieces, we multiply:\n\n\\[ 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\text{ pieces of construction paper} \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of bottles of glue she needs:\n\n\\[ 24 \\text{ pieces of construction paper} + 6 \\text{ bottles of glue} = 30 \\text{ supplies} \\]\n\nAfter dropping half of the supplies down a storm drain, she has:\n\n\\[ \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\text{ supplies} \\]\n\nThen, she buys 5 more pieces of construction paper. So, we add these 5 pieces to the 15 supplies she has left:\n\n\\[ 15 + 5 = 20 \\text{ supplies} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of supplies left is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
