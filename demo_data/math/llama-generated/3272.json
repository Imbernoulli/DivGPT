Calculate the total amount spent on the skirts.\n3. Determine the cost of each skirt.\n\nFirst, we know the total amount Emily spent is $50. She spent $20 on art supplies. Therefore, the amount spent on the skirts is:\n\\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \\]\n\nNext, we know Emily bought 2 skirts that cost the same amount of money.
