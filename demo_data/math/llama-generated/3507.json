        "To determine how many of Mr. Sanchez's Grade 5 students got a final grade of B and above, we start by calculating the number of students who got a final grade below B.\n\nFirst, we find 40% of the total number of students. Since Mr. Sanchez has 60 students, we calculate:\n\\[ 40\\% \\text{ of } 60 = 0.40 \\times 60 = 24 \\]\n\nThis means that 24 students got a final grade below B. To find out how many students got a final grade of B and above, we subtract the number of students who got a final grade below B from the total number of students:\n\\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students who got a final grade of B and above is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
        "To determine how many of Mr. Sanchez's Grade 5 students got a final grade of B and above, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of students who got a final grade below B:**\n   - We know that 40% of the students got a final grade below B.\n   - Mr. Sanchez has 60 students in total.\n   - Therefore, the number of students who got a final grade below B is:\n     \\[\n     0.40 \\times 60 = 24\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of students who got a final grade of B and above:**\n   - Since there are 60 students in total and 24 of them got a final grade below B, the number of students who got a final grade of B and above is:\n     \\[\n     60 - 24 = 36\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of students who got a final grade of B and above is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
