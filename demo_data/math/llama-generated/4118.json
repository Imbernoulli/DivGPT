        "To determine how many pieces of chalk Erika and her siblings originally had, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of people drawing:**\n   - Erika and her 3 siblings make 4 people.\n   - Another 3 friends join them.\n   - Total number of people = \\( 4 + 3 = 7 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the total number of pieces of chalk needed for everyone to have 3 pieces each:**\n   - Each person gets 3 pieces of chalk.\n   - Total pieces needed = \\( 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\).\n\n3. **Account for the additional pieces of chalk brought out by Erika’s mom:**\n   - Erika’s mom brings out 12 pieces of chalk.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of pieces of chalk Erika and her siblings originally had.\n   - After losing 2 pieces, they had \\( x - 2 \\) pieces.\n   - With the 12 pieces added, they now have \\( (x - 2) + 12 = x + 10 \\) pieces.\n\n4. **Set up the equation based on the total pieces of chalk needed:**\n   - The total number of pieces of chalk they now have is equal to the total number of pieces needed.\n   - \\( x + 10 = 21 \\).\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - \\( x + 10 = 21 \\)\n   - Subtract 10 from both sides: \\( x = 21 - 10 \\)\n   - \\( x = 11 \\)\n\nTherefore, Erika and her siblings originally had \\(\\boxed{11}\\) pieces of chalk.",

When 3 more friends join them, the total number of people becomes:\n\n\\[4 + 3 = 7\\]\n\nAfter Erika loses 2 pieces of chalk, the number of pieces of chalk they have left is unknown. Let's call the original number of pieces of chalk \\(x\\). After losing 2 pieces, they have \\(x - 2\\) pieces of chalk. Erika's mom brings out another 12 pieces of chalk, so the total number of pieces of chalk now is:\n\n\\[x - 2 + 12 = x + 10\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, there is now enough chalk for everyone to have 3 pieces each. Since there are 7 people, the total number of pieces of chalk needed is:\n\n\\[7 \\times 3 = 21\\]\n\nTherefore, we can set up the following equation to find \\(x\\):\n\n\\[x + 10 = 21\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[x = 21 - 10\\]\n\\[x = 11\\]\n\nSo, the original number of pieces of chalk that Erika and her siblings had is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{11}\\]",
        "To determine how many pieces of chalk Erika and her siblings originally had, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of people drawing:**\n   - Erika and her 3 siblings make \\(1 + 3 = 4\\) people.\n   - Another 3 friends join them, so the total number of people is \\(4 + 3 = 7\\).\n\n2. **Determine the total number of pieces of chalk needed:**\n   - Each person needs 3 pieces of chalk.\n   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of chalk needed is \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\).\n\n3. **Account for the additional chalk brought by Erika's mom:**\n   - Erika’s mom brings out 12 pieces of chalk.\n   - After losing 2 pieces, Erika and her siblings had \\(x - 2\\) pieces of chalk initially.\n   - Adding the 12 pieces of chalk brings the total to \\(x - 2 + 12 = x + 10\\).\n\n4. **Set up the equation:**\n   - The total number of pieces of chalk after Erika's mom brings out the chalk is equal to the total number needed.\n   - Therefore, \\(x + 10 = 21\\).\n\n5. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   x + 10 = 21\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 21 - 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 11\n   \\]\n\nSo, Erika and her siblings originally had \\(\\boxed{11}\\) pieces of chalk.",
