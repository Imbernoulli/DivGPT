        "To determine the total number of chocolates Kantana bought for the month, we need to break down her purchases week by week and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of chocolates Kantana buys for herself and her sister each week. She buys 2 chocolates for herself and 1 chocolate for her sister, so each week she buys:\n\\[2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ chocolates}\\]\n\nSince there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of chocolates she buys for herself and her sister over the month is:\n\\[3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ chocolates}\\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the additional 10 chocolates she bought as a birthday gift for her friend Charlie. Adding these to the total from the previous calculation, we get:\n\\[12 + 10 = 22 \\text{ chocolates}\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of chocolates Kantana ended up buying for the month is:\n\\[\\boxed{22}\\]"
