        "To determine Milford's current age and his age in 3 years, we start by finding Eustace's current age. We know that in 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old. Therefore, we can calculate Eustace's current age as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Eustace's current age} = 39 - 3 = 36 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Eustace is twice as old as Milford. Therefore, we can express Milford's current age in terms of Eustace's current age:\n\n\\[ \\text{Milford's current age} = \\frac{\\text{Eustace's current age}}{2} = \\frac{36}{2} = 18 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how old Milford will be in 3 years. We do this by adding 3 to Milford's current age:\n\n\\[ \\text{Milford's age in 3 years} = 18 + 3 = 21 \\]\n\nThus, Milford will be \\boxed{21} years old.",
        "To determine Milford's current age and future age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Eustace's current age.\n2. Use Eustace's current age to find Milford's current age.\n3. Calculate Milford's age in 3 years.\n\nFirst, we know that in 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old. Therefore, his current age is:\n\\[ 39 - 3 = 36 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Eustace is twice as old as Milford. So, if Eustace's current age is 36, then Milford's current age is:\n\\[ \\frac{36}{2} = 18 \\]\n\nIn 3 years, Milford's age will be:\n\\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \\]\n\nThus, Milford will be \\(\\boxed{21}\\) years old.",

Therefore, his current age is:\n\n\\[ 39 - 3 = 36 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Eustace is twice as old as Milford. Let's denote Milford's current age as \\( M \\). Since Eustace is twice as old as Milford, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 2M = 36 \\]\n\nTo find Milford's current age, we solve for \\( M \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{36}{2} = 18 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine Milford's age in 3 years. Since Milford is currently 18 years old, in 3 years he will be:\n\n\\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \\]\n\nTherefore, Milford will be \\(\\boxed{21}\\) years old."
