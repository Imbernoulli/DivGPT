        "First, we determine the total number of pencils Steve initially has. Since he has 2 boxes of pencils with 12 pencils in each box, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nSo, Steve starts with 24 pencils.\n\nNext, we find out how many pencils Steve gave to Matt. According to the problem, Steve gave Matt 3 more pencils than he gave to Lauren. Since Steve gave Lauren 6 pencils, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \\]\n\nSo, Steve gave Matt 9 pencils.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of pencils Steve gave away. This is the sum of the pencils he gave to Lauren and the pencils he gave to Matt:\n\n\\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \\]\n\nFinally, we determine how many pencils Steve has left by subtracting the total number of pencils he gave away from the total number of pencils he initially had:\n\n\\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \\]\n\nSo, the number of pencils Steve has left is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
