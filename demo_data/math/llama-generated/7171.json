        "To determine the percentage of bottle caps that are green, we first need to find out how many green caps Ali has. We know that the total number of bottle caps is 125 and that the number of red caps is 50. Therefore, the number of green caps can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of green caps} = \\text{Total number of bottle caps} - \\text{Number of red caps} = 125 - 50 = 75\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out what percentage 75 is of the total 125 bottle caps. The percentage can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage of green caps} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of green caps}}{\\text{Total number of bottle caps}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage of green caps} = \\left( \\frac{75}{125} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction \\(\\frac{75}{125}\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{75}{125} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of green caps is:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right) \\times 100 = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, the percentage of caps that are green is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
