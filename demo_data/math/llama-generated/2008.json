        "To determine how old Mark will be in 5 years, we first need to find out Mark's current age. We know from the problem statement that Mark is 7 years older than Amy. Since Amy is currently 15 years old, we can calculate Mark's current age as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mark's current age} = \\text{Amy's current age} + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22 \\]\n\nNow that we know Mark is currently 22 years old, we need to find out how old he will be in 5 years. We do this by adding 5 years to his current age:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mark's age in 5 years} = \\text{Mark's current age} + 5 = 22 + 5 = 27 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mark will be \\(\\boxed{27}\\) years old in 5 years.",
