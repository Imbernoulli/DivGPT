Since ten people each donate five books:\n\\[ \\text{Total books donated} = 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\]\n\nNow, we add the weekly donations to the initial number of books:\n\\[ \\text{Total books after donations} = 300 + 50 = 350 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of books borrowed from the total after donations:\n\\[ \\text{Total books remaining} = 350 - 140 = 210 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of books Tracy has remaining in the store is:\n\\[ \\boxed{210} \\]",
