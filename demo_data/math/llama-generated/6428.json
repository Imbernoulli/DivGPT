        "To determine the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the cost of the gum and the candy bars separately and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we find the cost of one stick of gum.

Since each pack of gum contains 1 stick and each stick costs $0.75, the total cost for the gum is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.75 = 1.50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total cost of the 3 candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $1.50, the total cost for the candy bars is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 1.50 = 4.50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total cost of the gum and the total cost of the candy bars to find the total amount John paid:\n\\[ 1.50 + 4.50 = 6.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount John paid is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",
