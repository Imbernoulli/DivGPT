Add the increase to the current annual consumption to find the total annual consumption after the increase.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the current annual consumption of grapes. Borris uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. Therefore, in one year (which has two 6-month periods), he uses:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ kg} \\times 2 = 180 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many additional kilograms of grapes Borris will use after increasing his production by twenty percent. A twenty percent increase in the annual consumption is:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ kg} \\times 0.20 = 36 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nNow, we add this increase to the current annual consumption to find the total annual consumption after the increase:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ kg} + 36 \\text{ kg} = 216 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of grapes Borris needs in a year after increasing his production is:\n\\[ \\boxed{216} \\]",
