        "To determine how many fish remain after the boat tipped over, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of fish Perry caught.\n2. Find the total number of fish caught by Jordan and Perry.\n3. Determine how many fish were lost when the boat tipped over.\n4. Subtract the number of lost fish from the total number of fish caught.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of fish Perry caught. Jordan caught 4 fish, and Perry caught double what Jordan caught:\n\\[\n\\text{Fish caught by Perry} = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of fish caught by Jordan and Perry:\n\\[\n\\text{Total fish caught} = \\text{Fish caught by Jordan} + \\text{Fish caught by Perry} = 4 + 8 = 12\n\\]\n\nThen, we determine how many fish were lost when the boat tipped over. They lost one-fourth of their total catch:\n\\[\n\\text{Fish lost} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of lost fish from the total number of fish caught:\n\\[\n\\text{Fish remaining} = \\text{Total fish caught} - \\text{Fish lost} = 12 - 3 = 9\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of fish that remain is \\boxed{9}.",

Since Perry caught double what Jordan caught, we can calculate the number of fish Perry caught as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fish Perry caught} = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of fish caught by adding the number of fish Jordan caught to the number of fish Perry caught:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of fish caught} = 4 + 8 = 12\n\\]\n\nWhen the boat tipped over, they lost one-fourth of their total catch. To find out how many fish were lost, we calculate one-fourth of 12:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fish lost} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of fish remaining by subtracting the number of fish lost from the total number of fish caught:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fish remaining} = 12 - 3 = 9\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of fish that remain is \\boxed{9}.",
