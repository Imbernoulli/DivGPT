        "To determine the total number of birds the cat catches, we need to consider the number of birds it catches during the day and the number it catches at night. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The cat catches 8 birds during the day.\n2. At night, the cat catches twice as many birds as it does during the day. Therefore, the number of birds caught at night is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 8 = 16\n   \\]\n3. To find the total number of birds caught, we add the number of birds caught during the day to the number of birds caught at night:\n   \\[\n   8 + 16 = 24\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of birds the cat catches is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
