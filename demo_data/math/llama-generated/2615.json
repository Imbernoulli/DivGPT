Therefore, the number of seeds in bucket A is:\n\\[ 30 + 10 = 40 \\]\n\nStep 3: Use the total number of seeds in all three buckets to find the number of seeds in bucket C.\nWe are given that the total number of seeds in all three buckets is 100. Let \\( C \\) represent the number of seeds in bucket C. Then we can write the equation:\n\\[ A + B + C = 100 \\]\nSubstituting the values we found for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 40 + 30 + C = 100 \\]\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 70 + C = 100 \\]\nTo find \\( C \\), we subtract 70 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ C = 100 - 70 = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of seeds in bucket C is \\(\\boxed{30}\\)."
