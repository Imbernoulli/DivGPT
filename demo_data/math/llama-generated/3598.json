Zachary sold 40 games at $5 each, so the total amount he received is:\n\\[\n40 \\times 5 = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how much Jason received. Jason received 30% more money than Zachary. Therefore, we calculate 30% of $200 and add it to $200:\n\\[\n0.30 \\times 200 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\\[\n200 + 60 = 260 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate how much Ryan received. Ryan received $50 more than Jason. Therefore, we add $50 to $260:\n\\[\n260 + 50 = 310 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the total amount of money the three friends received together by adding the amounts each friend received:\n\\[\n200 + 260 + 310 = 770 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money the three friends received together is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{770}\n\\]"
