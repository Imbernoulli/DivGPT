        "Let's define the number of gallons of water Roman used as \\( x \\). According to the problem, Remy used 1 more gallon than 3 times the number of gallons that Roman used. Therefore, we can express the number of gallons Remy used as \\( 3x + 1 \\).\n\nThe total amount of water used by both Roman and Remy is 33 gallons. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ x + (3x + 1) = 33 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 4x + 1 = 33 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 4x = 32 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 4:\n\\[ x = 8 \\]\n\nSo, Roman used 8 gallons of water. To find out how many gallons Remy used, we substitute \\( x = 8 \\) back into the expression for the number of gallons Remy used:\n\\[ 3x + 1 = 3(8) + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 \\]\n\nTherefore, Remy used \\(\\boxed{25}\\) gallons of water.",
