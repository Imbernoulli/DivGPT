Calculate the height the second rocket can travel.\n3. Add the heights of the two rockets together.\n\nFirst, we know that the first rocket can travel 500 feet in the air. So, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Height of the first rocket} = 500 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how high the second rocket can travel. The problem states that the second rocket can travel twice as high as the first rocket. Therefore, we multiply the height of the first rocket by 2:\n\\[ \\text{Height of the second rocket} = 2 \\times 500 \\text{ feet} = 1000 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNow, we add the heights of the two rockets together to find the combined height:\n\\[ \\text{Combined height} = 500 \\text{ feet} + 1000 \\text{ feet} = 1500 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nThus, the combined height of the two rockets is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1500} \\]",
