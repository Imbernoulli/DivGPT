        "To determine the total length of Tim's movie marathon, we need to calculate the duration of each movie and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First Movie:**\n   The first movie is 2 hours long.\n\n2. **Second Movie:**\n   The second movie is 50% longer than the first movie. To find 50% of 2 hours:\n   \\[\n   0.5 \\times 2 = 1 \\text{ hour}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the second movie is:\n   \\[\n   2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Movie:**\n   The third movie is 1 hour shorter than the combined time of the first and second movies.

The duration of the first movie is given as 2 hours.\n2. The duration of the second movie is 50% longer than the first movie. Since the first movie is 2 hours long, the second movie is:\n   \\[\n   2 + 0.5 \\times 2 = 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n3. The duration of the third movie is 1 hour shorter than the combined time of the first and second movies. The combined time of the first and second movies is:\n   \\[\n   2 + 3 = 5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the duration of the third movie is:\n   \\[\n   5 - 1 = 4 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the durations of all three movies to find the total length of the movie marathon:\n\\[\n2 + 3 + 4 = 9 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total length of Tim's movie marathon is \\(\\boxed{9}\\) hours.",
        "To determine the total length of Tim's movie marathon, we need to calculate the duration of each movie and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First Movie:**\n   The first movie is 2 hours long.\n\n2. **Second Movie:**\n   The second movie is 50% longer than the first movie.
