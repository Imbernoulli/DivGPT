According to the problem, the relationship between the number of lattes and teas can be expressed as:\n\\[ L = 4T + 8 \\]\n\nNext, we substitute the given value of \\( T \\) into the equation:\n\\[ L = 4(6) + 8 \\]\n\nWe then perform the multiplication:\n\\[ L = 24 + 8 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the numbers together:\n\\[ L = 32 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of lattes sold by the coffee shop is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
