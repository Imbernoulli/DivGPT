        "To determine the total number of eyes among Nina's pet insects, we need to calculate the number of eyes for the spiders and the ants separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of eyes for the spiders. Since each spider has 8 eyes and Nina has 3 spiders, we multiply the number of spiders by the number of eyes per spider:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ spiders} \\times 8 \\text{ eyes per spider} = 24 \\text{ eyes} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of eyes for the ants. Since each ant has 2 eyes and Nina has 50 ants, we multiply the number of ants by the number of eyes per ant:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ ants} \\times 2 \\text{ eyes per ant} = 100 \\text{ eyes} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of eyes from the spiders and the ants to get the total number of eyes:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ eyes} + 100 \\text{ eyes} = 124 \\text{ eyes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of eyes among Nina's pet insects is \\(\\boxed{124}\\).",
