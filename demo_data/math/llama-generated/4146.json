        "To determine the total number of matches Sam won, we need to calculate the number of matches he won in his first 100 matches and then add that to the number of matches he won in his next 100 matches.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of matches Sam won in his first 100 matches. Since he won 50% of his first 100 matches, we can find this by multiplying 100 by 50% (or 0.50):\n\n\\[\n100 \\times 0.50 = 50\n\\]\n\nSo, Sam won 50 matches in his first 100 matches.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of matches Sam won in his next 100 matches. Since he won 60% of his next 100 matches, we can find this by multiplying 100 by 60% (or 0.60):\n\n\\[\n100 \\times 0.60 = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, Sam won 60 matches in his next 100 matches.\n\nTo find the total number of matches Sam won, we add the number of matches he won in his first 100 matches to the number of matches he won in his next 100 matches:\n\n\\[\n50 + 60 = 110\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of matches Sam won is \\boxed{110}.",
        "To determine the total number of matches Sam won, we need to calculate the number of matches he won in his first 100 matches and in his next 100 matches separately, and then sum these two amounts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of matches Sam won in his first 100 matches. Since he won 50% of these matches, we multiply 100 by 0.50:\n\\[\n100 \\times 0.50 = 50\n\\]\nSo, Sam won 50 matches in his first 100 matches.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of matches Sam won in his next 100 matches. Since he won 60% of these matches, we multiply 100 by 0.60:\n\\[\n100 \\times 0.60 = 60\n\\]\nSo, Sam won 60 matches in his next 100 matches.\n\nTo find the total number of matches Sam won, we add the number of matches he won in his first 100 matches to the number of matches he won in his next 100 matches:\n\\[\n50 + 60 = 110\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of matches Sam won is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",
