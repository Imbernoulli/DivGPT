        "To determine how many cups of lemonade Alexa needs to sell to make a profit of $80, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total revenue required to achieve the profit.\n2. Determine the number of cups of lemonade that need to be sold to generate that revenue.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total revenue required. Alexa wants to make a profit of $80, and she has already spent $20 on ingredients. Therefore, the total revenue needed is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Revenue} = \\text{Profit} + \\text{Cost of Ingredients} = 80 + 20 = 100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many cups of lemonade she needs to sell to generate $100 in revenue. Since each cup of lemonade is sold for $2, the number of cups required is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Cups} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Price per Cup}} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\]\n\nSo, Alexa needs to sell \\(\\boxed{50}\\) cups of lemonade to make a profit of $80.",

Identify the total revenue required to make a profit of $80 after spending $20 on ingredients.\n2. Calculate the number of cups of lemonade needed to generate that total revenue.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the total revenue required.**\n\nAlexa's profit is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Cost} \\]\n\nWe know the profit is $80 and the total cost of ingredients is $20.

        "To determine how many cups of lemonade Alexa needs to sell to make a profit of $80, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the profit equation. Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost. The total revenue is the price per cup of lemonade multiplied by the number of cups sold, and the total cost is the amount spent on ingredients.\n2. Let \\( x \\) be the number of cups of lemonade Alexa needs to sell. The revenue from selling \\( x \\) cups of lemonade is \\( 2x \\) dollars (since each cup is sold for $2).\n3. The total cost is $20 (the amount spent on ingredients).\n4. The profit is given as $80. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   2x - 20 = 80\n   \\]\n5.

Calculate the total revenue required to make a profit of $80 after spending $20 on ingredients.\n2. Determine how many cups of lemonade need to be sold to achieve that total revenue.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total revenue required.
