        "To determine the age of Nick's brother in 5 years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the current age of Nick's sister.\n2. Calculate the combined age of Nick and his sister.\n3. Determine the current age of Nick's brother.\n4. Calculate the brother's age in 5 years.\n\nFirst, we know that Nick is 13 years old and his sister is 6 years older than Nick. Therefore, the current age of Nick's sister is:\n\\[ 13 + 6 = 19 \\]\n\nNext, we find the combined age of Nick and his sister:\n\\[ 13 + 19 = 32 \\]\n\nNick's brother is half their combined age. Therefore, the current age of Nick's brother is:\n\\[ \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\]\n\nIn 5 years, Nick's brother will be:\n\\[ 16 + 5 = 21 \\]\n\nThus, the age of Nick's brother in 5 years will be \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",

        "To determine the age of Nick's brother in 5 years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the current age of Nick's sister.\n2. Calculate the combined age of Nick and his sister.\n3. Determine the current age of Nick's brother.\n4. Find out how old Nick's brother will be in 5 years.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Nick is 13 years old and his sister is 6 years older than Nick. Therefore, the current age of Nick's sister is:\n\\[ 13 + 6 = 19 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the combined age of Nick and his sister:\n\\[ 13 + 19 = 32 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nNick's brother is half their combined age. Therefore, the current age of Nick's brother is:\n\\[ \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nFinally, we need to find out how old Nick's brother will be in 5 years. We add 5 to his current age:\n\\[ 16 + 5 = 21 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nSo, the age of Nick's brother in 5 years will be:\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]"
