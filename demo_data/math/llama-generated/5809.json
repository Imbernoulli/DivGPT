Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of green crayons} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Pink Crayons:**\n   To find the number of pink crayons, we subtract the total number of red, blue, and green crayons from the total number of crayons in the box. First, we sum the number of red, blue, and green crayons:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of red, blue, and green crayons} = 8 + 6 + 4 = 18\n   \\]\n   Then, we subtract this sum from the total number of crayons:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pink crayons} = 24 - 18 = 6\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of pink crayons is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
