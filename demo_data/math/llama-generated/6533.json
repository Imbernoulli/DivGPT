        "To determine how much money Aaron will owe his dad, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the guitar without interest.\n2. Calculate the interest on the loan.\n3.

Aaron is paying $100.00 per month for 12 months:\n\\[\n100 \\times 12 = 1200\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the guitar is $1200.\n\nNext, let's calculate the interest on the loan. The interest rate is 10%, so we need to find 10% of $1200:\n\\[\n1200 \\times 0.10 = 120\n\\]\nSo, the interest on the loan is $120.\n\nFinally, let's add the interest to the total cost of the guitar to find out how much money Aaron will owe his dad:\n\\[\n1200 + 120 = 1320\n\\]\nTherefore, Aaron will owe his dad \\boxed{1320}.",
