        "To determine how many mice Gina's snake will eat in a decade, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of weeks in a decade:**\n   - There are 52 weeks in a year.\n   - A decade is 10 years.\n   - Therefore, the total number of weeks in a decade is:\n     \\[\n     52 \\text{ weeks/year} \\times 10 \\text{ years} = 520 \\text{ weeks}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many mice the snake eats in a week:**\n   - The snake eats one mouse every 4 weeks.\n   - To find the number of mice eaten per week, we take:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1 \\text{ mouse}}{4 \\text{ weeks}} = 0.25 \\text{ mice/week}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of mice eaten in a decade:**\n   - multiply the number of weeks in a decade by the number of mice eaten per week:\n     \\[\n     520 \\text{ weeks} \\times 0.25 \\text{ mice/week} = 130 \\text{ mice}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of mice Gina's snake will eat in a decade is \\(\\boxed{130}\\).",

To find out how many mice the snake will eat in 520 weeks, we divide the total number of weeks by the number of weeks it takes to eat one mouse:\n\\[ 520 \\text{ weeks} \\div 4 \\text{ weeks/mouse} = 130 \\text{ mice} \\]\n\nSo, the number of mice Gina's snake will eat in a decade is:\n\\[ \\boxed{130} \\]",
        "To determine how many mice Gina's snake will eat in a decade, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of weeks in a year:**\n   There are 52 weeks in a year.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of weeks in a decade:**\n   A decade is 10 years. Therefore, the number of weeks in a decade is:\n   \\[\n   52 \\text{ weeks/year} \\times 10 \\text{ years} = 520 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many mice the snake eats per week:**\n   The snake eats one mouse every 4 weeks. Therefore, the number of mice it eats per week is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1 \\text{ mouse}}{4 \\text{ weeks}} = 0.25 \\text{ mice/week}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of mice eaten in a decade:**\n   To find the total number of mice eaten in 520 weeks, we multiply the number of weeks by the number of mice eaten per week:\n   \\[\n   520 \\text{ weeks} \\times 0.25 \\text{ mice/week} = 130 \\text{ mice}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Gina's snake will eat \\boxed{130} mice in a decade."
