        "To determine how many minutes Walter spent looking at the seals, we start by defining the time he spent looking at the seals as \\( x \\) minutes.

Additionally, he spent 13 minutes looking at the elephants. The total time spent at the zoo is given as 2 hours and 10 minutes, which we need to convert to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 2 hours and 10 minutes is equal to \\( 2 \\times 60 + 10 = 130 \\) minutes.\n\nWe can now set up the following equation to represent the total time spent at the zoo:\n\\[\nx + 8x + 13 = 130\n\\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[\n9x + 13 = 130\n\\]\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting 13 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n9x = 117\n\\]\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 9:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{117}{9} = 13\n\\]\nTherefore, Walter spent \\(\\boxed{13}\\) minutes looking at the seals.",

The total time spent at the zoo is 2 hours and 10 minutes, which is equivalent to \\( 2 \\times 60 + 10 = 130 \\) minutes.\n\nThe equation that represents the total time spent at the zoo is:\n\\[\nx + 8x + 13 = 130\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[\n9x + 13 = 130\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting 13 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n9x = 117\n\\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 9:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{117}{9} = 13\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Walter spent \\(\\boxed{13}\\) minutes looking at the seals.",
        "To determine how many minutes Walter spent looking at the seals, we start by converting the total time he spent at the zoo into minutes.
