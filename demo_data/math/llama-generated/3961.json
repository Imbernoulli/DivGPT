        "To determine how much time Helen spends hand washing her pillowcases in one year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of 4-week periods in a year:**\n   - There are 52 weeks in a year.\n   - Each period is 4 weeks.\n   - Number of periods in a year = \\(\\frac{52}{4}\\).\n   \\[\n   \\frac{52}{4} = 13\n   \\]\n   So, there are 13 four-week periods in a year.\n\n2. **Determine the time spent hand washing in each 4-week period:**\n   - Helen spends 30 minutes hand washing her pillowcases every 4 weeks.\n\n3. **Calculate the total time spent hand washing in a year:**\n   - Total time = Number of periods \\(\\times\\) Time per period.\n   \\[\n   13 \\times 30 = 390\n   \\]\n   So, Helen spends 390 minutes hand washing her pillowcases in one year.\n\nTherefore, the total time Helen spends hand washing her pillowcases in one year is \\(\\boxed{390}\\) minutes.",
        "To determine how much time Helen spends hand washing her pillowcases in one year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

To find out how many times she hand washes her pillowcases in one year, we divide 52 by 4:\n\n\\[ 52 \\div 4 = 13 \\]\n\nSo, Helen hand washes her pillowcases 13 times in one year. Next, we know that it takes her 30 minutes to hand wash all of them each time.
