        "To determine the total number of candies remaining after Carlos ate all the yellow candies, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of yellow candies:**\n   - We know there are 40 red candies.\n   - The number of yellow candies is 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies.\n   - First, find three times the number of red candies:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 40 = 120\n     \\]\n   - Then, subtract 20 from this result to get the number of yellow candies:\n     \\[\n     120 - 20 = 100\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of blue candies:**\n   - The number of blue candies is half as many as the number of yellow candies.\n   - Since there are 100 yellow candies, we find half of this number:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{100}{2} = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of candies:**\n   - Add the number of red, yellow, and blue candies together:\n     \\[\n     40 + 100 + 50 = 190\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of candies remaining after Carlos ate all the yellow candies:**\n   - Subtract the number of yellow candies from the total number of candies:\n     \\[\n     190 - 100 = 90\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of candies remaining is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of candies remaining after Carlos ate all the yellow candies, we need to calculate the number of each type of candy and then find out how many candies are left after Carlos eats the yellow ones.\n\nFirst, we know the number of red candies:\n\\[ \\text{Red candies} = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of yellow candies.

Let's denote the number of blue candies as \\( B \\):\n\\[ B = \\frac{Y}{2} \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( Y \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ B = \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total number of candies by adding the number of red, yellow, and blue candies together:\n\\[ \\text{Total candies} = R + Y + B = 40 + 100 + 50 = 190 \\]\n\nAfter Carlos ate all the yellow candies, the number of candies remaining is the total number of candies minus the number of yellow candies:\n\\[ \\text{Remaining candies} = 190 - Y = 190 - 100 = 90 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of candies remaining is:\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]",

Subtract the number of yellow candies from the total number of candies.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of yellow candies. According to the problem, there are 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies. Since there are 40 red candies, we can express the number of yellow candies as:\n\\[\n3 \\times 40 - 20 = 120 - 20 = 100\n\\]\nSo, there are 100 yellow candies.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of blue candies.
