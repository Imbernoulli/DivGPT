Say you bought 2 shirts and 3 pairs of pants for $120 in total, then you realized you didn't need the extra pants. What's the price of 1 shirt at this place if when you returned all 3 pairs of pants you were refunded 25% of what you originally paid?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The total cost of 2 shirts and 3 pairs of pants is $120.\n2. Returning all 3 pairs of pants results in a refund of 25% of the original total cost.\n\nFirst, we can write the equation for the total cost of 2 shirts and 3 pairs of pants:\n\\[\n2s + 3p = 120\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the refund amount. Since the refund is 25% of the original total cost:\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 120 = 30\n\\]\n\nThis means that returning 3 pairs of pants results in a refund of $30. Therefore, the cost of 3 pairs of pants is $30:\n\\[\n3p = 30\n\\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( p \\) by dividing both sides by 3:\n\\[\np = 10\n\\]\n\nNow that we know the price of one pair of pants is $10, we substitute \\( p = 10 \\) back into the first equation:\n\\[\n2s + 3(10) = 120\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[\n2s + 30 = 120\n\\]\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( s \\):\n\\[\n2s = 90\n\\]\n\nFinally, solve for \\( s \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[\ns = 45\n\\]\n\nThus, the price of one shirt is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
