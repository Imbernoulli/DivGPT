        "To determine how many feet of yarn Joy used for the second ball, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the size of the first ball:**\n   Joy used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball, which is three times as large as the first ball. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times \\text{size of the first ball} = 27\n   \\]\n   Solving for the size of the first ball, we divide both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{size of the first ball} = \\frac{27}{3} = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the size of the second ball:**\n   The second ball is twice the size of the first ball. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{size of the second ball} = 2 \\times \\text{size of the first ball}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the size of the first ball into the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{size of the second ball} = 2 \\times 9 = 18\n   \\]\n\nThus, Joy used \\(\\boxed{18}\\) feet of yarn for the second ball.",

Use the relationship between the first and second balls to find the amount of yarn used for the second ball.\n\nLet's start by defining the variables:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the amount of yarn used for the first ball.\n- The second ball is twice the size of the first ball, so it uses \\( 2x \\) feet of yarn.\n- The third ball is three times as large as the first ball, so it uses \\( 3x \\) feet of yarn.\n\nWe know from the problem statement that Joy used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 3x = 27 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ x = \\frac{27}{3} = 9 \\]\n\nSo, Joy used 9 feet of yarn for the first ball. Since the second ball is twice the size of the first ball, we calculate the amount of yarn used for the second ball as follows:\n\\[ 2x = 2 \\times 9 = 18 \\]\n\nTherefore, Joy used \\(\\boxed{18}\\) feet of yarn for the second ball.",

According to the problem, the third ball is three times as large as the first ball. Therefore, the amount of yarn used for the third ball is \\( 3x \\) feet. We know that the third ball used 27 feet of yarn, so we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 3x = 27 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ x = \\frac{27}{3} = 9 \\]\n\nSo, Joy used 9 feet of yarn for the first ball. Next, we need to find out how many feet of yarn she used for the second ball. The problem states that the first ball is half the size of the second ball. Therefore, the second ball is twice the size of the first ball. This means the amount of yarn used for the second ball is \\( 2x \\) feet. Since \\( x = 9 \\), we can calculate the amount of yarn used for the second ball as follows:\n\\[ 2x = 2 \\times 9 = 18 \\]\n\nThus, Joy used \\(\\boxed{18}\\) feet of yarn for the second ball.",
