        "To determine how much time using a calculator will save Matt, we need to calculate the total time it takes to complete the assignment with and without a calculator, and then find the difference between these two times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time it takes to complete the assignment with a calculator. Since it takes Matt 2 minutes per problem and the assignment has 20 problems, we multiply the time per problem by the number of problems:\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ minutes/problem} \\times 20 \\text{ problems} = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time it takes to complete the assignment without a calculator.
