        "To determine how many pencils Tommy has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's define the number of pencils as \\( p \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of pens is twice the number of pencils. Therefore, the number of pens is \\( 2p \\).\n\nWe also know that Tommy has one eraser. The total number of items in the pencil case is the sum of the number of pencils, pens, and erasers. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ p + 2p + 1 = 13 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 3p + 1 = 13 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( p \\), we subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3p = 12 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ p = 4 \\]\n\nSo, the number of pencils Tommy has is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
