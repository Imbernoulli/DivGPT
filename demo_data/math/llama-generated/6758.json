        "Let's denote Leila's original savings by \\( S \\). According to the problem, Leila spent \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of her savings on make-up. Therefore, the amount she spent on make-up is \\( \\frac{3}{4}S \\). The rest of her savings, which she spent on the sweater, is \\( S - \\frac{3}{4}S = \\frac{1}{4}S \\). We know that the sweater cost her $20. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4}S = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( S \\), we need to solve for \\( S \\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[\nS = 20 \\times 4 = 80\n\\]\n\nThus, Leila's original savings were \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
