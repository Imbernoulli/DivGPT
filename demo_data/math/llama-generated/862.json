So, the total sleep in December is:\n\\[ 31 \\times 6.5 \\]\n\nWe can break this down into two simpler multiplications:\n\\[ 31 \\times 6.5 = 31 \\times \\left(6 + 0.5\\right) = (31 \\times 6) + (31 \\times 0.5) \\]\n\\[ 31 \\times 6 = 186 \\]\n\\[ 31 \\times 0.5 = 15.5 \\]\n\\[ 186 + 15.5 = 201.5 \\]\n\nSo, Angela slept a total of 201.5 hours in December.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total sleep Angela got in January. January also has 31 days, and she slept 8.5 hours each night. So, the total sleep in January is:\n\\[ 31 \\times 8.5 \\]\n\nWe can break this down into two simpler multiplications:\n\\[ 31 \\times 8.5 = 31 \\times \\left(8 + 0.5\\right) = (31 \\times 8) + (31 \\times 0.5) \\]\n\\[ 31 \\times 8 = 248 \\]\n\\[ 31 \\times 0.5 = 15.5 \\]\n\\[ 248 + 15.5 = 263.5 \\]\n\nSo, Angela slept a total of 263.5 hours in January.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more sleep Angela got in January compared to December. We do this by subtracting the total sleep in December from the total sleep in January:\n\\[ 263.5 - 201.5 = 62 \\]\n\nTherefore, Angela got \\(\\boxed{62}\\) more hours of sleep in January.",
