        "To determine the cost of each single steak knife, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of steak knives Elizabeth is buying.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the steak knives.\n3. Divide the total cost by the total number of steak knives to find the cost per single steak knife.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of steak knives.

Divide the total cost by the total number of steak knives to find the cost per single steak knife.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of steak knives. The couple registered for 2 sets, and each set contains 4 steak knives. So, the total number of steak knives is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ sets} \\times 4 \\text{ knives per set} = 8 \\text{ knives} \\]\n\nNext, let's determine the total cost of the steak knife sets. Each set costs $80.00, and Elizabeth is buying 2 sets. So, the total cost is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ sets} \\times 80 \\text{ dollars per set} = 160 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we divide the total cost by the total number of steak knives to find the cost per single steak knife:\n\\[ \\frac{160 \\text{ dollars}}{8 \\text{ knives}} = 20 \\text{ dollars per knife} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of each single steak knife is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
