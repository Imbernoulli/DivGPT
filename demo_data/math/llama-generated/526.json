        "To determine the difference in percentage points between the percentage of nails painted blue and the percentage painted striped, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of nails:**\n   Jill has 20 nails in total.\n\n2. **Determine the number of nails painted purple:**\n   Jill paints 6 nails purple.\n\n3. **Determine the number of nails painted blue:**\n   Jill paints 8 nails blue.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of nails painted striped:**\n   Since the total number of nails is 20, and we know the number painted purple and blue, we can find the number painted striped by subtracting the sum of purple and blue nails from the total:\n   \\[\n   20 - (6 + 8) = 20 - 14 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, Jill paints 6 nails striped.\n\n5. **Calculate the percentage of nails painted blue:**\n   To find the percentage of nails painted blue, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage of blue nails} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of blue nails}}{\\text{Total number of nails}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage of blue nails} = \\left( \\frac{8}{20} \\right) \\times 100 = 40\\%\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the percentage of nails painted striped:**\n   Similarly, to find the percentage of nails painted striped, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage of striped nails} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of striped nails}}{\\text{Total number of nails}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage of striped nails} = \\left( \\frac{6}{20} \\right) \\times 100 = 30\\%\n   \\]\n\n7. **Determine the difference in percentage points:**\n   To find the difference between the percentage of nails painted blue and the percentage painted striped, we subtract the percentage of striped nails from the percentage of blue nails:\n   \\[\n   40\\% - 30\\% = 10\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the difference in percentage points between the percentage of nails painted blue and the percentage painted striped is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
