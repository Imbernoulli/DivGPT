        "Let's denote Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income by \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we know that before her salary increase, she spent 40% of her income on rent and utilities. Therefore, the amount she spent on rent and utilities before the increase is:\n\\[ 0.4x \\]\n\nAfter her salary increase, her new monthly income is:\n\\[ x + 600 \\]\n\nNow, her rent and utilities amount to 25% of her new monthly income. Therefore, the amount she spends on rent and utilities after the increase is:\n\\[ 0.25(x + 600) \\]\n\nSince the amount spent on rent and utilities remains the same before and after the increase, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600) \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\). First, we distribute the 0.25 on the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 0.4x = 0.25x + 150 \\]\n\nThen, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting \\( 0.25x \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 0.4x - 0.25x = 150 \\]\n\\[ 0.15x = 150 \\]\n\nFinally, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 0.15:\n\\[ x = \\frac{150}{0.15} \\]\n\\[ x = 1000 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was \\(\\boxed{1000}\\).",
