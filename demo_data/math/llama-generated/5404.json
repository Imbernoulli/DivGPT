        "To determine how many years it will take Zach to accomplish his goal of taking his son to see at least one game at each of the 30 major league baseball stadiums, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost for Zach to visit all 30 stadiums.\n2. Determine how many years it will take Zach to save enough money to cover the total cost.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Zach to visit all 30 stadiums.**\n\nThe average cost per stadium is $900. Therefore, the total cost for 30 stadiums is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 900 = 27000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many years it will take Zach to save enough money to cover the total cost.**\n\nZach can save $1,500 per year. To find out how many years it will take him to save $27,000, we divide the total cost by his annual savings:\n\\[ \\frac{27000}{1500} = 18 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nThus, it will take Zach \\(\\boxed{18}\\) years to accomplish his goal.",
