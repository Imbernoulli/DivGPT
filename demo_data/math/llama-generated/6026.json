        "To determine the total cost for Tom to search for an item for 10 days, we need to break down the cost into two parts: the cost for the first 5 days and the cost for the remaining days.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost for the first 5 days:**\n   Tom charges $100 per day for the first 5 days.\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ days} \\times \\$100/\\text{day} = \\$500\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cost for the remaining days:**\n   After the first 5 days, Tom charges $60 per day.
