Calculate the cost of a jar of almond butter.\n2. Determine the cost to make one batch of peanut butter cookies.\n3. Determine the cost to make one batch of almond butter cookies.\n4. Find the difference in cost between one batch of almond butter cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of a jar of almond butter. Since a jar of almond butter costs three times the amount that a jar of peanut butter does, and a jar of peanut butter costs $3, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of a jar of almond butter} = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the cost to make one batch of peanut butter cookies. Since it takes half a jar of peanut butter to make a batch of cookies, and a jar of peanut butter costs $3, the cost for one batch of peanut butter cookies is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of one batch of peanut butter cookies} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 = 1.5 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThen, we determine the cost to make one batch of almond butter cookies. Since it takes half a jar of almond butter to make a batch of cookies, and a jar of almond butter costs $9, the cost for one batch of almond butter cookies is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of one batch of almond butter cookies} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9 = 4.5 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference in cost between one batch of almond butter cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in cost} = 4.5 - 1.5 = 3 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it costs \\(\\boxed{3}\\) dollars more per batch to make almond butter cookies instead of peanut butter cookies.",
