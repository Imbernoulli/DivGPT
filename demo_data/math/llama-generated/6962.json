        "To determine the total number of buttons Sally needs to sew all the shirts, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of shirts Sally sews over the three days.\n2. Determine the total number of buttons needed for all the shirts.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of shirts Sally sews.**\n\n- On Monday, Sally sews 4 shirts.\n- On Tuesday, Sally sews 3 shirts.\n- On Wednesday, Sally sews 2 shirts.\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[\n4 + 3 + 2 = 9 \\text{ shirts}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of buttons needed for all the shirts.**\n\nEach shirt has 5 buttons. Therefore, for 9 shirts, the total number of buttons needed is:\n\\[\n9 \\times 5 = 45 \\text{ buttons}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of buttons Sally needs to sew all the shirts is \\boxed{45}.",
        "To determine the total number of buttons Sally needs, we first need to calculate the total number of shirts she sews over the three days. We can do this by adding the number of shirts sewn each day:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ shirts (Monday)} + 3 \\text{ shirts (Tuesday)} + 2 \\text{ shirts (Wednesday)} = 9 \\text{ shirts}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that each shirt has 5 buttons.
