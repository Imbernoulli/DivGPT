        "To determine the total amount of bird food Herman needs for December, January, and February, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of food Herman feeds the birds each day. He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of food per day is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\text{ cup}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of days in December, January, and February. December has 31 days, January has 31 days, and February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year). So, the total number of days in these three months is:\n\\[\n31 + 31 + 28 = 90 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total amount of food Herman needs for all three months by multiplying the amount of food per day by the total number of days:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ cup/day} \\times 90 \\text{ days} = 90 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of bird food Herman will need for all three months is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]",

        "To determine the total amount of bird food Herman will need for December, January, and February, we can break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of food Herman feeds the birds each day. He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of food per day is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ cup} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ cup} = 1 \\text{ cup}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days are in December, January, and February. \n\n- December has 31 days.\n- January has 31 days.\n- February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of days in these three months:\n\\[\n31 \\text{ days} + 31 \\text{ days} + 28 \\text{ days} = 90 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nNow, we multiply the total number of days by the amount of food反射 each day to find the total amount of food needed for all three months:\n\\[\n90 \\text{ days} \\times 1 \\text{ cup per day} = 90 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nThus, Herman will need \\boxed{90} cups of bird food for December, January, and February.",
        "To determine how many cups of food Herman will need for all three months, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the daily amount of food Herman uses:**\n   - Herman feeds the birds 1/2 cup in the morning.\n   - Herman feeds the birds 1/2 cup in the afternoon.\n   - Total daily amount of food = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) cup + \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) cup = 1 cup.\n\n2. **Determine the number of days in each month:**\n   - December has 31 days.\n   - January has 31 days.\n   - February has 28 days (assuming it is not a leap year).\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of days in all three months:**\n   \\[\n   31 \\text{ days} + 31 \\text{ days} + 28 \\text{ days} = 90 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount of food needed for 90 days:**\n   - Daily amount of food = 1 cup.\n   - Total amount of food = 90 days \\(\\times\\) 1 cup/day = 90 cups.\n\nTherefore, Herman will need \\(\\boxed{90}\\) cups of food for all three months."
