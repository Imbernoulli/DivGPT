        "To determine the total number of watches Julia owns after her purchase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of bronze watches Julia owns.\n2. Determine the total number of watches Julia owns before buying the gold watches.\n3. Calculate the number of gold watches she buys.\n4. Find the total number of watches Julia owns after the purchase.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of bronze watches Julia owns. She has three times as many bronze watches as silver watches. Since she has 20 silver watches, the number of bronze watches is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 20 = 60\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of watches Julia owns before buying the gold watches. This is the sum of the silver and bronze watches:\n\\[\n20 + 60 = 80\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of gold watches she buys. She decides to buy a number of gold watches that represents 10% of all the watches she owns. Therefore, the number of gold watches is:\n\\[\n0.10 \\times 80 = 8\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the total number of watches Julia owns after the purchase. This is the sum of the silver, bronze, and gold watches:\n\\[\n80 + 8 = 88\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of watches Julia owns after the purchase is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88}\n\\]",
