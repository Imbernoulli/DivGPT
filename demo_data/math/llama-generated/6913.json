        "To determine how many dollars cheaper the promotional subscription is compared to the normal subscription, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of issues in an 18-month subscription:**\n   - The magazine is issued twice a month.\n   - Therefore, the total number of issues in 18 months is:\n     \\[\n     18 \\text{ months} \\times 2 \\text{ issues/month} = 36 \\text{ issues}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the discount per issue:**\n   - The promotion offers $0.25 off each issue.\n\n3. **Calculate the total discount for all issues:**\n   - The total discount is the discount per issue multiplied by the total number of issues:\n     \\[\n     36 \\text{ issues} \\times 0.25 \\text{ dollars/issue} = 9 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the cost of the promotional subscription:**\n   - Subtract the total discount from the normal subscription price:\n     \\[\n     34 \\text{ dollars} - 9 \\text{ dollars} = 25 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine how many dollars cheaper the promotional subscription is:**\n   - The difference between the normal subscription price and the promotional subscription price is:\n     \\[\n     34 \\text{ dollars} - 25 \\text{ dollars} = 9 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the promotional subscription is \\(\\boxed{9}\\) dollars cheaper than the normal one."
