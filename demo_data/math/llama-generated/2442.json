        "To determine how many more pencils the electric sharpener can sharpen than the hand-crank sharpener in six minutes, we need to calculate the number of pencils each sharpener can sharpen in that time and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, we convert six minutes into seconds:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ minutes} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds per minute} = 360 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many pencils the hand-crank sharpener can sharpen in 360 seconds. Since the hand-crank sharpener sharpens one pencil every 45 seconds, we divide 360 by 45:\n\\[\n360 \\div 45 = 8\n\\]\nSo, the hand-crank sharpener can sharpen 8 pencils in six minutes.\n\nNow, we calculate how many pencils the electric sharpener can sharpen in 360 seconds. Since the electric sharpener sharpens one pencil every 20 seconds, we divide 360 by 20:\n\\[\n360 \\div 20 = 18\n\\]\nSo, the electric sharpener can sharpen 18 pencils in six minutes.\n\nTo find out how many more pencils the electric sharpener can sharpen than the hand-crank sharpener, we subtract the number of pencils sharpened by the hand-crank sharpener from the number of pencils sharpened by the electric sharpener:\n\\[\n18 - 8 = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the electric sharpener can sharpen \\(\\boxed{10}\\) more pencils than the hand-crank sharpener in six minutes.",
