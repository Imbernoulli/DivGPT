        "To determine how many acres of land Joyce now owns that are suitable for growing vegetables, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total area of Joyce's new property.\n2. Subtract the area of the pond from the total area of the new property to find the suitable land for growing vegetables.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total area of Joyce's new property. Since her new property is 10 times larger than her previous property, and her previous property was 2 acres, we multiply 2 acres by 10:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ acres} \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ acres}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the area of the pond from the total area of the new property. The pond is 1 acre, so we subtract 1 acre from 20 acres:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ acres} - 1 \\text{ acre} = 19 \\text{ acres}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of acres of land Joyce now owns that are suitable for growing vegetables is \\boxed{19}.",
