Since the tax rate is 10%, we can find the tax amount by multiplying Jebb's pay by 10% (or 0.10).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Tax amount} = 650 \\times 0.10 = 65\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the tax amount from Jebb's total pay to find his take-home pay.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Take-home pay} = 650 - 65 = 585\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jebb's take-home pay is \\(\\boxed{585}\\).",
        "To determine Jebb's take-home pay after accounting for a 10% tax on his $650 pay, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of tax Jebb needs to pay.\n2. Subtract the tax amount from the original pay to find the take-home pay.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the tax amount. The tax rate is 10%, so we need to find 10% of $650. This can be done by multiplying $650 by 0.10:\n\\[\n650 \\times 0.10 = 65\n\\]\nSo, Jebb needs to pay $65 in tax.\n\nNext, we subtract the tax amount from the original pay to find the take-home pay:\n\\[\n650 - 65 = 585\n\\]\nTherefore, Jebb's take-home pay is \\(\\boxed{585}\\).",
