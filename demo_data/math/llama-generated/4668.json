        "To determine the percentage of gingerbread cookies that have red hats, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of gingerbread cookies.\n2. Determine the number of gingerbread cookies with red hats.\n3. Calculate the percentage of gingerbread cookies with red hats.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of gingerbread cookies. We know that 6 cookies have red hats, 9 cookies have blue boots, and 3 cookies have both red hats and blue boots. Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the total number of cookies is given by:\n\\[\n6 + 9 - 3 = 12\n\\]\nSo, there are 12 gingerbread cookies in total.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of gingerbread cookies with red hats. This is simply the number of cookies given red hats, which is 6.\n\nNow, we calculate the percentage of gingerbread cookies that have red hats. The percentage is given by:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of cookies with red hats}}{\\text{Total number of cookies}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{6}{12} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of gingerbread men that have red hats is \\(\\boxed{50}\\)."
