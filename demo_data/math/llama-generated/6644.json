        "To determine the total number of plates Wickham needs for his Christmas party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of guests:**\n   - Wickham invites 30 people.\n   - Half of the guests bring a plus one. Therefore, the number of guests who bring a plus one is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n     \\]\n   - Each of these 15 guests brings one additional person, so the total number of plus ones is:\n     \\[\n     15\n     \\]\n   - Adding the plus ones to the original number of guests gives us the total number of guests:\n     \\[\n     30 + 15 = 45\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of plates needed per guest:**\n   - Each guest will use a new plate for each course. Since there are 3 courses, each guest will use:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ plates}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of plates needed:**\n   - Multiply the total number of guests by the number of plates each guest uses:\n     \\[\n     45 \\times 3 = 135\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Wickham needs \\(\\boxed{135}\\) plates in total for his guests.",

Wickham invites 30 people, and half of these guests bring a plus one. So, the number of guests who bring a plus one is:\n\\[ \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\]\nSince each of these 15 guests brings one additional person, the total number of plus ones is 15.
