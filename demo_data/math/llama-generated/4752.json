        "To determine how many episodes Donna can watch in a week, we need to break down her viewing habits by weekdays and weekends.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of episodes Donna watches on weekdays.

There are 2 days in the weekend, and she watches three times the number of episodes she watches on a weekday. Since she watches 8 episodes each weekday, she watches:\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\nepisodes each weekend day. Therefore, the total number of episodes she watches on weekends is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 24 = 48 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of episodes she watches on weekdays and weekends to find the total number of episodes she watches in a week:\n\\[ 40 + 48 = 88 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of episodes Donna can watch in a week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88} \\]",

Therefore, the total number of episodes she watches on weekdays is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of episodes Donna watches on weekend days. There are 2 weekend days in a week, and she watches three times the number of episodes she watches on a weekday. Since she watches 8 episodes each weekday, she watches:\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\nepisodes each weekend day. Therefore, the total number of episodes she watches on weekend days is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 24 = 48 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of episodes she watches on weekdays and weekend days to find the total number of episodes she watches in a week:\n\\[ 40 + 48 = 88 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of episodes Donna can watch in a week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88} \\]",
