There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 120 feet by 12 inches per foot:\n\n\\[ 120 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 1440 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNext, we divide the total length of the row in inches by the space required for each seed, which is 18 inches:\n\n\\[ 1440 \\text{ inches} \\div 18 \\text{ inches/seed} = 80 \\text{ seeds} \\]\n\nTherefore, Bob can plant \\(\\boxed{80}\\) seeds in each row.",
