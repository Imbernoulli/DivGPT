Since each box contains 10 doughnuts and the bakery sells 27 boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of doughnuts per box:\n\\[\n27 \\text{ boxes} \\times 10 \\text{ doughnuts/box} = 270 \\text{ doughnuts}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of doughnuts sold from the total number of doughnuts made:\n\\[\n300 \\text{ doughnuts} - 270 \\text{ doughnuts} = 30 \\text{ doughnuts}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of doughnuts given away at the end of the day is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
