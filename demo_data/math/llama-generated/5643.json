        "To determine the total number of chairs left in Rodrigo's classroom after Lisa borrows 3 chairs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of yellow chairs.\n2. Calculate the number of blue chairs.\n3. Find the total number of chairs in the morning.\n4. Subtract the number of chairs Lisa borrows from the total number of chairs in the morning.\n\nLet's start with the number of yellow chairs. According to the problem, there are 2 times as many yellow chairs as red chairs. Since there are 4 red chairs, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of yellow chairs} = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of blue chairs. The problem states that there are 2 fewer blue chairs than yellow chairs. Since there are 8 yellow chairs, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue chairs} = 8 - 2 = 6\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the total number of chairs in the morning by adding the number of red chairs, yellow chairs, and blue chairs:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of chairs in the morning} = 4 + 8 + 6 = 18\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of chairs Lisa borrows from the total number of chairs in the morning:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of chairs left} = 18 - 3 = 15\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of chairs left in Rodrigo's classroom is \\boxed{15}.",

Therefore, we can calculate the number of blue chairs as follows:\n\\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \\]\nSo, there are 6 blue chairs.\n\nNow, we add up the number of red, yellow, and blue chairs to find the total number of chairs in the morning:\n\\[ 4 + 8 + 6 = 18 \\]\nSo, there are 18 chairs in the morning.\n\nIn the afternoon, Lisa borrows 3 chairs.
