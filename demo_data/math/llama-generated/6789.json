Convert the distance Christina drives into minutes based on her speed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance her friend drives. Her friend drives for 3 hours at a speed of 40 miles per hour. So, the distance her friend drives is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} \\times 40 \\text{ miles per hour} = 120 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the distance her friend drives from the total distance to find out how far Christina drives. The total distance is 210 miles, so:\n\\[ 210 \\text{ miles} - 120 \\text{ miles} = 90 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nChristina drives at a speed of 30 miles per hour. To find out how many hours Christina drives, we divide the distance she drives by her speed:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ miles} \\div 30 \\text{ miles per hour} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the time Christina drives from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the number of hours by 60:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of minutes Christina will drive is:\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]",
