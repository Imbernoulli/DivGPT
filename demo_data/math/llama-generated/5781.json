        "To determine how many people are not in the pool, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of people:**\n   - Karen and Donald have 6 children, so their family consists of \\(2 + 6 = 8\\) people.\n   - Tom and Eva have 4 children, so their family consists of \\(2 + 4 = 6\\) people.\n   - Therefore, the total number of people is \\(8 + 6 = 14\\).\n\n2. **Determine the total number of legs:**\n   - Each person has 2 legs.\n   - Thus, the total number of legs for all the people is \\(14 \\times 2 = 28\\).\n\n3. **Find out how many people are in the pool:**\n   - We know there are 16 legs in the pool.\n   - Since each person has 2 legs, the number of people in the pool is \\(16 \\div 2 = 8\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the number of people not in the pool:**\n   - The total number of people is 14.\n   - The number of people in the pool is 8.\n   - Therefore, the number of people not in the pool is \\(14 - 8 = 6\\).\n\nThus, the number of people not in the pool is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
        "To determine how many people are not in the pool, we first need to calculate the total number of people and then use the information about the number of legs in the pool to find out how many people are in the pool.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of people. Karen and Donald have 6 children, and Tom and Eva have 4 children. Therefore, the total number of people is:\n\\[ 2 + 6 + 2 + 4 = 14. \\]\n\nNext, we know that there are 16 legs in the pool.

Subtract the number of people in the pool from the total number of people.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people.**\n\n- Karen and Donald have 6 children.\n  \\[\n  2 + 6 = 8\n  \\]\n  So, Karen and Donald's family consists of 8 people.\n\n- Tom and Eva have 4 children.\n  \\[\n  2 + 4 = 6\n  \\]\n  So, Tom and Eva's family consists of 6 people.\n\n- Add the number of people in both families.\n  \\[\n  8 + 6 = 14\n  \\]\n  Therefore, the total number of people is 14.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of people in the pool based on the number of legs.**\n\n- Each person has 2 legs.\n- There are 16 legs in the pool.\n\n- To find the number of people in the pool, divide the total number of legs by 2.\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n  \\]\n  Therefore, there are 8 people in the pool.\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of people in the pool from the total number of people.**\n\n- Total number of people: 14\n- Number of people in the pool: 8\n\n- Subtract the number of people in the pool from the total number of people.\n  \\[\n  14 - 8 = 6\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people not in the pool is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
        "To determine how many people are not in the pool, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of people:**\n   - Karen and Donald have 6 children, so they make up \\(2 + 6 = 8\\) people.\n   - Tom and Eva have 4 children, so they make up \\(2 + 4 = 6\\) people.\n   - Adding these together, the total number of people is \\(8 + 6 = 14\\).\n\n2. **Determine the number of people in the pool:**\n   - Each person has 2 legs.\n   - There are 16 legs in the pool, so the number of people in the pool is \\(\\frac{16}{2} = 8\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the number of people not in the pool:**\n   - Subtract the number of people in the pool from the total number of people.\n   - This gives us \\(14 - 8 = 6\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of people not in the pool is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
