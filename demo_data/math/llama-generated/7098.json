        "To determine the total amount of money raised by Tree Elementary School for the playground, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount raised by Mrs. Sutton’s class:**\n   Mrs. Johnson’s class raised $2300, which is twice the amount that Mrs. Sutton’s class raised. Therefore, we can find the amount raised by Mrs. Sutton’s class by dividing $2300 by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount raised by Mrs. Sutton's class} = \\frac{2300}{2} = 1150\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the amount raised by Miss Rollin’s class:**\n   Mrs. Sutton’s class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin’s class. This means Miss Rollin’s class raised 8 times the amount raised by Mrs. Sutton’s class. Therefore, we can find the amount raised by Miss Rollin’s class by multiplying $1150 by 8:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount raised by Miss Rollin's class} = 1150 \\times 8 = 9200\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount raised by the school before marvelous fees:**\n   Miss Rollin’s class raised a third of the total amount raised by the school. Therefore, the total amount raised by the school before deducting administration fees is 3 times the amount raised by Miss Rollin’s class:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount raised before fees} = 9200 \\times 3 = 27600\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount raised after deducting administration fees:**\n   The school deducts 2% of the total amount raised for administration fees. First, we calculate 2% of $27600:\n   \\[\n   \\text{没事 fees} = 27600 \\times \\frac{2}{100} = 27600 \\times 0.02 = 552\n   \\]\n   Then, we subtract the administration fees from the total amount raised before fees:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount raised after fees} = 27600 - 552 = 27048\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the school raised for the playground is \\(\\boxed{27048}\\).",
        "To find the total amount of money raised by the school for the playground, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how much Mrs. Sutton's class raised.\n2. Determine how much Miss Rollin's class raised.\n3. Determine the total amount raised by the school before deducting the administration fees.\n4. Calculate the amount left after deducting the administration fees.\n\nFirst, we know that Mrs. Johnson's class raised $2300, which is twice the amount that Mrs. Sutton's class raised.

Therefore, we calculate the administration fees as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Administration fees} = 27600 \\times 0.02 = 552\n\\]\nSubtracting the administration fees from the total amount raised gives us the final amount of money raised for the playground:\n\\[\n\\text{Final amount raised for the playground} = 27600 - 552 = 27048\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money raised for the playground is \\(\\boxed{27048}\\).",

        "Let's start by determining how much money Mrs. Sutton's class raised. We know that Mrs. Johnson's class raised $2300, which is twice the amount that Mrs. Sutton's class raised. Therefore, we can find the amount raised by Mrs. Sutton's class by dividing $2300 by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount raised by Mrs. Sutton's class} = \\frac{2300}{2} = 1150\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Mrs. Sutton's class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin's class. This means that Miss Rollin's class raised 8 times the amount raised by Mrs. Sutton's class. Therefore, we can find the amount raised by Miss Rollin's class by multiplying $1150 by 8:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount raised by Miss Rollin's class} = 1150 \\times 8 = 9200\n\\]\n\nWe also know that Miss Rollin's class raised a third of the total amount raised by the school. Therefore, we can find the total amount raised by the school by multiplying the amount raised by Miss Rollin's class by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount raised by the school} = 9200 \\times 3 = 27600\n\\]\n\nFinally, we need to account for the 2%米尔メリ家用令人/cupertino falls. We calculate 2% of $27600 and subtract it from the total amount raised:\n\n\\[\n\\text{otros Lupקוquence} = 27600 \\times 0.02 = 552\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount left after administration fees} = 27600 - 552 = 27048\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount of money the school raised for the playground, after deducting administration fees, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{27048}\n\\]"
