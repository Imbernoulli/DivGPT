        "To determine the length of each part in inches, we first need to convert the total length of the wire from feet and inches into just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.\n\nThe wire is 5 feet 4 inches long. To convert this to inches, we multiply the number of feet by 12 and then add the remaining inches:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 60 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\\[ 60 \\text{ inches} + 4 \\text{ inches} = 64 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNow that we know the total length of the wire is 64 inches, we need to divide this length into 4 equal parts:\n\n\\[ 64 \\text{ inches} \\div 4 = 16 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nTherefore, each part is \\(\\boxed{16}\\) inches long.",
