The three day attendance this year was 2700 people.  The second day was rainy so only half the number of people that showed up the first day showed up the second day.  The third day was the finale, so attendance was triple the original day.  How many people attended the second day of the festival?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the number of people who attended the second day of the festival, we need to set up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of people who attended the first day as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem:\n- The second day had half the number of people as the first day, so the number of people who attended the second day is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\).\n- The third day had triple the number of people as the first day, so the number of people who attended the third day is \\( 3x \\).\n\nThe total attendance over the three days is given as 2700 people. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\\[\nx + \\frac{x}{2} + 3x = 2700\n\\]\n\nTo solve this equation, first combine the terms on the left-hand side. To do this, find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 1, 2, and 1 is 2. Rewrite each term with a denominator of 2:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2x}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n3x = \\frac{6x}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{2x}{2} + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{6x}{2} = 2700\n\\]\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{2x + x + 6x}{2} = 2700\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{9x}{2} = 2700\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\n9x = 5400\n\\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 9:\n\\[\nx = 600\n\\]\n\nNow that we know the number of people who attended the first day is 600, we can find the number of people who attended the second day:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{600}{2} = 300\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people who attended the second day of the festival is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
        "Let \\( x \\) be the number of people who attended the first day of the festival. According to the problem, the second day had half the attendance of the first day, so the number of people who attended the second day is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\). The third day had triple the attendance of the first day, so the number of people who attended the third day is \\( 3x \\).\n\nThe total attendance over the three days is given as 2700 people. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total attendance:\n\\[\nx + \\frac{x}{2} + 3x = 2700\n\\]\n\nTo solve this equation, we first combine the terms on the left side. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 1, 2, and 3 is 2. So, we rewrite the equation with a common denominator:\n\\[\nx + \\frac{x}{2} + 3x = \\frac{2x}{2} + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{6x}{2} = \\frac{2x + x + 6x}{2} = \\frac{9x}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, we set this equal to 2700:\n\\[\n\\frac{9x}{2} = 2700\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\n9x = 5400\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 9:\n\\[\nx = 600\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of people who attended the first day is 600. The number of people who attended the second day is \\( \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{600}{2} = 300 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of people who attended the second day of the festival is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
