Calculate the total number of string cheeses Kelly's kids eat in one week.\n   - They eat 3 string cheeses per day and there are 5 days in a week.\n   - Therefore, they eat \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) string cheeses per week.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of string cheeses Kelly's kids eat in 4 weeks.\n   - They eat 15 string cheeses per week and there are 4 weeks.\n   - Therefore, they eat \\(15 \\times 4 = 60\\) string cheeses in 4 weeks.\n\n4. Determine how many packages of string cheese Kelly needs.\n   - Each package contains 30 string cheeses.\n   - To find out how many packages are needed, we divide the total number of string cheeses by the number of string cheeses per package: \\(60 \\div 30 = 2\\).\n\nSo, Kelly needs \\(\\boxed{2}\\) packages of string cheese to fill her kids' lunches for 4 weeks.",
