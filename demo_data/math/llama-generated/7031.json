        "To determine how much Alvin earns from selling his marble set, we need to calculate the number of each color of marble and then find out how much he earns from selling each type.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of white marbles:\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \\times 100 = 20 \\text{ white marbles} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of black marbles:\n\\[ 30\\% \\text{ of } 100 = 0.30 \\times 100 = 30 \\text{ black marbles} \\]\n\nThe rest of the marbles are of different colors. To find out how many marbles are of different colors, we subtract the number of white and black marbles from the total number of marbles:\n\\[ 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 \\text{ different color marbles} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the earnings from each type of marble:\n- The white marbles are sold for a nickel each. Since there are 20 white marbles, the earnings from the white marbles are:\n\\[ 20 \\times 0.05 = 1.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n- The black marbles are sold for a dime each. Since there are 30 black marbles, the earnings from the black marbles are:\n\\[ 30 \\times 0.10 = 3.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n- The different color marbles are sold for $0.20 each. Since there are 50 different color marbles, the earnings from the different color marbles are:\n\\[ 50 \\times 0.20 = 10.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we add up the earnings from all the marbles to find the total earnings:\n\\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 10.00 = 14.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Alvin earns \\(\\boxed{14}\\) dollars.",

Add up all the earnings.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of white marbles:**\n   Alvin has 100 marbles, and 20% of them are white.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of white marbles} = 0.20 \\times 100 = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of black marbles:**\n   Alvin has 100 marbles, and 30% of them are black.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of black marbles} = 0.30 \\times 100 = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of marbles of different colors:**\n   The total number of marbles is 100, and the number of white and black marbles together is 20 + 30 = 50.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of marbles of different colors} = 100 - 50 = 50\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the earnings from selling the white marbles:**\n   Each white marble is sold for a nickel (which is $0.05).\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings from white marbles} = 20 \\times 0.05 = 1 \\text{ dollar}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the earnings from selling the black marbles:**\n   Each black marble is sold for a dime (which is $0.10).\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings from black marbles} = 30 \\times 0.10 = 3 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the earnings from selling the marbles of different colors:**\n   Each marble of different colors is sold for $0.20.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings from marbles of different colors} = 50 \\times 0.20 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Add up all the earnings:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total earnings} = 1 + 3 + 10 = 14 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Alvin earns \\(\\boxed{14}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine how much Alvin earns from selling his marble set, we need to calculate the number of each type of marble and then find the total earnings from selling them.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many white marbles Alvin has. Since 20% of the marbles are white:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 100 = 20\n\\]\nSo, Alvin has 20 white marbles. He sells each white marble for a nickel, which is $0.05. Therefore, the earnings from the white marbles are:\n\\[\n20 \\times 0.05 = 1\n\\]\nNext, let's find out how many black marbles Alvin has. Since 30% of the marbles are black:\n\\[\n0.30 \\times 100 = 30\n\\]\nSo, Alvin has 30 black marbles. He sells each black marble for a dime, which is $0.10. Therefore, the earnings from the black marbles are:\n\\[\n30 \\times 0.10 = 3\n\\]\nNow, let's find out how many marbles are of different colors. Since the total number of marbles is 100, and 20 are white and 30 are black, the number of marbles of different colors is:\n\\[\n100 - 20 - 30 = 50\n\\]\nAlvin sells each marble of different colors for $0.20. Therefore, the earnings from the marbles of different colors are:\n\\[\n50 \\times 0.20 = 10\n\\]\nFinally, we add up the earnings from all the marbles:\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 10 = 14\n\\]\nSo, Alvin earns \\(\\boxed{14}\\) dollars.",
