        "To determine how many bracelets Nancy and Rose can make, we need to calculate the total number of beads each person has and then divide by the number of beads required for each bracelet.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of beads Nancy has:\n- Nancy has 40 metal beads.\n- Nancy has 20 more pearl beads than metal beads. Therefore, she has \\( 40 + 20 = 60 \\) pearl beads.\n- The total number of beads Nancy has is \\( 40 + 60 = 100 \\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of beads Rose has:\n- Rose has 20 crystal beads.\n- Rose has twice as many stone beads as crystal beads. Therefore, she has \\( 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\) stone beads.\n- The total number of beads Rose has is \\( 20 + 40 = 60 \\).\n\nNow, let's find the combined total number of beads Nancy and Rose have:\n- The total number of beads is \\( 100 + 60 = 160 \\).\n\nSince each bracelet requires 8 beads, we divide the total number of beads by the number of beads per bracelet to find the total number of bracelets they can make:\n- The number of bracelets they can make is \\( \\frac{160}{8} = 20 \\).\n\nTherefore, Nancy and Rose can make \\(\\boxed{20}\\) bracelets.",
