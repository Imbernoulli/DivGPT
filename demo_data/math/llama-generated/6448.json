        "To determine how much the factory can earn in one day, we need to calculate the total production of material by all the machines and then find out the earnings from that production.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the production of material by the original 3 machines. Each machine works 23 hours a day and produces 2 kg of material per hour. Therefore, the production of material by one machine in one day is:\n\\[ 23 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ kg/hour} = 46 \\text{ kg/day} \\]\n\nSince there are 3 machines, the total production of material by the 3 machines in one day is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 46 \\text{ kg/day} = 138 \\text{ kg/day} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the production of material by the new fourth machine. The fourth machine works 12 hours a day and produces 2 kg of material per hour.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the daily production of the first three machines:**\n   - Each of the first three machines works 23 hours a day and produces 2 kg of material per hour.\n   - Therefore, the daily production of one machine is \\(23 \\text{ hours} \\times 2 \\text{ kg/hour} = 46 \\text{ kg}\\).\n   - Since there are three machines, the total daily production of the first three machines is \\(3 \\times 46 \\text{ kg} = 138 \\text{ kg}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the daily production of the fourth machine:**\n   - The fourth machine works 12 hours a day and produces 2 kg of material per hour.\n   - Therefore, the daily production of the fourth machine is \\(12 \\text{ hours} \\times 2 \\text{ kg/hour} = 24 \\text{ kg}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total daily production of all four machines:**\n   - The total daily production is the sum of the production of the first three machines and the production of the fourth machine.\n   - Therefore, the total daily production is \\(138 \\text{ kg} + 24 \\text{ kg} = 162 \\text{ kg}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the daily earnings:**\n   - The factory sells the produced material for $50 per kg.\n   - Therefore, the daily earnings are \\(162 \\text{ kg} \\times 50 \\text{ dollars/kg} = 8100 \\text{ dollars}\\).\n\nThe factory can earn \\(\\boxed{8100}\\) dollars in one day.",
        "To determine the daily earnings of the factory, we need to calculate the total amount of material produced by all the machines in one day and then convert that into earnings.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily production of each of the original 3 machines. Each machine works 23 hours a day and produces 2 kg of material per hour. Therefore, the daily production of one machine is:\n\\[ 23 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ kg/hour} = 46 \\text{ kg/day} \\]\n\nSince there are 3 machines, the total daily production of the 3 machines is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 46 \\text{ kg/day} = 138 \\text{ kg/day} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the daily production of the fourth machine. The fourth machine works 12 hours a day and produces 2 kg of material per hour.
