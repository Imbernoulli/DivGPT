Multiply the weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the month.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the weekly earnings.**\n\nThe restaurant earns $600 every weekday. Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the earnings for the weekdays in one week are:\n\\[ 600 \\times 5 = 3000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe restaurant earns twice as much on the weekend. Since there are 2 days in the weekend, the earnings for the weekend in one week are:\n\\[ 600 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2400 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the earnings for the weekdays and the weekend gives the total weekly earnings:\n\\[ 3000 + 2400 = 5400 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Multiply the weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the month.**\n\nAssuming the month has four weeks, the total earnings for the month are:\n\\[ 5400 \\times 4 = 21600 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total money earned by the end of the month is:\n\\[ \\boxed{21600} \\]",
