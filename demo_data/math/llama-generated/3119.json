        "To determine how much Lovely will earn if all 10 books are sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of books that can be sold for $2.50 each.\n2. Calculate the number of books that can be sold for $2 each.\n3. Calculate the total earnings from the books sold for $2.50 each.\n4. Calculate the total earnings from the books sold for $2 each.\n5. Add the earnings from both types of books to find the total earnings.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Lovely has 10 books in total, and two-fifths of these books can be sold for $2.50 each. So, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of books sold for } \\$2.50 = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 10 = 4\n\\]\nThis means 4 books will be sold for $2.50 each.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of books that can be sold for $2 each. Since the rest of the books will be sold for $2 each, we subtract the number of books sold for $2.50 from the total number of books:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of books sold for } \\$2 = 10 - 4 = 6\n\\]\nThis means 6 books will be sold for $2 each.\n\nNow, we calculate the total earnings from the books sold for $2.50 each:\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from books sold for } \\$2.50 = 4 \\times 2.50 = 10\n\\]\nSo, Lovely earns $10 from the books sold for $2.50 each.\n\nNext, we calculate the total earnings from the books sold for $2 each:\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from books sold for } \\$2 = 6 \\times 2 = 12\n\\]\nSo, Lovely earns $12 from the books sold for $2 each.\n\nFinally, we add the earnings from both types of books to find the total earnings:\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings} = 10 + 12 = 22\n\\]\nTherefore, Lovely will earn \\boxed{22} dollars if all 10 books were sold.",

Since she has 10 books in total, we calculate the number of books sold for $2.50 each as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times 10 = 4\n\\]\nSo, Lovely can sell 4 books for $2.50 each.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many books can be sold for $2 each. Since the rest of the books are sold for $2 each, we subtract the number of books sold for $2.50 from the total number of books:\n\\[\n10 - 4 = 6\n\\]\nSo, Lovely can sell 6 books for $2 each.\n\nNow, we calculate the total earnings from the books sold for $2.50 each:\n\\[\n4 \\times 2.50 = 10\n\\]\nAnd the total earnings from the books sold for $2 each:\n\\[\n6 \\times 2 = 12\n\\]\nAdding these two amounts together gives us Lovely's total earnings:\n\\[\n10 + 12 = 22\n\\]\nTherefore, Lovely will earn \\(\\boxed{22}\\) dollars if all 10 books were sold.",

Since the total number of books is 10 and 4 books are sold for $2.50 each, the remaining books are:\n\\[\n10 - 4 = 6\n\\]\nSo, 6 books can be sold for $2 each.\n\nNow, for step 3, we calculate the total earnings from the books sold for $2.50 each:\n\\[\n4 \\times 2.50 = 10\n\\]\nThis means that Lovely earns $10 from the books sold for $2.50 each.\n\nFor step 4, we calculate the total earnings from the books sold for $2 each:\n\\[\n6 \\times 2 = 12\n\\]\nThis means that Lovely earns $12 from the books sold for $2 each.\n\nFinally, for step 5, we add the earnings from both types of books to get the total earnings:\n\\[\n10 + 12 = 22\n\\]\nSo, Lovely will earn \\(\\boxed{22}\\) dollars if all 10 books were sold.",

        "To determine how much Lovely will earn from selling all 10 of her books, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the earnings from each category of books.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many of Lovely's books can be sold for $2.50 each. According to the problem, two-fifths of her books can be sold for $2.50 each. Since Lovely has 10 books, we can find the number of books that can be sold for $2.50 each by multiplying 10 by \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\):\n\n\\[\n10 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 4\n\\]\n\nSo, 4 books can be sold for $2.50 each. Next, we calculate the earnings from these 4 books:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 2.50 = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate how many of Lovely's books can be sold for $2 each. Since the rest of the books are sold for $2 each, we subtract the number of books sold for $2.50 each from the total number of books:\n\n\\[\n10 - 4 = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, 6 books can be sold for $2 each. Next, we calculate the earnings from these 6 books:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 2 = 12\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the earnings from both categories of books to find the total earnings:\n\n\\[\n10 + 12 = 22\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Lovely will earn \\(\\boxed{22}\\) dollars if all 10 books were sold.",

Since there are 10 books in total and 4 are sold for $2.50 each, the number of books sold for $2 each is \\(10 - 4 = 6\\).\n\nNow, step 3:\nThe total earnings from the books sold for $2.50 each is \\(4 \\times 2.50 = 10\\).\n\nThen, step 4:\nThe total earnings from the books sold for $2 each is \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\).\n\nFinally, step 5:\nThe total earnings from all the books is \\(10 + 12 = 22\\).\n\nTherefore, Lovely will earn \\(\\boxed{22}\\) dollars.",
