Therefore, the number of mangoes taken out is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times 15 = 10\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of fruits taken out:**\n   Add the number of apples, oranges, and mangoes taken out:\n   \\[\n   2 + 4 + 10 = 16\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the initial total number of fruits in the bag:**\n   Add the number of apples, oranges, and mangoes initially in the bag:\n   \\[\n   7 + 8 + 15 = 30\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the remaining number of fruits in the bag:**\n   Subtract the total number of fruits taken out from the initial total number of fruits:\n   \\[\n   30 - 16 = 14\n   \\]\n\nThus, the remaining number of fruits in the bag is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",

Calculate the number of oranges taken out.\n3. Calculate the number of mangoes taken out.\n4. Subtract the total number of fruits taken out from the initial total number of fruits in the bag.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of apples taken out. Luisa takes out 2 apples.\n\\[\n\\text{Apples taken out} = 2\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of oranges taken out. Luisa takes out twice as many oranges as apples. Since she took out 2 apples, she takes out:\n\\[\n\\text{Oranges taken out} = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n\\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the number of mangoes taken out. Luisa takes out \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the mangoes. Since there are 15 mangoes initially, she takes out:\n\\[\n\\text{Mangoes taken out} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 15 = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the total number of fruits taken out. We add the number of apples, oranges, and mangoes taken out:\n\\[\n\\text{Total fruits taken out} = 2 + 4 + 10 = 16\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of fruits taken out from the initial total number of fruits in the bag. The initial total number of fruits is:\n\\[\n\\text{Initial total number of fruits} = 7 + 8 + 15 = 30\n\\]\nSo, the remaining number of fruits in the bag is:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining number of fruits} = 30 - 16 = 14\n\\]\n\nThus, the remaining number of fruits in the bag is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
