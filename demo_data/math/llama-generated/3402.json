The four guards agreed to a rotating schedule to cover the nine hours of the night shift. The first guard would take three hours since they were still awake, the last guard would wake up early and take two hours, and the middle two guards would split the remaining hours. How many hours will each middle guard take?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The first guard takes 3 hours, and the last guard takes 2 hours. Therefore, the remaining hours to be covered by the two middle guards are calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ 9 - 3 - 2 = 4 \\]\n\nSince the middle two guards will split the remaining 4 hours equally, each middle guard will take:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\]\n\nThus, each middle guard will take \\(\\boxed{2}\\) hours.",
        "To determine how many hours each middle guard will take, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total hours remaining after the first and last guards have worked:**\n   - The first guard takes 3 hours.\n   - The last guard takes 2 hours.\n   - The total shift is 9 hours.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining hours} = 9 - 3 - 2\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining hours} = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many hours each middle guard will take:**\n   - There are 2 middle guards.\n   - The remaining hours are 4.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hours per middle guard} = \\frac{4}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hours per middle guard} = 2\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each middle guard will take \\boxed{2} hours."
