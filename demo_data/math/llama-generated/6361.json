        "To determine how long it will take for Tom's rabbit to catch up to his cat, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the head start distance of the cat:**\n   The cat runs at 20 miles per hour and gets a 15-minute head start. First, convert 15 minutes to hours:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{15}{60} \\text{ hours} = 0.25 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   Now, calculate the distance the cat covers in 0.25 hours:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 20 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 0.25 \\text{ hours} = 5 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the relative speed between the rabbit and the cat:**\n   The rabbit runs at 25 miles per hour, and the cat runs at 20 miles per hour. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Relative speed} = 25 \\text{ miles per hour} - 20 \\text{ miles per hour} = 5 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time it takes for the rabbit to catch up:**\n   The rabbit needs to cover the 5-mile head start distance at a relative speed of 5 miles per hour. The time required is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Relative speed}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ miles}}{5 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take the rabbit \\(\\boxed{1}\\) hour to catch up to the cat.",

Calculate the time it takes for the rabbit to cover the head start distance.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the head start distance the cat has. The cat gets a 15-minute head start, and it runs at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Since 15 minutes is \\( \\frac{15}{60} = \\frac{1}{4} \\) hours, the head start distance is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ hours} = 5 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the relative speed of the rabbit compared to the cat. The rabbit runs at 25 miles per hour, and the cat runs at 20 miles per hour. Therefore, the rabbit is running 25 - 20 = 5 miles per hour faster than the cat. This means the rabbit is closing the gap at a rate of 5 miles per hour.\n\nTo find out how long it will take for the rabbit to cover the 5-mile head start distance, we divide the head start distance by the relative speed:\n\\[\n\\frac{5 \\text{ miles}}{5 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n\\]\n\nSo, it will take the rabbit \\(\\boxed{1}\\) hour to catch up to the cat.",
