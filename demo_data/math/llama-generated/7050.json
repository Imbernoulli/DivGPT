        "To determine how many boys were absent that day, we start by defining the variables and using the information given in the problem.\n\n1. Let \\( B \\) be the number of boys in the class.\n2. The total number of students in the class is 250, and there are 140 girls. Therefore, the number of boys in the class is:\n   \\[\n   B = 250 - 140 = 110\n   \\]\n\n3. On the day in question, all 140 girls were present. Let \\( x \\) be the number of boys present. According to the problem, there were twice as many girls as boys present:\n   \\[\n   140 = 2x\n   \\]\n\n4. Solving for \\( x \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{140}{2} = 70\n   \\]\n\n5. Since there are 110 boys in total and 70 boys were present, the number of boys absent is:\n   \\[\n   110 - 70 = 40\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of boys absent that day is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
