        "To determine how many grams of sugar are in one cupcake, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define the amount of sugar used for one dozen cupcakes as \\( x \\) grams.

Therefore, the two layers of the cake together use \\( 2x \\) grams of sugar.\n\nThe total amount of sugar used for the cake and the cupcakes is given as 720 grams. So, we can set up the following equation to represent the total sugar usage:\n\\[\n2x + x = 720\n\\]\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\n3x = 720\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{720}{3} = 240\n\\]\nThis means that each dozen cupcakes uses 240 grams of sugar.
