Therefore, calculate his total earnings:\n\\[\n70 \\text{ questions} \\times 0.2 \\text{ dollars/question} = 14 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Bart earned during these two days is \\boxed{14}.",
        "To determine how much money Bart earned over the two days, we need to calculate his earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Bart's earnings for Monday:\n- Each survey has 10 questions.\n- Bart earns $0.2 for each question.\n- Therefore, Bart earns \\(10 \\times 0.2 = 2\\) dollars for each survey.\n- On Monday, Bart completed 3 surveys.\n- So, his earnings for Monday are \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate Bart's earnings for Tuesday:\n- Each survey has 10 questions.\n- Bart earns $0.2 for each question.\n- Therefore, Bart earns \\(10 \\times 0.2 = 2\\) dollars for each survey.\n- On Tuesday, Bart completed 4 surveys.\n- So, his earnings for Tuesday are \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we sum up his earnings for both days:\n- Earnings for Monday: $6\n- Earnings for Tuesday: $8\n- Total earnings: \\(6 + 8 = 14\\) dollars.\n\nThus, Bart earned \\(\\boxed{14}\\) dollars during these two days.",
