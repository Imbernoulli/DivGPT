        "To determine the height difference between Bella and Anne's sister, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the height of Anne's sister.\n2. Identify the height of Bella.\n3. Calculate the height difference between Bella and Anne's sister.\n\nFirst, we know that Anne is 80 cm tall and she is 2 times as tall as her sister. Therefore, we can find the height of Anne's sister by dividing Anne's height by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Height of Anne's sister} = \\frac{80 \\text{ cm}}{2} = 40 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Bella is 3 times as tall as Anne. Therefore, we can find the height of Bella by multiplying Anne's height by 3:\n\\[\n\\text{Height of Bella} = 80 \\text{ cm} \\times 3 = 240 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the height difference between Bella and Anne's sister. We do this by subtracting the height of Anne's sister from the height of Bella:\n\\[\n\\text{Height difference} = 240 \\text{ cm} - 40 \\text{ cm} = 200 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nThus, the height difference between Bella and Anne's sister is \\boxed{200}."
