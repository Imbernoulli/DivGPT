        "To determine how much Carla pays for her order at McDonald's after applying the coupon and the senior citizen discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the price after applying the coupon:**\n   The original cost of the order is $7.50, and Carla has a coupon for $2.50.\n   \\[\n   7.50 - 2.50 = 5.00\n   \\]\n   So, the price after applying the coupon is $5.00.\n\n2. **Calculate the price after applying the senior citizen discount:**\n   The senior citizen discount is 20%. To find out how much the discount is in dollars, we multiply the price after the coupon by 20% (or 0.20).\n   \\[\n   5.00 \\times 0.20 = 1.00\n   \\]\n   So, the discount is $1.00. To find the final price, we subtract the discount from the price after the coupon.\n   \\[\n   5.00 - 1.00 = 4.00\n   \\]\n   So, the final price Carla pays for her order is $4.00.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Carla pays for her order is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
