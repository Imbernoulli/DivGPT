        "To determine the total of August's answers from solving the three math problems, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the answer to the first math problem.\n2.

The answer is given as 600.\n\nNext, we calculate the answer to the second math problem. The second problem has an answer twice as big as the answer of the first math problem. Therefore, we multiply the answer of the first problem by 2:\n\\[ 2 \\times 600 = 1200 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the answer to the third math problem. The third problem has an answer that is 400 less than the combined total answers of the first and the second math problems. First, we find the combined total answers of the first and the second problems:\n\\[ 600 + 1200 = 1800 \\]\nThen, we subtract 400 from this total:\n\\[ 1800 - 400 = 1400 \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the answers of all three math problems:\n\\[ 600 + 1200 + 1400 = 3200 \\]\n\nThus, the total of August's answers from solving the three math problems on his calculator is \\(\\boxed{3200}\\).",

Determine the answer to the third math problem.\n3. Add the answers to all three math problems.\n\nFirst, we know the answer to the first math problem is 600. The second math problem has an answer that is twice as big as the answer of the first math problem. Therefore, we calculate the answer to the second math problem as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 600 = 1200 \\]\n\nNext, the third math problem has an answer that is 400 less than the combined total answers of the first and the second math problems. First, we find the combined total of the answers of the first and second math problems:\n\\[ 600 + 1200 = 1800 \\]\nThen, we subtract 400 from this total to get the answer to the third math problem:\n\\[ 1800 - 400 = 1400 \\]\n\nNow, we add the answers to all three math problems to find the total:\n\\[ 600 + 1200 + 1400 = 3200 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total of August's answers from solving the three math problems on his calculator is \\(\\boxed{3200}\\).",
        "To determine the total of August's answers from solving the three math problems, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **First Math Problem:**\n   The answer to the first math problem is given as:\n   \\[\n   a_1 = 600\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Math Problem:**\n   The answer to the second math problem is twice as big as the answer of the first math problem:\n   \\[\n   a_2 = 2 \\times a_1 = 2 \\times 600 = 1200\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Math Problem:**\n   The answer to the third math problem is 400 less than the combined total answers of the first and the second math problems. First, we calculate the combined total of the first and second answers:\n   \\[\n   a_1 + a_2 = 600 + 1200 = 1800\n   \\]\n   Then, we subtract 400 from this sum to find the answer to the third problem:\n   \\[\n   a_3 = 1800 - 400 = 1400\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total of All Answers:**\n   Finally, we add up the answers to all three math problems:\n   \\[\n   a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 600 + 1200 + 1400 = 3200\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total of August's answers from solving the three math problems on his calculator is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3200}\n\\]"
