His tall cupboard can hold 20 glasses, his wide cupboard can hold twice as many, and his narrow cupboard can hold 15 glasses with the glasses divided equally among the three shelves. As Damien is putting glasses in the narrow cupboard, he accidentally breaks one of the shelves. If all of the cupboards are full, how many glasses are currently being displayed?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total number of glasses currently being displayed, we need to calculate the capacity of each cupboard and then account for the broken shelf in the narrow cupboard.\n\nFirst, let's find the capacity of each cupboard:\n- The tall cupboard can hold 20 glasses.\n- The wide cupboard can hold twice as many glasses as the tall cupboard, so it can hold \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) glasses.\n- The narrow cupboard can hold 15 glasses with the glasses divided equally among the three shelves. Therefore, each shelf can hold \\(\\frac{15}{3} = 5\\) glasses. Since one shelf is broken, the narrow cupboard can now hold \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) glasses.\n\nNext, we add the capacities of all the cupboards together:\n- The tall cupboard holds 20 glasses.\n- The wide cupboard holds 40 glasses.\n- The narrow cupboard holds 10 glasses.\n\nSo, the total number of glasses currently being displayed is:\n\\[20 + 40 + 10 = 70\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",
