She bought two cheesecakes, an apple pie, and a six-pack of muffins. The six-pack of muffins was two times more expensive than the cheesecake, and one cheesecake was only 25% cheaper than the apple pie.

        "To determine the total cost of Natalie's shopping, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up. Let's start with the given information and work step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of the apple pie**: The apple pie costs $12.\n2. **Cost of one cheesecake**: Since one cheesecake is 25% cheaper than the apple pie, we can calculate the cost of one cheesecake as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one cheesecake} = 12 - 0.25 \\times 12 = 12 - 3 = 9\n   \\]\n   So, each cheesecake costs $9.\n3. **Cost of the six-pack of muffins**: The six-pack of muffins is two times more expensive than one cheesecake. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the six-pack of muffins as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of the six-pack of muffins} = 2 \\times 9 = 18\n   \\]\n   So, the six-pack of muffins costs $18.\n4. **Total cost of two cheesecakes**: Since each cheesecake costs $9, the total cost for two cheesecakes is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of two cheesecakes} = 2 \\times 9 = 18\n   \\]\n5. **Total cost of all the items**: Now, we sum up the costs of the two cheesecakes, the apple pie, and the six-pack of muffins:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 18 + 12 + 18 = 48\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Natalie paid for all her shopping is \\(\\boxed{48}\\).",

        "To determine the total cost of Natalie's shopping, we need to find the cost of each item she bought and then sum these costs. We know the following:\n\n1. The apple pie cost $12.\n2. One cheesecake was 25% cheaper than the apple pie.\n3. The six-pack of muffins was two times more expensive than one cheesecake.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of one cheesecake. Since one cheesecake is 25% cheaper than the apple pie, we can find its cost by subtracting 25% of the apple pie's cost from the apple pie's cost. The apple pie costs $12, so 25% of $12 is:\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 12 = 3 \\]\nTherefore, the cost of one cheesecake is:\n\\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the six-pack of muffins. Since the six-pack of muffins is two times more expensive than one cheesecake, we can find its cost by multiplying the cost of one cheesecake by 2. The cost of one cheesecake is $9, so the cost of the six-pack of muffins is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 9 = 18 \\]\n\nNow, we can sum the costs of all the items Natalie bought. She bought two cheesecakes, one apple pie, and one six-pack of muffins. The cost of two cheesecakes is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 9 = 18 \\]\nThe cost of one apple pie is $12, and the cost of one six-pack of muffins is $18. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 18 + 12 + 18 = 48 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount Natalie paid for all her shopping is:\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of the Apple Pie:**\n   The apple pie costs $12.\n\n2. **Cost of One Cheesecake:**\n   One cheesecake is 25% cheaper than the apple pie. To find the cost of one cheesecake, we calculate 25% of the cost of the apple pie and subtract it from the original price.\n   \\[\n   25\\% \\text{ of } \\$12 = 0.25 \\times 12 = \\$3\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the cost of one cheesecake is:\n   \\[\n   \\$12 - \\$3 = \\$9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of Two Cheesecakes:**\n   Since each cheesecake costs $9, the cost of two cheesecakes is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 9 = \\$18\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cost of the Six-Pack of Muffins:**\n   The six-pack of muffins is two times more expensive than one cheesecake. Therefore, the cost of the six-pack of muffins is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 9 = \\$18\n   \\]\n\n5. **Total Cost of All Items:**\n   Now, we add up the costs of all the items Natalie bought:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of two cheesecakes} + \\text{Cost of one apple pie} + \\text{Cost of six-pack of muffins}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\$18 + \\$12 + \\$18 = \\$48\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Natalie paid for all her shopping is \\(\\boxed{48}\\).",
        "To determine the total cost of Natalie's shopping, we need to find the cost of each item she bought and then sum these costs.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of one cheesecake. We know that one cheesecake is 25% cheaper than the apple pie. The apple pie costs $12, so we calculate the cost of one cheesecake as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of one cheesecake} = 12 - (0.25 \\times 12) = 12 - 3 = 9\n\\]\nSo, one cheesecake costs $9.\n\nNext, we know that the six-pack of muffins is two times more expensive than one cheesecake.

        "To determine the total cost of Natalie's shopping, we need to find the cost of each item she bought and then sum these costs. Let's start by identifying the cost of each item based on the given information.\n\n1. **Cost of the apple pie:**\n   The apple pie costs $12.\n\n2. **Cost of one cheesecake:**\n   One cheesecake is 25% cheaper than the apple pie. To find the cost of one cheesecake, we calculate 25% of the apple pie's cost and subtract it from the apple pie's cost.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one cheesecake} = 12 - 0.25 \\times 12 = 12 - 3 = 9\n   \\]\n   So, one cheesecake costs $9.\n\n3. **Cost of the six-pack of muffins:**\n   The six-pack of muffins is two times more expensive than one cheesecake. To find the cost of the six-pack of muffins, we multiply the cost of one cheesecake by 2.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of the six-pack of muffins} = 2 \\times 9 = 18\n   \\]\n   So, the six-pack of muffins costs $18.\n\n4. **Total cost of two cheesecakes:**\n   Since one cheesecake costs $9, the cost of two cheesecakes is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of two cheesecakes} = 2 \\times 9 = 18\n   \\]\n\n5. **Total cost of all the items:**\n   To find the total cost of all the items, we add the cost of the two cheesecakes, the apple pie, and the six-pack of muffins.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 18 + 12 + 18 = 48\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Natalie paid for all her shopping is \\(\\boxed{48}\\).",
