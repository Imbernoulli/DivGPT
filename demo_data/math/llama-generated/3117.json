        "To determine Ben's gross monthly income, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Ben's after-tax income based on his car payment.\n2. Determine how much Ben pays in taxes and how much is his after-tax income.\n3. Find Ben's gross monthly income.\n\nFirst, we know that Ben spends 20% of his after-tax income on his car. Given that his car payment is $400, we can set up the following equation to find his after-tax income:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times \\text{After-tax income} = 400\n\\]\nSolving for the after-tax income, we divide both sides by 0.20:\n\\[\n\\text{After-tax income} = \\frac{400}{0.20} = 2000\n\\]\nSo, Ben's after-tax income is $2000 per month.\n\nNext, we know that Ben pays \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of his gross income in taxes. Therefore, his after-tax income is the remaining \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of his gross income. Let \\(G\\) be Ben's gross monthly income. Then:\n\\[\n\\text{After-tax income} = G - \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times G\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}G\n\\]\nWe already know that the after-tax income is $2000, so we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3}G = 2000\n\\]\nTo find \\(G\\), we multiply both sides by \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\):\n\\[\nG = 2000 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 3000\n\\]\nSo, Ben's gross monthly income is \\(\\boxed{3000}\\).",
