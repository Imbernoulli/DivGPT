Therefore, the number of students in the fourth-level math class is:\n\\[ 4x = 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\]\n\nThe number of students in Ms. Cole's seventh-level math class is twice the number of students in her fourth-level math class. Therefore, the number of students in the seventh-level math class is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 160 = 320 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of students in all three levels to find the total number of math students Ms. Cole teaches:\n\\[ 40 + 160 + 320 = 520 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of math students Ms. Cole teaches is:\n\\[ \\boxed{520} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of math students Ms. Cole teaches, we need to find the number of students in each of her three classes and then sum these numbers.\n\n1. **Sixth-level math class:**\n   - Given: 40 students\n\n2. **Fourth-level math class:**\n   - There are four times as many students in the fourth-level class as in the sixth-level class.\n   - Calculation: \\( 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\) students\n\n3. **Seventh-level math class:**\n   - There are twice as many students in the seventh-level class as in the fourth-level class.\n   - Calculation: \\( 2 \\times 160 = 320 \\) students\n\n4. **Total number of students:**\n   - Sum the students in all three classes: \\( 40 + 160 + 320 \\)\n   - Calculation: \\( 40 + 160 = 200 \\)\n   - Calculation: \\( 200 + 320 = 520 \\)\n\nTherefore, the total number of math students Ms. Cole teaches is \\(\\boxed{520}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of math students Ms. Cole teaches, we start by identifying the number of students in each level of class based on the information given.\n\n1. Let the number of students in Ms. Cole's sixth-level math class be \\( S_6 \\).\n2.
