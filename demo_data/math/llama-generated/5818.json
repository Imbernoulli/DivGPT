Calculate the number of tasks Jerry completes in one week.\n3. Calculate his total earnings for the week based on the number of tasks completed and the payment per task.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many tasks Jerry completes in one day. Since each task takes him 2 hours to complete and he works 10 hours a day, we divide the total hours he works in a day by the hours it takes to complete one task:\n\\[\n\\text{ alternatives per day} = \\frac{10 \\text{ hours}}{2 \\text{ hours per task}} = 5 \\text{ tasks per day}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many tasks Jerry completes in one week.
