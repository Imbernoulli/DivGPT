        "To determine the total number of episodes in the show \"Magic King,\" we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.\n\n1. **Identify the number of seasons in each half:**\n   - The show was on the air for 10 seasons.\n   - The first half consists of the first 5 seasons.\n   - The second half consists of the last 5 seasons.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of episodes for the first half:**\n   - Each season in the first half has 20 episodes.\n   - Number of seasons in the first half: 5.\n   - Total episodes in the first half: \\( 5 \\times 20 = 100 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of episodes for the second half:**\n   - Each season in the second half has 25 episodes.\n   - Number of seasons in the second half: 5.\n   - Total episodes in the second half: \\( 5 \\times 25 = 125 \\).\n\n4. **Sum the total episodes from both halves:**\n   - Total episodes in the first half: 100.\n   - Total episodes in the second half: 125.\n   - Total episodes for the entire show: \\( 100 + 125 = 225 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of episodes in the show \"Magic King\" is \\(\\boxed{225}\\).",
