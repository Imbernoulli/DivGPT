        "To determine the age difference between Milena and her grandfather, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Milena's grandmother's age.\n2. Calculate Milena's grandfather's age.\n3. Find the age difference between Milena and her grandfather.\n\nFirst, we know that Milena is 7 years old and her grandmother is 9 times older than her. Therefore, we can calculate her grandmother's age as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Grandmother's age} = 9 \\times 7 = 63\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Milena's grandfather is two years older than her grandmother. Therefore, we can calculate her grandfather's age as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Grandfather's age} = 63 + 2 = 65\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the age difference between Milena and her grandfather. This can be calculated by subtracting Milena's age from her grandfather's age:\n\\[\n\\text{Age difference} = 65 - 7 = 58\n\\]\n\nThus, the age difference between Milena and her grandfather is \\boxed{58}.",
