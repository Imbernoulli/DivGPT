        "To determine how many people the city's bus system carries over 13 weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\nFirst, we find out how many days are in 13 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 13 by 7:\n\\[ 13 \\times 7 = 91 \\]\nSo, there are 91 days in 13 weeks.\n\nNext, we know that the bus system carries 1,200,000 people each day. To find out how many people it carries in 91 days, we multiply the number of people carried each day by the number of days:\n\\[ 1,200,000 \\times 91 \\]\n\nTo make the multiplication easier, we can break it down:\n\\[ 1,200,000 \\times 91 = 1,200,000 \\times (90 + 1) = (1,200,000 \\times 90) + (1,200,000 \\times 1) \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 1,200,000 \\times 90 \\):\n\\[ 1,200,000 \\times 90 = 1,200,000 \\times 9 \\times 10 = 10,800,000 \\times 10 = 108,000,000 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 1,200,000 \\times 1 \\):\n\\[ 1,200,000 \\times 1 = 1,200,000 \\]\n\nNow, we add the two results together:\n\\[ 108,000,000 + 1,200,000 = 109,200,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the bus system carries \\(\\boxed{109200000}\\) people over 13 weeks.",
