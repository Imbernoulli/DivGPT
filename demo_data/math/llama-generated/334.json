        "To determine how many sheets of paper Justine used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of sheets per binder:**\n   The total number of sheets of paper is 2450, and they are evenly split into 5 binders. Therefore, we divide the total number of sheets by the number of binders:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2450}{5} = 490\n   \\]\n   So, each binder contains 490 sheets of paper.\n\n2. **Determine the number of sheets Justine used:**\n   Justine took one binder and colored on one-half of the sheets in that binder. Therefore, we need to find half of the 490 sheets:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{490}{2} = 245\n   \\]\n   So, Justine used 245 sheets of paper.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{245}\n\\]",

        "To determine how many sheets of paper Justine used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of sheets per binder:**\n   - There are 2450 sheets of paper in total.\n   - These sheets are evenly split into 5 binders.\n   - Therefore, the number of sheets per binder is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2450 \\text{ sheets}}{5 \\text{ binders}} = 490 \\text{ sheets per binder}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many sheets Justine colored:**\n   - Justine took one binder.\n   - She colored on one-half of the sheets in that binder.\n   - Therefore, the number of sheets she colored is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{490 \\text{ sheets}}{2} = 245 \\text{ sheets}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of sheets of paper Justine used is \\(\\boxed{245}\\).",
