        "To determine how much money Liam will have left after paying his bills, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Liam has saved.\n2. Subtract the cost of his bills from his savings.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Liam has saved. He has been saving $500 per month for 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in 2 years is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nNow, we multiply the number of months by the amount he saves each month:\n\\[ 24 \\times 500 = 12000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, Liam has saved $12,000.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the cost of his bills from his savings. The cost of his bills is $3,500. Therefore, we perform the following subtraction:\n\\[ 12000 - 3500 = 8500 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, after paying his bills, Liam will have \\(\\boxed{8500}\\) dollars left.",
