        "To determine how much money Toby has left after sharing with his two brothers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much money each brother receives.\n2. Calculate the total amount of money given to both brothers.\n3. Subtract the total amount given to the brothers from the original amount of money Toby received.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much money each brother receives. Toby gives each brother \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) of $343. Therefore, we need to divide $343 by 7:\n\\[\n\\frac{343}{7} = 49\n\\]\nSo, each brother receives $49.\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of money given to both brothers. Since Toby has two brothers, we multiply the amount each brother receives by 2:\n\\[\n49 \\times 2 = 98\n\\]\nSo, Toby gives a total of $98 to his two brothers.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount given to the brothers from the original amount of money Toby received:\n\\[\n343 - 98 = 245\n\\]\nSo, the amount of money left for Toby is \\(\\boxed{245}\\).",

Since Toby has two brothers, we multiply the amount each brother receives by 2:\n\\[\n49 \\times 2 = 98\n\\]\nSo, Toby gives a total of $98 to his two brothers.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount given to the brothers from the original amount of money Toby received:\n\\[\n343 - 98 = 245\n\\]\nSo, the amount of money left for Toby is \\(\\boxed{245}\\).",
