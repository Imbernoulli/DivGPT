        "To determine the total amount of food Peter needs to feed his horses for 3 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily food consumption for one horse. Each horse eats 4 pounds of oats twice a day and 3 pounds of grain once a day. So, the daily consumption of oats for one horse is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ pounds/meal} \\times 2 \\text{ meals/day} = 8 \\text{ pounds/day} \\]\nThe daily consumption of grain for one horse is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ pounds/day} \\]\nTherefore, the total daily food consumption for one horse is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ pounds/day} + 3 \\text{ pounds/day} = 11 \\text{ pounds/day} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total daily food consumption for all four horses. Since each horse consumes 11 pounds of food per day, the total daily consumption for four horses is:\n\\[ 11 \\text{ pounds/day/horse} \\times 4 \\text{ horses} = 44 \\text{ pounds/day} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total food consumption for 3 days. Since the four horses consume 44 pounds of food per day, the total food consumption for 3 days is:\n\\[ 44 \\text{ pounds/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 132 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of food Peter needs to feed his horses for 3 days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{132} \\]",
