        "To determine the total number of balls in the fish tank, we need to calculate the number of red balls and the number of white balls separately, and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of red balls. Each goldfish plays with ten red balls, and there are three goldfish. Therefore, the total number of red balls is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ goldfish} \\times 10 \\text{ red balls per goldfish} = 30 \\text{ red balls} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of white balls. Each platyfish plays with five white balls, and there are ten platyfish. Therefore, the total number of white balls is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ platyfish} \\times 5 \\text{ white balls per platyfish} = 50 \\text{ white balls} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of red balls and the number of white balls to find the total number of balls in the fish tank:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ red balls} + 50 \\text{ white balls} = 80 \\text{ balls} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of balls in the fish tank is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
