        "To determine the total number of hours James trains in a year, we need to break down his training schedule step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of days James trains in a week. He trains every day except for 2 days, so he trains:\n\\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \\text{ days per week} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours he trains each day. He trains twice a day for 4 hours each time, so he trains:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ hours per day} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of hours he trains in a week by multiplying the number of days he trains by the number of hours he trains each day:\n\\[ 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\text{ hours per week} \\]\n\nTo find the total number of hours he trains in a year, we multiply the number of hours he trains per week by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):\n\\[ 40 \\times 52 = 2080 \\text{ hours per year} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours James trains in a year is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2080} \\]",
