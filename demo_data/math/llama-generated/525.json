        "To determine how many judges are over 50 years old, we start by calculating the number of judges in each age group.\n\nFirst, we find the number of judges under 30 years old. Since 10 percent of the judges are under 30 years old, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.10 \\times 40 = 4\n\\]\nSo, there are 4 judges under 30 years old.\n\nNext, we find the number of judges between 30 and 50 years old. Since 60 percent of the judges are between 30 and 50 years old, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.60 \\times 40 = 24\n\\]\nSo, there are 24 judges between 30 and 50 years old.\n\nThe rest of the judges are over 50 years old. To find the number of judges over 50 years old, we subtract the number of judges under 30 years old and the number of judges between 30 and 50 years old from the total number of judges:\n\\[\n40 - 4 - 24 = 12\n\\]\nSo, there are 12 judges over 50 years old.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",

Calculate the number of judges under 30 years old:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of judges under 30 years old} = 10\\% \\text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \\times 40 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of judges aged 30-50 years old:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of judges aged 30-50 years old} = 60\\% \\text{ of } 40 = 0.60 \\times 40 = 24\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract the sum of the judges under 30 years old and those aged 30-50 years old from the total number of judges to find the number of judges over 50 years old:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of judges over 50 years old} = 40 - (\\text{Number of judges under 30 years old} + \\text{Number of judges aged 30-50 years old}) = 40 - (4 + 24) = 40 - 28 = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of judges over 50 years old is \\boxed{12}.",

Calculate the number of judges who are 30-50 years old.\n3. Subtract the sum of the judges under 30 and 30-50 from the total number of judges to find the number of judges over 50.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of judges who are under 30 years old. Since 10% of the judges are under 30, we can find this number by multiplying the total number of judges by 10%.\n\n\\[\n0.10 \\times 40 = 4\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 4 judges who are under 30 years old.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of judges who are 30-50 years old.
