        "To determine the total cost of the ice cream that the Martin family gets, we need to calculate the cost for each type of scoop separately and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. Calculate the cost for Mr. and Mrs. Martin:\n   - Each gets a regular scoop, which costs $4.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for Mr. and Mrs. Martin is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. Calculate the cost for the two children:\n   - Each gets a kiddie scoop, which costs $3.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the two children is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. Calculate the cost for the three teenage children:\n   - Each gets a double scoop, which costs $6.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the three teenage children is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 6 = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. Add the costs for Mr. and Mrs. Martin, the two children, and the three teenage children to get the total amount of money Mrs. Martin pays the cashier:\n   \\[\n   8 + 6 + 18 = 32 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Mrs. Martin pays the cashier is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
