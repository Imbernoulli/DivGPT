Ked needs half of the number of eggs needed by Ben. Since Ben needs 14 eggs per week, Ked needs:\n\\[ \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\text{ eggs per week} \\]\n\nNext, we sum the weekly egg needs for Saly, Ben, and Ked:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ (Saly)} + 14 \\text{ (Ben)} + 7 \\text{ (Ked)} = 31 \\text{ eggs per week} \\]\n\nSince the month has 4 weeks, we multiply the total weekly egg need by 4:\n\\[ 31 \\times 4 = 124 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nTherefore, Mcdonald's farm should produce \\(\\boxed{124}\\) eggs in a month.",
        "To determine the total number of eggs Mcdonald's farm should produce in a month, we need to calculate the weekly egg requirements for each person and then multiply by the number of weeks in a month.\n\nFirst, let's find the weekly egg requirements for each person:\n- Saly needs 10 eggs per week.\n- Ben needs 14 eggs per week.\n- Ked needs half of the number of eggs needed by Ben. Since Ben needs 14 eggs, Ked needs \\( \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\) eggs per week.\n\nNext, we calculate the total weekly egg requirement for all three people:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ (Saly's eggs)} + 14 \\text{ (Ben's eggs)} + 7 \\text{ (Ked's eggs)} = 31 \\text{ eggs per week} \\]\n\nSince there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4 to find the monthly total:\n\\[ 31 \\text{ eggs per week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 124 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nTherefore, Mcdonald's farm should produce \\(\\boxed{124}\\) eggs in a month.",
