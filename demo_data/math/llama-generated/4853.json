        "To determine the present age of Allen's mother, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:\n\n- Let \\( A \\) be Allen's current age.\n- Let \\( M \\) be his mother's current age.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. Allen is 25 years younger than his mother.\n2. In 3 years, the sum of their ages will be 41.\n\nWe can express these two pieces of information as equations:\n1. \\( A = M - 25 \\)\n2. In 3 years, Allen's age will be \\( A + 3 \\) and his mother's age will be \\( M + 3 \\). Therefore, the sum of their ages in 3 years is \\( (A + 3) + (M + 3) = 41 \\).
