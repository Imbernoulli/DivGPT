        "To determine how many stickers Dan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.\n\n1. Identify the number of stickers Bob has:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bob's stickers} = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of stickers Tom has. According to the problem, Tom has 3 times as many stickers as Bob:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tom's stickers} = 3 \\times \\text{Bob's stickers} = 3 \\times 12 = 36\n   \\]\n\n3.
