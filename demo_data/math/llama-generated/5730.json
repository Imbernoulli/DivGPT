She bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs, and her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she had:\n\n\\[12 + 12 = 24\\]\n\nNext, Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake. The total number of eggs she used is:\n\n\\[2 + 4 = 6\\]\n\nAfter using these eggs, the number of eggs Megan had left is:\n\n\\[24 - 6 = 18\\]\n\nMegan then gave half of her remaining eggs to her aunt. The number of eggs she gave to her aunt is:\n\n\\[18 \\div 2 = 9\\]\n\nSo, the number of eggs Megan had left after giving half to her aunt is:\n\n\\[18 - 9 = 9\\]\n\nMegan plans to divide these 9 eggs equally for her next 3 meals. The number of eggs per meal is:\n\n\\[9 \\div 3 = 3\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of eggs per meal Megan would have is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{3}\\]",
