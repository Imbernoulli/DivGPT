        "To determine how much money Calvin has spent on chips after 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of days Calvin buys chips in one week.\n2. Calculate the number of days Calvin buys chips in 4 weeks.\n3. Calculate the total amount of money Calvin spends on chips in 4 weeks.\n\nFirst, we know that Calvin buys chips 5 days a week. Therefore, in one week, he spends:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ days/week} \\times \\$0.50/\\text{day} = \\$2.50/\\text{week} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much he spends in 4 weeks. So, we multiply the weekly cost by 4:\n\\[ \\$2.50/\\text{week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = \\$10.00 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Calvin has spent on chips after 4 weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",
        "To determine how much money Calvin has spent on chips after 4 weeks, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of days Calvin buys chips in one week. Since he buys chips 5 days a week, we have:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ days/week} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of days Calvin buys chips in 4 weeks. Since he buys chips 5 days each week, over 4 weeks he buys chips:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ days/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 20 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNow, we know that each pack of chips costs $0.50. Therefore, the total amount of money Calvin spends on chips over 20 days is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ days} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/day} = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of money Calvin has spent on chips after 4 weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",

Calculate the total cost of the chips over 4 weeks.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of days Calvin buys chips in one week.\nCalvin buys chips 5 days a week.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of days Calvin buys chips in 4 weeks.\nSince Calvin buys chips 5 days a week, in 4 weeks he buys chips:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ days/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 20 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total cost of the chips over 4 weeks.\nEach pack of chips costs $0.50, so the total cost for 20 days is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ days} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/day} = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Calvin has spent on chips after 4 weeks is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."
