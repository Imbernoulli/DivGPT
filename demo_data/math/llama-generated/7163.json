        "To determine how much Rose paid for the plant after the discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the original price of the plant, which is $10.\n2. Determine the discount amount. Since the discount is 10%, we calculate 10% of $10.\n3. Convert the percentage to a decimal for calculation purposes. 10% is equivalent to 0.10.\n4. Multiply the original price by the decimal form of the discount: $10 \\times 0.10 = $1.\n5. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price Rose paid: $10 - $1 = $9.\n\nTherefore, the amount Rose paid after the discount is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
