        "To determine how many marbles remain in Mr. Julien's store, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of marbles sold.\n2. Subtract the total number of marbles sold from the initial number of marbles remaining.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of marbles sold. There were 20 customers, and each bought 15 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles sold is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 15 = 300 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total number of marbles sold from the initial number of marbles remaining. The initial number of marbles remaining was 400. So, we have:\n\\[ 400 - 300 = 100 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles remaining in the store is:\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]",

Since each of the 20 customers bought 15 marbles, we multiply the number of customers by the number of marbles each customer bought:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of marbles sold} = 20 \\times 15 = 300 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of marbles sold from the initial number of marbles to find out how many marbles remain:\n\\[ \\text{Number of marbles remaining} = 400 - 300 = 100 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles remaining in the store is:\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]",
