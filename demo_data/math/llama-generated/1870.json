        "To determine the price of the television including a 15% value-added tax (VAT), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the original price of the TV, which is $1700.\n2. Calculate the amount of VAT by finding 15% of $1700.\n3. Add the VAT to the original price to get the final price.\n\nLet's go through the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the VAT:\n   \\[\n   \\text{VAT} = 15\\% \\text{ of } 1700 = 0.15 \\times 1700 = 255\n   \\]\n\n2. Add the VAT to the original price:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Price} = 1700 + 255 = 1955\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the price of the television when calculating 15% of the value-added tax is \\(\\boxed{1955}\\).",
