        "To determine how long it will take Jerry to fill his pond, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the reduced pumping rate of the hose due to drought restrictions.\n2. Determine how long it will take to fill the pond with the reduced pumping rate.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the reduced pumping rate of the hose. The hose's normal pumping rate is 6 gallons per minute, and due to drought restrictions, it can only pump at 2/3 of its normal speed. Therefore, the reduced pumping rate is:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ gallons/minute} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 4 \\text{ gallons/minute}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to fill the pond with the reduced pumping rate. The pond can hold 200 gallons of water, and the hose is pumping water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. So, the time required to fill the pond is:\n\\[\n\\frac{200 \\text{ gallons}}{4 \\text{ gallons/minute}} = 50 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jerry \\boxed{50} minutes to fill his pond.",

With a reduced pumping rate of 4 gallons per minute, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to pump 200 gallons. We do this by dividing the total capacity of the pond by the reduced pumping rate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time to fill the pond} = \\frac{200 \\text{ gallons}}{4 \\text{ gallons/minute}} = 50 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jerry \\(\\boxed{50}\\) minutes to fill his pond.",
