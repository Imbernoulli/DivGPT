        "To find the average points scored per player on the team, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the points scored by Righty.\n2. Determine the points scored by their other teammate.\n3. Calculate the total points scored by all three players.\n4. Divide the total points by the number of players to find the average.\n\nLet's start with the points scored by Righty. Righty scores half as many points as Lefty. Since Lefty scores 20 points, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Points scored by Righty} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\]\n\nNext, we determine the points scored by their other teammate. The other teammate scores 6 times as many points as Righty. Since Righty scores 10 points, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Points scored by their other teammate} = 6 \\times 10 = 60 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total points scored by all three players. The total points is the sum of the points scored by Lefty, Righty, and their other teammate:\n\\[ \\text{Total points} = 20 + 10 + 60 = 90 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the average points scored per player by dividing the total points by the number of players (which is 3):\n\\[ \\text{Average points per player} = \\frac{90}{3} = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, the average points scored per player on the team is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

Therefore, we calculate the other teammate's points as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Other teammate's points} = 6 \\times 10 = 60\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum up the points scored by all three players:\n\\[\n\\text{Total points} = \\text{Lefty's points} + \\text{Righty's points} + \\text{Other teammate's points} = 20 + 10 + 60 = 90\n\\]\n\nTo find the average points scored per player, we divide the total points by the number of players (which is 3):\n\\[\n\\text{Average points per player} = \\frac{90}{3} = 30\n\\]\n\nThus, the average points scored per player on the team is \\boxed{30}.",
        "To determine the average points scored per player on the team, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the points scored by Righty.\n2.
