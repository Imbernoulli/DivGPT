        "To determine how much money Jimmy and Irene give to the cashier, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of Jimmy's shorts.\n2. Calculate the total cost of Irene's shirts.\n3. Add the two amounts together.\n4. Apply the senior citizen discount (10%).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of Jimmy's shorts. Jimmy picks out 3 shorts from the $15 rack, so the total cost for Jimmy is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 15 = 45 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of Irene's shirts. Irene grabs 5 shirts from the $17 rack, so the total cost for Irene is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 17 = 85 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost before the discount:\n\\[ 45 + 85 = 130 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince they are shopping on a Tuesday and they are senior citizens, they get a 10% discount on their total purchase. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $130:\n\\[ 0.10 \\times 130 = 13 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSubtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much they give to the cashier:\n\\[ 130 - 13 = 117 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money they give to the cashier is:\n\\[ \\boxed{117} \\]",
