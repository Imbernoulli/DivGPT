        "To determine the number of blue butterflies Martha has, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.\n\nLet \\( y \\) represent the number of yellow butterflies.

According to the problem, Martha has twice as many blue butterflies as yellow butterflies, so the number of blue butterflies is \\( 2y \\).\n\nWe know the total number of butterflies in Martha's collection is 11, and she has 5 black butterflies. Therefore, the number of yellow and blue butterflies combined is:\n\\[ 11 - 5 = 6 \\]\n\nThis means that the sum of the yellow butterflies and blue butterflies is 6. We can write this as:\n\\[ y + 2y = 6 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 3y = 6 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( y \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ y = \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, Martha has 2 yellow butterflies. Since she has twice as many blue butterflies as yellow butterflies, the number of blue butterflies is:\n\\[ 2y = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of blue butterflies Martha has is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
