        "To determine the total number of pieces of fruit in the fruit basket, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Count the oranges:**\n   There are 6 oranges.\n\n2. **Determine the number of apples:**\n   There are 2 fewer apples than oranges. Therefore, the number of apples is:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2 = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of bananas:**\n   There are 3 times as many bananas as apples.
