Calculate the percentage of unblocked ads that are not interesting.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Hannah's AdBlock blocks all but 20% of the ads. This means that 80% of the ads are blocked and 20% of the ads are not blocked.\n\nNext, we know that 20% of the unblocked ads are interesting. Therefore, the percentage of unblocked ads that are interesting is:\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } 20\\% = 0.20 \\times 0.20 = 0.04 = 4\\% \\]\n\nSince 4% of the ads are unblocked and interesting, the remaining unblocked ads are not interesting. The percentage of unblocked ads that are not interesting is:\n\\[ 20\\% - 4\\% = 16\\% \\]\n\nThus, the percentage of ads that aren't interesting and don't get blocked is:\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]",
