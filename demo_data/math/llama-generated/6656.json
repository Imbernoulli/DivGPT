        "To determine Jim's current age and then find out how old he will be in 2 years, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Tom's current age:**\n   Tom turned 32 years old 5 years ago. Therefore, his current age is:\n   \\[\n   32 + 5 = 37 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Tom's age 7 years ago:**\n   Since Tom is currently 37 years old, 7 years ago he was:\n   \\[\n   37 - 7 = 30 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Jim's age 7 years ago:**\n   According to the problem, 7 years ago Jim was 5 years older than half of Tom's age at that time. First, calculate half of Tom's age 7 years ago:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n   Jim was 5 years older than this age, so his age 7 years ago was:\n   \\[\n   15 + 5 = 20 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine Jim's current age:**\n   Since Jim was 20 years old 7 years ago, his current age is:\n   \\[\n   20 + 7 = 27 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine Jim's age in 2 years:**\n   Jim is currently 27 years old, so in 2 years he will be:\n   \\[\n   27 + 2 = 29 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jim will be \\boxed{29} years old in 2 years.",
