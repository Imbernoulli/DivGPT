        "To determine the total number of pieces of fried chicken Pau will have eaten, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pieces of fried chicken Pau initially ordered.\n2. Determine the number of pieces of fried chicken Pau ordered after they order another set.\n3. Add the initial amount ordered to the amount ordered after the additional set.\n\nFirst, we know that Kobe ordered 5 pieces of fried chicken. Since Pau ordered twice as much fried chicken as Kobe did, we calculate the initial amount Pau ordered as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\nSo, Pau initially ordered 10 pieces of fried chicken.\n\nNext, they order another set of fried chicken, which we assume is the same amount as the initial set Pau ordered, which is 10 pieces. Therefore, after ordering the additional set, Pau will have ordered:\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\nSo, Pau will have eaten a total of 20 pieces of fried chicken.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",

Since Pau ordered twice as much fried chicken as Kobe, we calculate the number of pieces Pau ordered as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 5 = 10\n\\]\nSo, Pau initially ordered 10 pieces of fried chicken.\n\nNext, we are told that they order another set of fried chicken. Since the problem does not specify the number of pieces in this additional set, we will assume it is another 10 pieces (the same amount Pau initially ordered). Therefore, after ordering another set, Pau will have eaten:\n\\[\n10 + 10 = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of pieces of fried chicken Pau will have eaten is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",

Sum up the pieces of fried chicken Pau ordered initially and the pieces from the additional set.\n\nFirst, we know that Kobe ordered 5 pieces of fried chicken.

Therefore, after ordering another set, Pau will have:\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\nSo, Pau will have eaten 20 pieces of fried chicken in all.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",

Since the problem does not specify how many pieces were in the additional set, we will assume that the additional set is the same as the initial set that Pau ordered, which is 10 pieces. Therefore, Pau will order another 10 pieces of fried chicken.\n\nTo find out how many pieces of fried chicken Pau will have eaten in all, we add the initial amount he ordered to the additional amount he ordered:\n\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pieces of fried chicken Pau will have eaten is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",

Since the problem does not specify the number of pieces in a set, we will assume they order the same amount as they initially ordered. Therefore, they will order another 10 pieces of fried chicken.\n\nSince Pau will eat the entire set of 10 pieces of fried chicken, we add this to the initial 10 pieces he ordered:\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pieces of fried chicken that Pau will have eaten is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",

Since Pau ordered twice as much fried chicken as Kobe did, we calculate:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\nSo, Pau initially ordered 10 pieces of fried chicken.\n\nNext, if they order another set of fried chicken, we need to assume that this set is the same size as the initial order Pau made. Therefore, Pau will order another 10 pieces of fried chicken.\n\nTo find the total number of pieces of fried chicken Pau will have eaten, we add the pieces from the initial order and the additional order:\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pieces of fried chicken Pau will have eaten in all is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

Since Pau ordered twice as much fried chicken as Kobe did, we can calculate the number of pieces Pau initially ordered as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\nSo, Pau initially ordered 10 pieces of fried chicken.\n\nNext, they order another set of fried chicken. Since the problem does not specify the number of pieces in this set, we will assume it is the same as the initial set Pau ordered, which is 10 pieces. Therefore, after ordering another set, the total number of pieces of fried chicken Pau has eaten is:\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pieces of fried chicken Pau has eaten in all is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
        "First, we determine how many pieces of fried chicken Pau initially ordered. Since Pau ordered twice as much fried chicken as Kobe, and Kobe ordered 5 pieces, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Pau initially ordered 10 pieces of fried chicken. If they order another set of fried chicken, and assuming this set is the same size as Pau's initial order (10 pieces), we add this to the 10 pieces Pau already ate:\n\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pieces of fried chicken Pau will have eaten in all is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
