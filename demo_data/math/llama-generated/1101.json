        "To determine how many cups each girl brought, we start by confirming the number of boys and girls in Ms. Leech's class.

According to the problem, we have:\n\\[ B = 10 \\]\n\\[ G = 2B = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we know that each boy brought 5 cups for the science activity class. Since there are 10 boys, the total number of cups brought by the boys is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\]\n\nThe total number of cups brought by all the students is 90. Therefore, the total number of cups brought by the girls is:\n\\[ 90 - 50 = 40 \\]\n\nSince there are 20 girls, the number of cups each girl brought is:\n\\[ \\frac{40}{20} = 2 \\]\n\nThus, the number of cups each girl brought is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

        "To determine how many cups each girl brought, we start by identifying the number of boys and girls in Ms. Leech's class. According to the problem, there are 30 students in total and twice as many girls as boys. Let's denote the number of boys as \\( B \\) and the number of girls as \\( G \\). We know:\n\n\\[ B = 10 \\]\n\\[ G = 2B = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we know that each boy brought 5 cups for the science activity. Therefore, the total number of cups brought by the boys is:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times B = 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\]\n\nLet's denote the number of cups each girl brought as \\( x \\). Since there are 20 girls, the total number of cups brought by the girls is:\n\n\\[ 20x \\]\n\nThe total number of cups brought by all the students is given as 90. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 50 + 20x = 90 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first isolate the term with \\( x \\) by subtracting 50 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 20x = 90 - 50 \\]\n\\[ 20x = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 20:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{40}{20} \\]\n\\[ x = 2 \\]\n\nThus, each girl brought \\(\\boxed{2}\\) cups.",

According to the problem, there are 30 students in total and twice as many girls as boys. Let \\( b \\) represent the number of boys. Then the number of girls, \\( g \\), can be expressed as \\( g = 2b \\).\n\nWe know from the problem that there are 10 boys in the class, so:\n\\[ b = 10 \\]\nSubstituting this value into the equation for the number of girls, we get:\n\\[ g = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of cups brought by the boys. Each boy brought 5 cups, and there are 10 boys, so the total number of cups brought by the boys is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\]\n\nThe problem states that the total number of cups brought by all the students is 90. Therefore, the total number of cups brought by the girls is:\n\\[ 90 - 50 = 40 \\]\n\nSince there are 20 girls, we can find the number of cups each girl brought by dividing the total number of cups brought by the girls by the number of girls:\n\\[ \\frac{40}{20} = 2 \\]\n\nThus, each girl brought \\(\\boxed{2}\\) cups."
