According to the problem, this age difference will also be 30 years less than Finley's age in 15 years. So, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 25 = (F + 15) - 30 \\]\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 25 = F + 15 - 30 = F - 15 \\]\nTo find Finley's current age, we add 15 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ F = 25 + 15 = 40 \\]\nSo, Finley is currently 40 years old.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",

        "To determine Finley's current age, we need to follow a series of logical steps based on the information given.\n\n1. **Determine Roger's current age:**\n   - Jill's current age is 20 years.\n   - Roger's age is 5 more than twice Jill's age.\n   - Therefore, Roger's age is \\(2 \\times 20 + 5 = 40 + 5 = 45\\) years.\n\n2. **Determine the age difference between Roger and Jill:**\n   - Roger is 45 years old and Jill is 20 years old.\n   - The age difference is \\(45 - 20 = 25\\) years.\n\n3. **Determine their ages in 15 years:**\n   - In 15 years, Roger will be \\(45 + 15 = 60\\) years old.\n   - In 15 years, Jill will be \\(20 + 15 = 35\\) years old.\n   - The age difference in 15 years will still be 25 years (since the difference between their ages remains constant).\n\n4. **Determine Finley's age in 15 years:**\n   - According to the problem, in 15 years, their age difference will be 30 years less than Finley's age.\n   - Therefore, Finley's age in 15 years will be \\(25 + 30 = 55\\) years.\n\n5. **Determine Finley's current age:**\n   - If Finley will be 55 years old in 15 years, then Finley's current age is \\(55 - 15 = 40\\) years.\n\nThus, Finley's current age is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
        "To determine Finley's current age, we start by finding Roger's current age. We know from the problem that Roger's age is 5 more than twice Jill's age. Given that Jill is currently 20 years old, we can calculate Roger's age as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Roger's age} = 2 \\times \\text{Jill's age} + 5 = 2 \\times 20 + 5 = 40 + 5 = 45\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the age difference between Roger and Jill in 15 years. Since Roger is currently 45 years old and Jill is currently 20 years old, their age difference is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Age difference} = 45 - 20 = 25\n\\]\n\nIn 15 years, this age difference will remain the same because both Roger and Jill will age by the same amount. Therefore, in 15 years, their age difference will still be 25 years. According to the problem, in 15 years, their age difference will be 30 years less than Finley's age. Let \\( F \\) represent Finley's current age. In 15 years, Finley's age will be \\( F + 15 \\). We can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n25 = (F + 15) - 30\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n25 = F + 15 - 30 = F - 15\n\\]\n\nTo find Finley's current age, we solve for \\( F \\) by adding 15 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\nF = 25 + 15 = 40\n\\]\n\nThus, Finley's current age is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
