        "To determine how many hours Steve spends with his family in a day, we first need to calculate the total fraction of the day he spends sleeping, in school, and making assignments. The fractions given are \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\), and \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\).\n\nFirst, we find a common denominator for these fractions. The least common multiple of 3, 6, and 12 is 12. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1 \\times 4}{3 \\times 4} = \\frac{4}{12}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1 \\times 2}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{2}{12}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add these fractions together:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{2}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{4 + 2 + 1}{12} = \\frac{7}{12}\n\\]\n\nThis means that Steve spends \\(\\frac{7}{12}\\) of the day sleeping, in school, and making assignments. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we need to find out how many hours this fraction represents:\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{12} \\times 24 = \\frac{7 \\times 24}{12} = \\frac{168}{12} = 14\n\\]\n\nSo, Steve spends 14 hours sleeping, in school, and making assignments. Therefore, the number of hours he spends with his family is:\n\\[\n24 - 14 = 10\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

We start by finding a common denominator for the fractions \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\), and \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\). The least common denominator for these fractions is 12.\n\nNext, we convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 12:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1 \\times 4}{3 \\times 4} = \\frac{4}{12}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1 \\times 2}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{2}{12}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add these fractions together:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{2}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{4 + 2 + 1}{12} = \\frac{7}{12}\n\\]\n\nThis means that Steve spends \\(\\frac{7}{12}\\) of the day sleeping, in school, and making assignments. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can find out how many hours this fraction represents by multiplying \\(\\frac{7}{12}\\) by 24:\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{12} \\times 24 = \\frac{7 \\times 24}{12} = \\frac{168}{12} = 14\n\\]\n\nSo, Steve spends 14 hours sleeping, in school, and making assignments. To find out how many hours he spends with his family, we subtract this time from the total number of hours in a day:\n\\[\n24 - 14 = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Steve spends \\(\\boxed{10}\\) hours with his family in a day.",
