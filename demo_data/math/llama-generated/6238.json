The tickets were expensive so Clyde made a deal with his kids.  If the average of their scores on their next math test was higher than 89, then he would buy them tickets to the concert.   June earned a 97 on her math test, Patty earned an 85, Josh earned a 100 on his test and Henry earned a 94.  What was their average math test score?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
