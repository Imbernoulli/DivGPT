        "To determine how much money is in Steve's bank account after two years, we need to account for the initial deposit, the interest earned, and the additional deposits made each year.

        "To determine how much money Steve has in his bank account after two years, we need to account for both the interest earned and the additional deposits made each year. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Year 0: Initial Deposit**\n- Steve starts with $100.\n\n**Year 1:**\n- At the end of the first year, the $100 from Year 0 earns 10% interest.\n- Interest earned in Year 1: \\(100 \\times 0.10 = 10\\).\n- Steve also deposits $10 at the end of the year.\n- Total amount at the end of Year 1: \\(100 + 10 + 10 = 120\\).\n\n**Year 2:**\n- At the end of the second year, the $120 from Year 1 earns 10% interest.\n- Interest earned in Year 2: \\(120 \\times 0.10 = 12\\).\n- Steve also deposits $10 at the end of the year.\n- Total amount at the end of Year 2: \\(120 + 12 + 10 = 142\\).\n\nThus, the amount of money in Steve's bank account after two years is \\(\\boxed{142}\\).",
