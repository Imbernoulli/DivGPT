        "To determine how many times Matthew will fill his 35-ounce water bottle each week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of water Matthew drinks per day.\n2. Calculate the total amount of water Matthew drinks per week.\n3. Determine how many times Matthew needs to fill his water bottle to meet his weekly water intake.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water Matthew drinks per day.**\n\nMatthew drinks 4 glasses of water per day, and each glass is 5 ounces. Therefore, the total amount of water he drinks per day is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ glasses/day} \\times 5 \\text{ ounces/glass} = 20 \\text{ ounces/day} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water Matthew drinks per week.**\n\nThere are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of water he drinks per week is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ ounces/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 140 \\text{ ounces/week} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many times Matthew needs to fill his water bottle to meet his weekly water intake.**\n\nEach water bottle holds 35 ounces. To find out how many times Matthew needs to fill his water bottle each week, we divide the total amount of water he drinks per week by the capacity of the water bottle:\n\\[ \\frac{140 \\text{ ounces/week}}{35 \\text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \\text{ times/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, Matthew will fill his water bottle \\(\\boxed{4}\\) times each week.",
