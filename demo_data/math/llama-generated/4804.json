        "To determine how many rubber bands Aira had, we start by defining the number of rubber bands each person originally had in terms of a variable. Let's say Joe had \\( J \\) rubber bands.

Samantha had 5 more bands than Aira, so Samantha had \\( (J - 1) + 5 = J + 4 \\) rubber bands.\n\nThe total number of rubber bands that Samantha, Aira, and Joe had together is the sum of their individual amounts:\n\\[ (J + 4) + (J - 1) + J = 3J + 3. \\]\n\nWe know that after dividing the bands equally, each of them received 6 rubber bands. Therefore, the total number of rubber bands is also equal to \\( 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\). We can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 3J + 3 = 18. \\]\n\nTo find \\( J \\), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3J = 15. \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ J = 5. \\]\n\nSo, Joe had 5 rubber bands.

        "To determine how many rubber bands Aira had, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve them step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( J \\) represent the number of rubber bands Joe had.\n   - Since Aira had 1 fewer band than Joe, Aira had \\( J - 1 \\) bands.\n   - Since Samantha had 5 more bands than Aira, Samantha had \\( (J - 1) + 5 = J + 4 \\) bands.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - They divided their bands equally, and each received 6 rubber bands.

        "To determine how many rubber bands Aira had, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the number of rubber bands each person originally had:\n\n- Let \\( A \\) be the number of rubber bands Aira had.\n- Let \\( S \\) be the number of rubber bands Samantha had.\n- Let \\( J \\) be the number of rubber bands Joe had.\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following:\n1.

After dividing the bands equally, each person received 6 bands.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of rubber bands they had before dividing them equally:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of bands} = S + A + J\n\\]\n\nSince each person received 6 bands after division:\n\\[\n3 \\times 6 = 18\n\\]\n\\[\nS + A + J = 18\n\\]\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for \\( S \\) and \\( A \\) from the given relationships into the total切成 cam-encoded equation:\n\\[\n(A + 5) + A + (A + 1) = 18\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left-hand side:\n\\[\n3A + 6 = 18\n\\]\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\\[\n3A = 12\n\\]\n\nDivide by 3:\n\\[\nA = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, Aira had \\(\\boxed{4}\\) rubber bands.
