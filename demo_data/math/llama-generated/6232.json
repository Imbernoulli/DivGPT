The gap between Connie's grandmother and her sister is twice the gap between her older brother and her older sister.\n\nFirst, calculate the gap between the older brother and the older sister:\n\\[\n1936 - 1932 = 4\n\\]\nSo, the gap between Connie's grandmother and her sister is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nSince Connie's grandmother is older than her sister, we can express this gap as:\n\\[\nG - 1936 = 8\n\\]\nTo find \\( G \\), solve the equation:\n\\[\nG = 1936 + 8 = 1944\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Connie's grandmother was born in the year \\(\\boxed{1944}\\).",

        "To determine the year Connie's grandmother was born, let's denote the year of her birth as \\( x \\). We know the following information:\n\n1. Connie's grandmother's older brother was born in 1932.\n2. Connie's grandmother's older sister was born in 1936.\n3. The gap between Connie's grandmother and her sister is twice the gap between the older brother and the older sister.\n\nFirst, we calculate the gap between the older brother and the older sister:\n\\[ 1936 - 1932 = 4 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the gap between Connie's grandmother and her sister is twice this gap:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nSince Connie's grandmother is 8 years older than her sister, we can express this relationship as:\n\\[ x = 1936 + 8 \\]\n\nNow, we perform the addition:\n\\[ x = 1944 \\]\n\nTherefore, Connie's grandmother was born in the year \\(\\boxed{1944}\\).",
