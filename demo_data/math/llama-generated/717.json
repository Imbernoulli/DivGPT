He sees that she has a 20-ounce thermos and when she makes her coffee she pours a 1/2 cup of milk in, and then fills the coffee to the top. She does this twice a day. After the five-day school week, he decides to tell her, and when she hears how much coffee she drinks, she decides to drink 1/4 of what she normally drinks.

        "To determine how many ounces of coffee Colston's teacher drinks each week after deciding to drink only 1/4 of what she normally drinks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of coffee she drinks per day:**\n   - The thermos has a capacity of 20 ounces.\n   - She pours 1/2 cup of milk into the thermos. Since 1 cup is equal to 8 ounces, 1/2 cup is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = 4 \\text{ ounces}\n     \\]\n   - The remaining volume in the thermos is filled with coffee. Therefore, the volume of coffee per thermos is:\n     \\[\n     20 - 4 = 16 \\text{ ounces}\n     \\]\n   - She fills the thermos twice a day, so the total volume of coffee she drinks per day is:\n     \\[\n     16 \\times 2 = 32 \\text{ ounces}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of coffee she drinks in a five-day school week:**\n   - She drinks 32 ounces of coffee per day for 5 days, so the total volume of coffee she drinks in a week is:\n     \\[\n     32 \\times 5 = 160 \\text{ ounces}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the new volume of coffee she drinks after deciding to drink 1/4 of what she normally drinks:**\n   - She decides to drink 1/4 of 160 ounces, so the new volume of coffee she drinks per week is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4} \\times 160 = 40 \\text{ ounces}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ounces of coffee she now drinks a week is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
