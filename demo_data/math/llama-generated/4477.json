        "To determine John's profit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of puppies John gives away:**\n   John starts with 8 puppies and gives away half of them.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n   \\]\n   So, John gives away 4 puppies.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of puppies John keeps:**\n   After giving away 4 puppies, John has:\n   \\[\n   8 - 4 = 4\n   \\]\n   puppies left.\n\n3. **Determine how many puppies John sells:**\n   John keeps one of the remaining puppies, so he sells:\n   \\[\n   4 - 1 = 3\n   \\]\n   puppies.\n\n4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the puppies:**\n   Each puppy is sold for $600, so the total revenue is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 600 = 1800\n   \\]\n   dollars.\n\n5. **Calculate John's profit:**\n   John had to give the owner of the stud $300.
