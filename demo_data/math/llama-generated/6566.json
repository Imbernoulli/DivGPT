Since Hurley is currently 14 years old, we can find Richard's current age by adding 20 years to Hurley's age:\n\\[ \\text{Richard's current age} = 14 + 20 = 34 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate Richard's age 40 years from now:\n\\[ \\text{Richard's age in 40 years} = 34 + 40 = 74 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate Hurley's age 40 years from now:\n\\[ \\text{Hurley's age in 40 years} = 14 + 40 = 54 \\]\n\nFinally, we add Richard's and Hurley's ages 40 years from now to find their combined ages:\n\\[ \\text{Combined ages in 40 years} = 74 + 54 = 128 \\]\n\nThus, the combined ages of Richard and Hurley 40 years from now is \\(\\boxed{128}\\).",
