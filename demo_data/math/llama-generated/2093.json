So, the total number of stockings is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ (grandchildren)} + 4 \\text{ (children)} = 9 \\text{ children} \\]\n\\[ 5 \\text{ stockings/child} \\times 9 \\text{ children} = 45 \\text{ stockings} \\]\n\nNext, let's move to step 2:\n\nThe cost of each stocking is $20.00, so the total cost of the stockings before the discount is:\n\\[ 45 \\text{ stockings} \\times 20 \\text{ dollars/stocking} = 900 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's apply the 10% discount to the cost of the stockings. The discount amount is:\n\\[ 900 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.10 = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nSo, the discounted cost of the stockings is:\n\\[ 900 \\text{ dollars} - 90 \\text{ dollars} = 810 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's move to step 4:\n\nThe cost of monogramming is $5.00 per stocking, so the total cost of the monogramming is:\n\\[ 45 \\text{ stockings} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/stocking} = 225 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, let's move to step 5:\n\nThe total cost of the stockings is the sum of the discounted cost of the stockings and the cost of the monogramming:\n\\[ 810 \\text{ dollars} + 225 \\text{ dollars} = 1035 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the stockings is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1035} \\]",

Add the cost of monogramming to the total cost of the stockings.\n\nLet's start with step 1. Pearl wants to order 5 stockings for each of her 5 grandchildren and her own 4 children. So, the total number of stockings is:\n\\[ 5 \\times (5 + 4) = 5 \\times 9 = 45 \\]\n\nNext, let's move to step 2. The original price of each stocking is $20.00, and there is a 10% discount. The discount amount per stocking is:\n\\[ 20.00 \\times 0.10 = 2.00 \\]\nSo, the price of each stocking after the discount is:\n\\[ 20.00 - 2.00 = 18.00 \\]\n\nNow, let's proceed to step 3. The total cost of the stockings before monogramming is:\n\\[ 45 \\times 18.00 = 810.00 \\]\n\nFinally, let's move to step 4. The cost of monogramming is $5.00 per stocking, so the total cost of monogramming is:\n\\[ 45 \\times 5.00 = 225.00 \\]\nAdding the cost of monogramming to the total cost of the stockings gives:\n\\[ 810.00 + 225.00 = 1035.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the stockings is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1035.00} \\]"
