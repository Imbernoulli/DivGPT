        "To determine how many bonnets Mrs. Young sent to each orphanage, we need to calculate the total number of bonnets she made throughout the week and then divide that total by 5.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of bonnets made each day:\n- On Monday, Mrs. Young made 10 bonnets.\n- On Tuesday and Wednesday combined, she made twice as many bonnets as she did on Monday. Therefore, she made \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) bonnets on Tuesday and Wednesday combined.\n- On Thursday, she made 5 more bonnets than she did on Monday. Therefore, she made \\(10 + 5 = 15\\) bonnets on Thursday.\n- On Friday, she made 5 less bonnets than she did on Thursday. Therefore, she made \\(15 - 5 = 10\\) bonnets on Friday.\n\nNext, we sum the bonnets made each day to find the total number of bonnets made in the week:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ (Monday)} + 20 \\text{ (Tuesday and Wednesday combined)} + 15 \\text{ (Thursday)} + 10 \\text{ (Friday)} = 55\n\\]\n\nNow, we divide the total number of bonnets by 5 to find out how many bonnets each orphanage received:\n\\[\n\\frac{55}{5} = 11\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Young sent \\(\\boxed{11}\\) bonnets to each orphanage.",
