So, we can calculate Michiko's points as follows:\n\\[ M = \\frac{B}{2} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\]\n\nAkiko scored 4 more points than Michiko. So, we can calculate Akiko's points as follows:\n\\[ A = M + 4 = 7 + 4 = 11 \\]\n\nChandra scored twice as many points as Akiko. So, we can calculate Chandra's points as follows:\n\\[ C = 2A = 2 \\times 11 = 22 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total points scored by the team by adding the points scored by each player:\n\\[ \\text{Total points} = B + M + A + C = 14 + 7 + 11 + 22 = 54 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total points scored by the team in the final game of the season is:\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]",
