Find the difference between the total amount of fees collected when the stadium is 3/4 full and when it is completely full.\n\nLet's start with step 1:\n\nThe capacity of the stadium is 2000 people. When the stadium is 3/4 full, the number of people in the stadium is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 2000 = 1500\n\\]\n\nNext, step 2:\n\nEach person paid $20 in entry fees. Therefore, the total amount of fees collected when the stadium is 3/4 full is:\n\\[\n1500 \\times 20 = 30000\n\\]\n\nNow, step 3:\n\nWhen the stadium is completely full, the number of people in the stadium is:\n\\[\n2000\n\\]\n\nThen, step 4:\n\nThe total amount of fees collected when the stadium is completely full is:\n\\[\n2000 \\times 20 = 40000\n\\]\n\nFinally, step 5:\n\nThe difference between the total amount of fees collected when the stadium is 3/4 full and when it is completely full is:\n\\[\n40000 - 30000 = 10000\n\\]\n\nThus, the difference is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10000}\n\\]"
