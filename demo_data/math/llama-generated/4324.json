Determine the amount covered by James's insurance.\n3. Subtract the amount covered by insurance from the total cost to find the out-of-pocket cost.\n\nLet's start with the total cost of the doctor visit, which is $300.\n\nNext, we calculate the amount covered by James's insurance. Since his insurance covers 80%, we multiply the total cost by 80% (or 0.80):\n\\[\n300 \\times 0.80 = 240\n\\]\nSo, James's insurance covers $240 of the $300 cost.\n\nTo find out how much James has to pay out-of-pocket, we subtract the amount covered by insurance from the total cost:\n\\[\n300 - 240 = 60\n\\]\nTherefore, James's out-of-pocket cost is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
