        "To determine the total number of baseball cards that Jorge, Matias, and Carlos have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many baseball cards Carlos has.\n2. Determine how many baseball cards Matias has.\n3. Determine how many baseball cards Jorge has.\n4. Sum the number of baseball cards each person has.\n\nFirst, we know that Carlos has 20 baseball cards. According to the problem, Matias has 6 fewer cards than Carlos. Therefore, we can calculate the number of baseball cards Matias has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cards Matias has} = \\text{Number of cards Carlos has} - 6 = 20 - 6 = 14\n\\]\n\nNext, the problem states that Jorge has an equal number of baseball cards as Matias. Therefore, Jorge also has 14 baseball cards. Now, we can find the total number of baseball cards by adding the number of cards each person has:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of cards} = \\text{Number of cards Carlos has} + \\text{Number of cards Matias has} + \\text{Number of cards Jorge has} = 20 + 14 + 14 = 48\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of baseball cards the three have is \\(\\boxed{48}\\).",

Add up the number of baseball cards each person has.\n\nLet's start with the information given:\n- Carlos has 20 baseball cards.\n- Matias has 6 fewer cards than Carlos.\n- Jorge has an equal number of baseball cards as Matias.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of baseball cards Matias has:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cards Matias has} = \\text{Number of cards Carlos has} - 6 = 20 - 6 = 14\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of baseball cards Jorge has:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cards Jorge has} = \\text{Number of cards Matias has} = 14\n\\]\n\nNow, we add up the number of baseball cards each person has:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of cards} = \\text{Number of cards Carlos has} + \\text{Number of cards Matias has} + \\text{Number of cards Jorge has} = 20 + 14 + 14 = 48\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of baseball cards the three have is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{48}\n\\]",
