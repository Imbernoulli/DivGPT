        "Let's define the cost of the pencil as \\( x \\) dollars. According to the problem, the pen costs twice as much as the pencil, so the cost of the pen is \\( 2x \\) dollars. The total cost of the pen and the pencil is given as $6. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\n\\[\nx + 2x = 6\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation gives:\n\n\\[\n3x = 6\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{6}{3} = 2\n\\]\n\nSo, the cost of the pencil is $2. Since the pen costs twice as much as the pencil, the cost of the pen is:\n\n\\[\n2x = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the pen is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

Since the pen costs twice as much as the pencil, the cost of the pen is:\n\\[\n2x = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n\\]\nTherefore, the cost of the pen is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
