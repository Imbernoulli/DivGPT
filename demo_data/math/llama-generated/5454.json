        "To determine the total number of legs of all Mark's animals, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of goats Mark has.\n2. Determine the total number of legs for the kangaroos.\n3. Determine the total number of legs for the goats.\n4. Add the total number of legs for the kangaroos and the goats.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of goats Mark has.**\n\nMark has three times as many goats as kangaroos. Since he has 23 kangaroos, we can calculate the number of goats as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\times 23 = 69\n\\]\nSo, Mark has 69 goats.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of legs for the kangaroos.**\n\nEach kangaroo has 2 legs. Since Mark has 23 kangaroos, the total number of legs for the kangaroos is:\n\\[\n23 \\times 2 = 46\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total number of legs for the goats.**\n\nEach goat has 4 legs. Since Mark has 69 goats, the total number of legs for the goats is:\n\\[\n69 \\times 4 = 276\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Add the total number of legs for the kangaroos and the goats.**\n\nTo find the total number of legs of all the animals, we add the total number of legs for the kangaroos and the total number of legs for the goats:\n\\[\n46 + 276 = 322\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs of all Mark's animals is \\boxed{322}.",

Since each goat has 4 legs, and Mark has 69 goats, we multiply 69 by 4:\n\\[\n69 \\times 4 = 276\n\\]\nSo, the total number of legs for the goats is 276.\n\nFinally, we add the total number of legs from the kangaroos and the goats to get the final answer:\n\\[\n46 + 276 = 322\n\\]\nSo, the total number of legs of all his animals is \\boxed{322}.",
