Determine the cost per square inch for each TV.\n3. Find the difference in cost per square inch between the two TVs.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the area of each TV.**\n\nFor the first TV:\n- Width: 24 inches\n- Height: 16 inches\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{Width} \\times \\text{Height} = 24 \\times 16 = 384 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nFor the new TV:\n- Width: 48 inches\n- Height: 32 inches\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{Width} \\times \\text{Height} = 48 \\times 32 = 1536 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost per square inch for each TV.**\n\nFor the first TV:\n- Cost: $672\n- Area: 384 square inches\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per square inch} = \\frac{\\text{Cost}}{\\text{Area}} = \\frac{672}{384} = 1.75 \\text{ dollars per square inch}\n\\]\n\nFor the new TV:\n- Cost: $1152\n- Area: 1536 square inches\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per square inch} = \\frac{\\text{Cost}}{\\text{Area}} = \\frac{1152}{1536} = 0.75 \\text{ dollars per square inch}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference in cost per square inch between the two TVs.**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Cost per square inch of first TV} - \\text{Cost per square inch of new TV} = 1.75 - 0.75 = 1 \\text{ dollar per square inch}\n\\]\n\nThus, Mark's first TV was \\(\\boxed{1}\\) dollar more expensive per square inch compared to his new TV."
