        "Let's denote the total number of cans of silly string Michelle had initially as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, Michelle split the cans among Roger and his 3 friends.

According to the problem, after giving away 2 cans, Roger has 4 cans left. So, we can write the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{4} - 2 = 4 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve this equation step by step. First, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{4} = 6 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply both sides by 4 to isolate \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, Michelle had \\(\\boxed{24}\\) cans of silly string to start with.",

        "Let's start by determining how many cans Roger received from Michelle. According to the problem, Roger gave 2 of his cans to his brothers and now has 4 for himself. This means that before giving the cans to his brothers, Roger had \\(4 + 2 = 6\\) cans.\n\nSince Roger and his 3 friends received the cans from Michelle, the total number of people who received cans is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). If each person received 6 cans, then the total number of cans Michelle had to start with is \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n\nThus, the number of cans of silly string Michelle had to start with is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
