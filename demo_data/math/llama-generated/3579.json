        "To determine how long it will take Tom to type out 10 pages, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of words in 10 pages:**\n   Each page has 450 words. Therefore, for 10 pages:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ pages} \\times 450 \\text{ words per page} = 4500 \\text{ words}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Tom's typing rate:**\n   Tom types 90 words per minute.\n\n3. **Calculate the time required to type 4500 words:**\n   To find the time, we divide the total number of words by Tom's typing rate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4500 \\text{ words}}{90 \\text{ words per minute}} = 50 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, it will take Tom \\boxed{50} minutes to type out 10 pages.",

We know that Tom types at a rate of 90 words per minute. Therefore, we divide the total number of words by his typing speed:\n\\[\n4500 \\text{ words} \\div 90 \\text{ words per minute} = 50 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nSo, it will take Tom \\boxed{50} minutes to type out 10 pages.",
