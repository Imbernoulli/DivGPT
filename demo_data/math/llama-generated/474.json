Determine how much Mike saves each year.\n3. Calculate the number of years it will take Mike to save the required amount.\n\nFirst, we calculate the downpayment amount. The cost of the house is $450,000, and Mike needs to save 20% of this cost. Therefore, the downpayment is:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 450,000 = 90,000\n\\]\nSo, Mike needs to save $90,000.\n\nNext, we determine how much Mike saves each year. Mike saves 10% of his $150,000 annual salary. Therefore, his annual savings is:\n\\[\n0.10 \\times 150,000 = 15,000\n\\]\nSo, Mike saves $15,000 each year.\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of years it will take Mike to save $90,000. We do this by dividing the total amount needed by the annual savings:\n\\[\n\\frac{90,000}{15,000} = 6\n\\]\nSo, it will take Mike 6 years to save up for the downpayment.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
