She earns $5 per week and has been saving for 10 weeks, but she spent some on ice cream and now has only $20. If she had saved all her allowance for 10 weeks, she would have:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ weeks} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/week} = 50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nSince she has $20 now, she must have spent:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ dollars} - 20 \\text{ dollars} = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nSo, she has $20 left to save for the wristwatch. The wristwatch costs $100, so she still needs:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ dollars} - 20 \\text{ dollars} = 80 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nSince she earns $5 per week, the number of additional weeks she needs to save $80 is:\n\\[ \\frac{80 \\text{ dollars}}{5 \\text{ dollars/week}} = 16 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nTherefore, Barbara needs to save for \\boxed{16} more weeks.",
