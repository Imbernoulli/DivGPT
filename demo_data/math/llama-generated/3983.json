        "To determine the total number of treasures Simon found on the beach, we need to calculate the number of each type of treasure step by step.\n\n1. **Sand dollars**: Simon collected 10 sand dollars.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sand dollars} = 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sea glass**: The jar holds three times as many pieces of glass as the bag does sand dollars. Since the bag contains 10 sand dollars, the jar contains:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ Sea glass} = 3 \\times 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. **Seashells**: The bucket holds five times as many seashells as the jar holds pieces of glass.

        "To determine the total number of treasures Simon found on the beach, we need to calculate the number of each type of treasure and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that Simon collected a bag of ten sand dollars.
