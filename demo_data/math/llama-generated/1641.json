        "To determine how many passing yards per game Tom Brady needs to average to beat the passing yards record, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total passing yards needed to beat the record.\n2. Subtract Tom Brady's current passing yards from the total passing yards needed.\n3. Divide the result by the number of games left in the season.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total passing yards needed to beat the record. The current record is 5999 yards, and Tom Brady already has 4200 yards. Therefore, the total passing yards needed is:\n\\[ 5999 + 1 = 6000 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract Tom Brady's current passing yards from the total passing yards needed:\n\\[ 6000 - 4200 = 1800 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nFinally, we divide the result by the number of games left in the season. Tom Brady has 6 games left, so the average passing yards per game needed is:\n\\[ \\frac{1800}{6} = 300 \\text{ yards per game} \\]\n\nThus, Tom Brady needs to average \\(\\boxed{300}\\) passing yards per game to beat the record.",

We do this by dividing the total additional yards needed by the number of games left:\n\\[ \\frac{1799}{6} = 299.8333 \\]\n\nSince Brady cannot necessarily achieve a fraction of a yard in an actual game, we round up to the next whole number to ensure he beats the record.

Calculate the total number of passing yards Tom Brady needs to beat the record.\n2. Subtract his current passing yards from the total number of passing yards needed.\n3. Divide the result by the number of games left in the season.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of passing yards Tom Brady needs to beat the record. The current record is 5999 yards, and Tom Brady currently has 4200 yards. Therefore, the total number of passing yards he needs is:\n\\[ 5999 + 1 = 6000 \\text{ yards} \\]\nSince he currently has 4200 yards, the additional yards he needs to reach 6000 yards is:\n\\[ 6000 - 4200 = 1800 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many passing yards per game he needs to average over the remaining 6 games.

        "To determine how many passing yards per game Tom Brady needs to average to beat the record, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of passing yards required to beat the current record.\n2. Subtract Tom Brady's current passing yards from the total required yards to find out how many more yards he needs.\n3. Divide the remaining yards needed by the number of games left to find the average yards per game required.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The current passing yards record is 5999 yards. Tom Brady currently has 4200 yards. To beat the record, he needs more than 5999 yards. Therefore, the total number of passing yards required to beat the record is:\n   \\[\n   5999 + 1 = 6000 \\text{ yards}\n   \\]\n   (We add 1 because he needs more than the current record.)\n\n2. Subtract Tom Brady's current passing yards from the total required yards to find out how many more yards he needs:\n   \\[\n   6000 - 4200 = 1800 \\text{ yards}\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide the remaining yards needed by the number of games left to find the average yards per game required.

Calculate the average passing yards per game required.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of passing yards Tom Brady needs to rooms the current record.**\n\nThe current record is 5999 yards, and Tom Brady currently has 4200 yards. Therefore, the number of yards he needs to rent is:\n\\[ 5999 + 1 - 4200 = 1800 \\text{ yards} \\]\n(We add 1 to the record because he needs to beat the record, not just tie it.)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of games ob remaining.**\n\nTom Brady has 6 games left in the season.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the average passing yards per game required.**\n\nTo find the average passing yards per game, we divide the total number of yards needed by the number of games remaining:\n\\[ \\frac{1800 \\text{ yards}}{6 \\text{ games}} = 300 \\text{ yards per game} \\]\n\nTherefore, Tom Brady needs to average \\(\\boxed{300}\\) passing yards per game to beat the record.",

Divide the remaining yards by the number of games left to find the average yards per game required.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The current passing yards record is 5999 yards. Tom Brady currently has 4200 yards. Therefore, the total number of passing yards needed to beat the record is:\n\\[ 5999 + 1 = 6000 \\text{ yards} \\]\n(Since he needs more than 5999 yards to beat the record, we add 1 yard.)\n\nNext, we subtract the number of passing yards he currently has from the total needed:\n\\[ 6000 - 4200 = 1800 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nNow, we divide the remaining yards by the number of games left to find the average yards per game required:\n\\[ \\frac{1800}{6} = 300 \\text{ yards per game} \\]\n\nTherefore, Tom Brady needs to average \\(\\boxed{300}\\) passing yards per game to beat the record.",

Determine the number of games left in the season.\n4. Calculate the average passing yards per game Tom Brady needs to achieve.\n\nFirst, the current passing yards record is 5999 yards, and Tom Brady currently has 4200 yards. To find out how many more yards Tom Brady needs to beat the record, we subtract his current passing yards from the record and add 1 yard (to beat the record):\n\n\\[ 5999 - 4200 + 1 = 1799 + 1 = 1800 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nTom Brady needs 1800 additional yards to beat the record.

Determine the number of games left in the season.\n4. Calculate the average number of passing yards per game Tom Brady needs to achieve.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The current passing yards record is 5999 yards, and Tom Brady currently has 4200 yards. To beat the record, Tom Brady needs more than 5999 yards. Therefore, we calculate the total number of passing yards he needs to exceed the record:\n\n\\[ 5999 - 4200 = 1799 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Tom Brady has 6 games left in the season. To find out how many passing yards per game he needs to average to beat the record, we divide the total number of passing yards he needs by the number of games left:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1799}{6} = 299.8333 \\]\n\nSince Tom Brady cannot average a fraction of a yard per game in practical terms, we round up to the next whole number.

        "To determine how many passing yards per game Tom Brady needs to average to beat the passing yards record in a season, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the current passing yards record and Tom Brady's current passing yards:**\n   - Current passing yards record: 5999 yards\n   - Tom Brady's current passing yards: 4200 yards\n\n2. **Calculate the additional passing yards needed to beat the record:**\n   - Additional yards needed = Current passing yards record + 1 yard (to beat the record) - Tom Brady's current passing yards\n   \\[\n   5999 + 1 - 4200 = 1800 \\text{ yards}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of games left in the season:**\n   - Games left: 6\n\n4. **Calculate the average passing yards per game needed:**\n   - Average yards per game = Additional yards needed / Games left\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1800}{6} = 300 \\text{ yards per game}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Tom Brady needs to average \\boxed{300} passing yards per game to beat the record.",
        "To determine how many passing yards per game Tom Brady needs to average to beat the record, we first need to calculate the total number of yards he requires to break the record. The current record is 5999 yards, and Brady currently has 4200 yards. Therefore, the number of yards he needs to Circular醒目 is:\n\n\\[ 5999 - 4200 = 1799 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many games he has left in the season, which is 6 games. To find the average number of passing yards per game he needs to achieve, we divide the total number of yards he needs by the number of games he has left:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1799}{6} \\approx 299.83 \\]\n\nSince the number of passing yards per game must be a whole number (you can't average a fraction of a yard in basketball), we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, Brady needs to average at least 300 passing yards per game to beat the record.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{300}\n\\]",
