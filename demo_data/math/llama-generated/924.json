Harly adopts out 40% of her 80 dogs. So, we calculate:\n\\[ 40\\% \\text{ of } 80 = \\frac{40}{100} \\times 80 = 0.4 \\times 80 = 32 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of dogs adopted out from the initial number of dogs:\n\\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \\]\n\nThen, we add the number of dogs taken back to the result from step 2:\n\\[ 48 + 5 = 53 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of dogs Harly has now is:\n\\[ \\boxed{53} \\]",

Add the number of dogs taken back to the result from the previous step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of dogs adopted out. Harly adopts out 40% of the 80 dogs. We can find 40% of 80 by multiplying 80 by 0.40:\n\\[ 80 \\times 0.40 = 32 \\]\nSo, 32 dogs are adopted out.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of dogs adopted out from the original number of dogs:\n\\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \\]\nSo, after the adoptions, there are 48 dogs left.\n\nThen, we add the number of dogs taken back to the result from the previous step. Harly has to take back 5 dogs:\n\\[ 48 + 5 = 53 \\]\nSo, after taking back the dogs, there are 53 dogs left.\n\nTherefore, the number of dogs Harly has now is \\(\\boxed{53}\\).",
