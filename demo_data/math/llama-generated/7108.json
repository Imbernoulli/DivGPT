        "Let's define the number of apples Kylie picked as \\( x \\). According to the problem, Kayla picked 10 more than 4 times the amount of apples that Kylie picked. So, we can express the number of apples Kayla picked as \\( 4x + 10 \\).\n\nThe total number of apples picked by Kylie and Kayla together is 340. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ x + (4x + 10) = 340 \\]\n\nFirst, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 5x + 10 = 340 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate the term with \\( x \\) by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 5x = 330 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 5:\n\\[ x = 66 \\]\n\nSo, Kylie picked 66 apples. To find out how many apples Kayla picked, we substitute \\( x = 66 \\) back into the expression for the number of apples Kayla picked:\n\\[ 4x + 10 = 4(66) + 10 = 264 + 10 = 274 \\]\n\nTherefore, Kayla picked \\(\\boxed{274}\\) apples.",
