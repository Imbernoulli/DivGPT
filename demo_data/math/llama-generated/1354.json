        "To determine how many yellow balloons Anya took home, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **假设每个颜色的 balloons数量相等：**\n   由于总共有672个 balloons，且它们被分为绿色、蓝色、黄色和红色四种颜色，我们可以通过将总数量除以4来找到每种颜色的 balloons数量。\n   \\[\n   \\text{每种颜色的 balloons数量} = \\frac{672}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. **计算每种颜色的 balloons数量：**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{672}{4} = 168\n   \\]\n   因此，有168个绿色 balloons，168个蓝色 balloons，168个黄色 balloons，和168个红色 balloons。\n\n3. **确定 Anya 取了多少 yellow balloons：**\n   Anya 取了 half of the yellow balloons.为了找到这个数量，我们将黄色 balloons 的数量除以2。\n   \\[\n   \\text{Anya 取的 yellow balloons数量} = \\frac{168}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **计算 Anya 取的 yellow balloons数量：**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{168}{2} = 84\n   \\]\n\n因此，Anya 取 home \\(\\boxed{84}\\) 个 yellow balloons."
