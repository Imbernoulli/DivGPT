Multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks (4 weeks).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of papayas each family member eats in one week:\n- Jake eats 3 papayas.\n- Jake's brother eats 5 papayas.\n- Jake's father eats 4 papayas.\n\nNext, we sum the total number of papayas consumed by the family in one week:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ (Jake)} + 5 \\text{ (brother)} + 4 \\text{ (father)} = 12 \\text{ papayas per week}\n\\]\n\nNow, we multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks (4 weeks):\n\\[\n12 \\text{ papayas per week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 48 \\text{ papayas}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jake needs to buy \\boxed{48} papayas from the farmer's market.",
