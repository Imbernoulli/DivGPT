His teammates' average points per game is 40, so over 5 games, they will score:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ points/game} \\times 5 \\text{ games} = 200 \\text{ points} \\]\n\nNow, we add Wade's total points and his teammates' total points to find the team's total points:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ points} + 200 \\text{ points} = 300 \\text{ points} \\]\n\nTherefore, the team's total points after 5 games is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
