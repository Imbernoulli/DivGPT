There are 6 tables in the classroom with 3 students currently sitting at each table. Sally said 3 girls went to the bathroom, and three times more students went to the canteen. Elliott said that 2 groups of students have recently been added to their class, and each group has 4 students in it. None of these students are in the class right now. Lucas pointed out that a few foreign exchange students have joined the class; 3 from Germany, 3 from France, and 3 from Norway. These students are also missing. How many students are supposed to be in the class?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total number of students supposed to be in Miss Smith's second period English class, we need to account for all the students currently present and those who are absent. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of students currently in the class:**\n   - There are 6 tables.\n   - Each table has 3 students.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 3 = 18\n   \\]\n   So, there are 18 students currently in the class.\n\n2. **Determine the number of students who went to the bathroom:**\n   - Sally said 3 girls went to the bathroom.\n   \\[\n   3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of students who went to the canteen:**\n   - Sally said three times more students went to the canteen.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of students who are absent from the bathroom and the canteen:**\n   \\[\n   3 + 9 = 12\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the number of new students added to the class:**\n   - Elliott said 2 groups of students have recently been added.\n   - Each group has 4 students.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the number of foreign exchange students:**\n   - Lucas pointed out that 3 students from Germany, 3 from France, and 3 from Norway have joined.\n   \\[\n   3 + 3 + 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the total number of students absent from the new groups and the foreign exchange students:**\n   \\[\n   8 + 9 = 17\n   \\]\n\n8. **Calculate the total number of students supposed to be in the class:**\n   - Add the number of students currently in the class to the total number of students absent.\n   \\[\n   18 + 12 + 17 = 47\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students supposed to be in the class is \\boxed{47}.",
