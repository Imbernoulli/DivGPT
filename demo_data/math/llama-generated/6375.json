        "To determine the combined distance that Jamir, Sarah, and Julien swim over the course of a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Julien's weekly swimming distance:**\n   Julien swims 50 meters per day. Over a week (7 days), the total distance he swims is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ meters/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 350 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Sarah's daily swimming distance:**\n   Sarah swims twice the distance Julien swims.

Over a week (7 days), the total distance she swims is:\n   \\[\n   100 \\text{ meters/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 700 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine Jamir's daily swimming distance:**\n   Jamir swims 20 more meters per day than Sarah. Therefore, his daily swimming distance is:\n   \\[\n   100 \\text{ meters} + 20 \\text{ meters} = 120 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine Jamir's weekly swimming distance:**\n   Jamir swims 120 meters per day. Over a week (7 days), the total distance he swims is:\n   \\[\n   120 \\text{ meters/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 840 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the combined weekly swimming distance for all three:**\n   Add the weekly distances swum by Julien, Sarah, and Jamir:\n   \\[\n   350 \\text{ meters} + 700 \\text{ meters} + 840 \\text{ meters} = 1890 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the combined distance for Jamir, Sarah, and Julien for the whole week is \\(\\boxed{1890}\\) meters.",

Calculate the total distance each person swims in a week (7 days):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Julien's weekly distance} = 50 \\times 7 = 350 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sarah's weekly distance} = 100 \\times 7 = 700 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jamir's weekly distance} = 120 \\times 7 = 840 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n5. Find the combined distance for all three of them for the whole week:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined weekly distance} = \\text{Julien's weekly distance} + \\text{Sarah's weekly distance} + \\text{Jamir's weekly distance} = 350 + 700 + 840 = 1890 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the combined distance for Jamir, Sarah, and Julien for the whole week is \\(\\boxed{1890}\\).",
        "To find the combined distance that Jamir, Sarah, and Julien swim in a week, we need to determine the distance each person swims per day and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).\n\nFirst, we know that Julien swims 50 meters per day. Let's denote the distance Julien swims per day as \\( J \\). Therefore, \\( J = 50 \\) meters.\n\nNext, we know that Sarah swims twice the distance Julien swims. So, the distance Sarah swims per day is \\( 2J \\). Substituting the value of \\( J \\):\n\\[\n2J = 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nJamir swims 20 more meters per day than Sarah. So, the distance Jamir swims per day is \\( 2J + 20 \\). Substituting the value of \\( 2J \\):\n\\[\n2J + 20 = 100 + 20 = 120 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total distance each person swims in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily distance by 7.\n\nFor Julien:\n\\[\n7 \\times 50 = 350 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nFor Sarah:\n\\[\n7 \\times 100 = 700 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nFor Jamir:\n\\[\n7 \\times 120 = 840 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the total distances swum by Jamir, Sarah, and Julien in a week:\n\\[\n350 + 700 + 840 = 1890 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThus, the combined distance for the three of them for the whole week is \\(\\boxed{1890}\\)."
