        "To determine how many chocolate bars Mike and Rita received combined, we start by finding out how many bars each person got. The box contains 12 bars and is shared equally between Mike, Rita, and Anita. Therefore, we divide the total number of bars by the number of people:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of bars each person gets} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\]\n\nSince Mike and Rita each get 4 bars, we add the number of bars Mike gets to the number of bars Rita gets to find the total number of bars they received combined:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of bars Mike and Rita get} = 4 + 4 = 8 \\]\n\nThus, the number of bars Mike and Rita got combined is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
