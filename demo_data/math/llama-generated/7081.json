        "To determine how many of Toby's friends are girls, we start by finding the total number of Toby's friends. We know that 55% of his friends are boys and he has 33 friends who are boys. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:\n\n\\[ 0.55 \\times \\text{total friends} = 33 \\]\n\nTo find the total number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.55:\n\n\\[ \\text{total friends} = \\frac{33}{0.55} \\]\n\nNext, we perform the division:\n\n\\[ \\text{total friends} = 60 \\]\n\nNow that we know Toby has 60 friends in total, we can find out how many of them are girls. Since the rest of his friends are girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of friends:\n\n\\[ \\text{number of girls} = 60 - 33 \\]\n\nPerforming the subtraction gives us:\n\n\\[ \\text{number of girls} = 27 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of friends Toby has who are girls is \\(\\boxed{27}\\).",
