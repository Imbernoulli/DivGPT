Divide the total length of the equal pieces by the number of equal pieces to find the length of each equal piece.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Convert the total length of the rope from centimeters to millimeters.\n   \\[\n   1165 \\text{ cm} = 1165 \\times 10 = 11650 \\text{ mm}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the total length of the remaining pieces.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of remaining pieces} = 154 - 150 = 4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total length of remaining pieces} = 4 \\times 100 \\text{ mm} = 400 \\text{ mm}\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract the total length of the remaining pieces from the total length of the rope to find the total length of the equal pieces.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total length of equal pieces} = 11650 \\text{ mm} - 400 \\text{ mm} = 11250 \\text{ mm}\n   \\]\n\n4. Divide the total length of the equal pieces by the number of equal pieces to find the length of each equal piece.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of each equal piece} = \\frac{11250 \\text{ mm}}{150} = 75 \\text{ mm}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of each of the equal pieces is \\(\\boxed{75}\\) millimeters."
