        "To determine the cost of feeding Sylvie's turtles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of food required for all the turtles.\n2.

This means each pound of turtle weight requires:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ ounce} \\div \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ pound} = 2 \\text{ ounces per pound} \\]\n\nSince Sylvie has 30 pounds of turtles, the total amount of food required is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ pounds} \\times 2 \\text{ ounces per pound} = 60 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many jars of food are needed.**\n\nEach jar contains 15 ounces of food. To find out how many jars are needed, we divide the total amount of food required by the amount of food per jar:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ ounces} \\div 15 \\text{ ounces per jar} = 4 \\text{ jars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the jars of food.**\n\nEach jar costs $2, so the total cost for 4 jars is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ jars} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per jar} = 8 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost to feed the turtles is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",
