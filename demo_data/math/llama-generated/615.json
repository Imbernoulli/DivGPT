        "To determine how many goats Max can obtain from 342 coconuts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert coconuts to crabs:**\n   - Max can trade 3 coconuts for 1 crab.\n   - Therefore, the number of crabs Max can get from 342 coconuts is calculated by dividing 342 by 3:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{342}{3} = 114\n     \\]\n   - So, Max has 114 crabs.\n\n2. **Convert crabs to goats:**\n   - Max can trade 6 crabs for 1 goat.\n   - Therefore, the number of goats Max can get from 114 crabs is calculated by dividing 114 by 6:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{114}{6} = 19\n     \\]\n   - So, Max has 19 goats.\n\nThus, the final number of goats Max will have is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).",
        "To determine how many goats Max can get from 342 coconuts, we need to follow the conversion rates step by step.\n\nFirst, we convert coconuts to crabs.
