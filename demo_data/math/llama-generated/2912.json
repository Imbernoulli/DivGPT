Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total time for the wash cycles:**\n   Each load of laundry takes 45 minutes to wash. Therefore, for 8 loads, the total time for the wash cycles is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 45 \\text{ minutes} = 360 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n   To convert this time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n   \\[\n   360 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total time for the dry cycles:**\n   Each load of laundry takes 1 hour to dry. Therefore, for 8 loads, the total time for the dry cycles is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 1 \\text{ hour} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total time for both wash and dry cycles:**\n   To find the total time required to complete all 8 loads of laundry, we add the total time for the wash cycles and the total time for the dry cycles:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ hours} + 8 \\text{ hours} = 14 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total time required to complete the entire set of laundry is \\(\\boxed{14}\\) hours.",
        "To determine the total time required to complete all 8 loads of laundry, we need to consider both the washing and drying times for each load.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total washing time for all 8 loads:\n- Each load takes 45 minutes to wash.\n- Therefore, the total washing time is:\n  \\[\n  8 \\text{ loads} \\times 45 \\text{ minutes/load} = 360 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total drying time for all 8 loads:\n- Each load takes 1 hour to dry.\n- Therefore, the total drying time is:\n  \\[\n  8 \\text{ loads} \\times 1 \\text{ hour/load} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we need to convert the total washing time from minutes to hours to add it to the total drying time:\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n- Therefore, the total washing time in hours is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{360 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes/hour}} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total washing time and the total drying time to find the total time required to complete all the laundry:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ hours} + 8 \\text{ hours} = 14 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time required to complete the entire set of laundry is \\boxed{14} hours.",
