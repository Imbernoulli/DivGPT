        "To determine how many pounds Vinny lost throughout the fifth month, we need to calculate his weight at the end of each month before the fifth month and then find the difference between his weight at the start of the fifth month and his weight at the end of the fifth month.\n\n1. **Initial weight**: Vinny started at 300 pounds.\n2. **Weight after the first month**: He lost 20 pounds.\n   \\[\n   300 - 20 = 280 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n3. **Weight after the second month**: He lost half of the weight lost in the first month, which is \\(20 / 2 = 10\\) pounds.\n   \\[\n   280 - 10 = 270 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n4. **Weight after the third month**: He lost half of the weight lost in the second month, which is \\(10 / 2 = 5\\) pounds.\n   \\[\n   270 - 5 = 265 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n5. **Weight after the fourth month**: He lost half of the weight lost in the third month, which is \\(5 / 2 = 2.5\\) pounds.\n   \\[\n   265 - 2.5 = 262.5 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n6. **Weight at the start of the fifth month**: He worked harder to lose extra weight, but we know heute 250.5 pounds at the end of the fifth month.

        "Let's start by calculating the weight Vinny lost each month up to the fourth month. Initially, Vinny weighed 300 pounds and lost 20 pounds in the first month.

So, his weight at the end of the first month is:\n  \\[\n  300 - 20 = 280 \\text{ pounds}\n  \\]\n- In the second month, he lost half of the weight he lost in the first month, which is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\text{ pounds}\n  \\]\n  So, his weight at the end of the second month is:\n  \\[\n  280 - 10 = 270 \\text{ pounds}\n  \\]\n- In the third month, he lost half of the weight he lost in the second month, which is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ pounds}\n  \\]\n  So, his weight at the end of the third month is:\n  \\[\n  270 - 5 = 265 \\text{ pounds}\n  \\]\n- In the fourth month, he lost half of the weight he lost in the third month, which is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \\text{ pounds}\n  \\]\n  So, his weight at the end of the fourth month is:\n  \\[\n  265 - 2.5 = 262.5 \\text{ pounds}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we know that Vinny's weight at the end of the fifth month was 250.5 pounds. To find out how much weight he lost in the fifth month, we subtract his weight at the end of the fourth month from his weight at the end of the fifth month:\n\\[\n262.5 - 250.5 = 12 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pounds Vinny lost throughout the fifth month is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
