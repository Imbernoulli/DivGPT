Every row of corn contains 70 ears. A bag of corn seeds contains 48 seeds and you need 2 seeds per ear of corn. He pays the kids $1.5 per row. Afterward, the kids are so hungry that they end up spending half their money on dinner. The dinner cost $36 per kid. How many bags of corn seeds did each kid use?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Convert the total number of seeds into bags of corn seeds.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of ears of corn planted by each kid.**\n\nThe farmer pays the kids $1.5 per row, and each kid spends half their money on dinner. The dinner cost $36 per kid, so the total amount of money each kid received is:\n\\[ 36 \\times 2 = 72 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince each kid powers $1.5 per row, the number of rows each kid planted is:\n\\[ 72 \\div 1.5 = 48 \\text{ rows} \\]\n\nEach row contains 70 ears of corn, so the total number of ears of corn planted by each kid is:\n\\[ 48 \\times 70 = 3360 \\text{ ears} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of seeds used by each kid.**\n\nSince you need 2 seeds per ear of corn, the total number of seeds used by each kid is:\n\\[ 3360 \\times 2 = 6720 \\text{ seeds} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert the total number of seeds into bags of corn seeds.**\n\nEach bag of corn seeds contains 48 seeds, so the number of bags of corn seeds each kid used is:\n\\[ 6720 \\div 48 = 140 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bags of corn seeds each kid used is:\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]",
        "To determine how many bags of corn seeds each kid used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of ears of corn planted by all the kids.\n2. Determine the total number of seeds needed.\n3. Calculate how many seeds each kid used.\n4. Determine how many bags of corn seeds each kid used.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of ears of corn planted by all the kids.**\n\nFirst, we find out how many rows of corn each kid planted. Since each kid spends half their money on dinner and the dinner costs $36 per kid, the total amount of money each kid earned is:\n\\[ \\text{Money earned per kid} = \\text{Dinner cost per kid} \\times 2 = 36 \\times 2 = 72 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince the kids are paid $1.5 per row, the number of rows each kid planted is:\n\\[ \\text{Rows planted per kid} = \\frac{\\text{Money earned per kid}}{\\text{Payment per row}} = \\frac{72}{1.5} = 48 \\text{ rows} \\]\n\nSince there are 4 kids, the total number of rows planted by all the kids is:\n\\[ \\text{Total rows planted} = \\text{Rows planted per kid} \\times \\text{Number of kids} = 48 \\times 4 = 192 \\text{ rows} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of seeds needed.**\n\nEach row contains 70 ears of corn, so the total number of ears of corn planted is:\n\\[ \\text{Total ears of corn} = \\text{Total rows planted} \\times \\text{Ears per row} = 192 \\times 70 = 13440 \\text{ ears} \\]\n\nSince you need 2 seeds per ear of corn, the total number of seeds needed is:\n\\[ \\text{Total seeds needed} = \\text{Total ears of corn} \\times 2 = 13440 \\times 2 = 26880 \\text{ seeds} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many seeds each kid used.**\n\nSince there are 4 kids, the number of seeds each kid used is:\n\\[ \\text{Seeds used per kid} = \\frac{\\text{Total seeds needed}}{\\text{Number of kids}} = \\frac{26880}{4} = 6720 \\text{ seeds} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine how many bags of corn seeds each kid used.**\n\nSince each bag contains 48 seeds, the number of bags each kid used is:\n\\[ \\text{Bags used per kid} = \\frac{\\text{Seeds used per kid}}{\\text{Seeds per bag}} = \\frac{6720}{48} = 140 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bags of corn seeds each kid used is:\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]"
