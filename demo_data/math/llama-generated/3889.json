        "To determine how many chickens Mr. Fredrickson has that do not lay eggs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of roosters.\n2. Calculate the number of hens.\n3.

Determine how many hens lay eggs.\n4. Determine how many hens do not lay eggs.\n5. Add the number of roosters to the number of hens that do not lay eggs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of roosters. Since 1/4 of the chickens are roosters, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of roosters} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 80 = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of hens. Since the rest of the chickens are hens, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of hens} = 80 - 20 = 60\n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine how many hens lay eggs. Since only three-fourths of the hens lay eggs, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of hens that lay eggs} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 60 = 45\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hens that do not lay eggs is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of hens that do not lay eggs} = 60 - 45 = 15\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of roosters to the number of hens that do not lay eggs to find the total number of chickens that do not lay eggs:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of chickens that do not lay eggs} = 20 + 15 = 35\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of chickens Mr. Fredrickson has that do not lay eggs is \\boxed{35}.",

Since 1/4 of these chickens are roosters, we calculate the number of roosters as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of roosters} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 80 = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of hens:**\n   The rest of the chickens are hens. Therefore, the number of hens is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of hens} = 80 - \\text{Number of roosters} = 80 - 20 = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of hens that lay eggs:**\n   Only three-fourths of the hens lay eggs. Therefore, the number of hens that lay eggs is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of hens that lay eggs} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 60 = 45\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of hens that do not lay eggs:**\n   The number of hens that do not lay eggs is the total number of hens minus the number of hens that lay eggs:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of hens that do not lay eggs} = 60 - \\text{Number of hens that lay eggs} = 60 - 45 = 15\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of chickens that do not lay eggs:**\n   The total number of chickens that do not lay eggs includes all the roosters and the hens that do not lay eggs:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of chickens that do not lay eggs} = \\text{Number of roosters} + \\text{Number of hens that do not lay eggs} = 20 + 15 = 35\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of chickens Mr. Fredrickson has that do not lay eggs is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",

Add the number of roosters and the number of hens that do not lay eggs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of roosters. Since Mrs. Fredrickson has 80 chickens and 1/4 of them are roosters, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of roosters} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 80 = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of hens. The rest of the chickens are hens, so we subtract the number of roosters from the total number of chickens:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of hens} = 80 - 20 = 60\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many hens lay eggs. Since only three-fourths of the hens lay eggs, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of hens that lay eggs} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 60 = 45\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many hens do not lay eggs. We subtract the number of hens that lay eggs from the total number of hens:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of hens that do not lay eggs} = 60 - 45 = 15\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of roosters and the number of hens that do not lay eggs to find the total number of chickens that do not lay eggs:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of chickens that do not lay eggs} = 20 + 15 = 35\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of chickens Mr. Fredrickson has that do not lay eggs is \\boxed{35}.",
