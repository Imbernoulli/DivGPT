        "To determine the total number of pills Joey will take in a week, we need to calculate the number of pills he takes each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's list the number of pills Joey takes each day:\n- On the first day, Joey takes 1 pill.\n- On the second day, Joey takes \\(1 + 2 = 3\\) pills.\n- On the third day, Joey takes \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) pills.\n- On the fourth day, Joey takes \\(5 + 2 = 7\\) pills.\n- On the fifth day, Joey takes \\(7 + 2 = 9\\) pills.\n- On the sixth day, Joey takes \\(9 + 2 = 11\\) pills.\n- On the seventh day, Joey takes \\(11 + 2 = 13\\) pills.\n\nNow, we sum the number of pills taken each day:\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13\n\\]\n\nWe can add these numbers step by step:\n\\[\n(1 + 3) + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = 4 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13\n\\]\n\\[\n(4 + 5) + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = 9 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13\n\\]\n\\[\n(9 + 7) + 9 + 11 + 13 = 16 + 9 + 11 + 13\n\\]\n\\[\n(16 + 9) + 11 + 13 = 25 + 11 + 13\n\\]\n\\[\n(25 + 11) + 13 = 36 + 13\n\\]\n\\[\n36 + 13 = 49\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of pills Joey will take in a week is \\(\\boxed{49}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of pills Joey will take in a week, we need to calculate the number of pills he takes each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's identify the number of pills Joey takes each day:\n- On the first day, he takes 1 pill.\n- On the second day, he takes \\(1 + 2 = 3\\) pills.\n- On the third day, he takes \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) pills.\n- On the fourth day, he takes \\(5 + 2 = 7\\) pills.\n- On the fifth day, he takes \\(7 + 2 = 9\\) pills.\n- On the sixth day, he takes \\(9 + 2 = 11\\) pills.\n- On the seventh day, he takes \\(11 + 2 = 13\\) pills.\n\nNow, we sum the number of pills taken each day:\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13\n\\]\n\nWe can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum \\(S_n\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(l\\) is the last term.\n\nIn this case:\n- \\(n = 7\\) (since there are 7 days in a week)\n- \\(a = 1\\) (the first term)\n- \\(l = 13\\) (the last term)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[\nS_7 = \\frac{7}{2} \\times (1 + 13) = \\frac{7}{2} \\times 14 = 7 \\times 7 = 49\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pills Joey will take in a week is \\(\\boxed{49}\\).",
