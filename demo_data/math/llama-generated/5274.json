        "To determine how many more oranges Leif has than apples, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of apples on Leif's apple tree.\n2. Identify the number of oranges on Leif's orange tree.\n3. Calculate the difference between the number of oranges and the number of apples.\n\nFirst, we know that Leif's apple tree has 14 apples. Next, we know that his orange tree has 2 dozen oranges. Since one dozen equals 12, 2 dozen oranges is calculated as:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ oranges} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more oranges there are than apples. We do this by subtracting the number of apples from the number of oranges:\n\\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, Leif has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) more oranges than apples.",

Since one dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of oranges as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\nSo, Leif has 24 oranges.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of oranges and the number of apples:\n\\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \\]\nTherefore, Leif has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) more oranges than apples.",
