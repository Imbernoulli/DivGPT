        "To determine how many more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls Jill bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of red bouncy balls.\n2. Calculate the total number of yellow bouncy balls.\n3. Find the difference between the total number of red bouncy balls and the total number of yellow bouncy balls.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of red bouncy balls. Jill bought 5 packs of red bouncy balls, and each pack contains 18 bouncy balls. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of bouncy balls per pack:\n\\[ 5 \\times 18 = 90 \\]\nTherefore, Jill bought 90 red bouncy balls.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of yellow bouncy balls. Jill bought 4 packs of yellow bouncy balls, and each pack contains 18 bouncy balls. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of bouncy balls per pack:\n\\[ 4 \\times 18 = 72 \\]\nTherefore, Jill bought 72 yellow bouncy balls.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the total number of red bouncy balls and the total number of yellow bouncy balls:\n\\[ 90 - 72 = 18 \\]\nTherefore, Jill bought 18 more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]",

So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of bouncy balls per pack:\n\\[ 5 \\times 18 = 90 \\]\nTherefore, Jill bought 90 red bouncy balls.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of yellow bouncy balls. Jill bought 4 packs of yellow bouncy balls, and each pack contains 18 bouncy balls. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of bouncy balls per pack:\n\\[ 4 \\times 18 = 72 \\]\nTherefore, Jill bought 72 yellow bouncy balls.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of red bouncy balls and the number of yellow bouncy balls:\n\\[ 90 - 72 = 18 \\]\nTherefore, Jill bought 18 more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]",

So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of bouncy balls per pack:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ packs} \\times 18 \\text{ bouncy balls per pack} = 90 \\text{ red bouncy balls} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of yellow bouncy balls. Jill bought 4 packs of yellow bouncy balls, and each pack contains 18 bouncy balls. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of bouncy balls per pack:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ packs} \\times 18 \\text{ bouncy balls per pack} = 72 \\text{ yellow bouncy balls} \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the number of red bouncy balls and the number of yellow bouncy balls:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ red bouncy balls} - 72 \\text{ yellow bouncy balls} = 18 \\text{ more red bouncy balls} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jill bought \\(\\boxed{18}\\) more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls.",
