        "To determine in how many years Arman's age will be 40, we start by finding out Arman's current age. We know that his sister is 2 years old four years ago, so we can calculate her current age as follows:\n\n\\[\n2 + 4 = 6 \\text{ years old}\n\\]\n\nSince Arman is six times older than his sister, we can calculate his current age by multiplying her current age by 6:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 6 = 36 \\text{ years old}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine in how many years Arman's age will be 40.
