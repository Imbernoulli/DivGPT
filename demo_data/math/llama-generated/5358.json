        "To determine how many pieces of cake each of Juelz's three sisters received, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cake pieces eaten by Forest and his friends.\n2. Determine the number of cake pieces remaining after they ate.\n3. Divide the remaining pieces equally among Juelz's three sisters.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of cake pieces eaten by Forest and his friends. The cake originally had 240 pieces, and they ate 60% of them. Therefore, the number of pieces eaten is:\n\\[\n240 \\times \\frac{60}{100} = 240 \\times 0.60 = 144\n\\]\nSo, after eating, the number of cake pieces remaining is:\n\\[\n240 - 144 = 96\n\\]\nNext, Juelz divided the remaining 96 pieces equally among his three sisters. Therefore, the number of pieces each sister received is:\n\\[\n96 \\div 3 = 32\n\\]\nThus, the number of pieces of cake each sister received is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
