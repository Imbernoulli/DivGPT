        "To determine the average time Tony spends to get to the store, we need to calculate the time it takes for each trip and then find the average of these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes Tony to walk to the store on Sunday. Since he walks at a speed of 2 miles per hour and the store is 4 miles away, the time it takes him to walk is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time to walk} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ miles}}{2 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nConverting this time into minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\\[\n2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes Tony to run to the store on Tuesday and Thursday. Since he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour and the store is 4 miles away, the time it takes him to run is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time to run} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ miles}}{10 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 0.4 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nConverting this time into minutes:\n\\[\n0.4 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 24 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we have the times for each trip:\n- Sunday: 120 minutes\n- Tuesday: 24 minutes\n- Thursday: 24 minutes\n\nTo find the average time, we add these times together and then divide by the number of trips (which is 3):\n\\[\n\\text{Average time} = \\frac{120 \\text{ minutes} + 24 \\text{ minutes} + 24 \\text{ minutes}}{3} = \\frac{168 \\text{ minutes}}{3} = 56 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average time Tony spends to get to the store is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{56}\n\\]",

        "To find the average time Tony spends to get to the store, we need to calculate the time he spends on each day and then find the average of these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Tony spends on Sunday. Since Sunday is a weekend day, he walks to the store. The distance is 4 miles, and his walking speed is 2 miles per hour. The time taken to walk to the store is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Time on Sunday} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ miles}}{2 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert this time to minutes:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Tony spends on Tuesday. Since Tuesday is a weekday, he runs to the store. The distance is 4 miles, and his running speed is 10 miles per hour. The time taken to run to the store is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Time on Tuesday} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ miles}}{10 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 0.4 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nConverting this time to minutes:\n\\[\n0.4 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 24 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Tony spends on Thursday. Since Thursday is a weekday, he runs to the store. The distance is 4 miles, and his running speed is 10 miles per hour. The time taken to run to the store is the same as on Tuesday:\n\\[\n\\text{Time on Thursday} = 24 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the average time spent to get to the store over these three days. The average time is the sum of the times divided by the number of days:\n\\[\n\\text{Average time} = \\frac{\\text{Time on Sunday} + \\text{Time on Tuesday} + \\text{Time on Thursday}}{3} = \\frac{120 \\text{ minutes} + 24 \\text{ minutes} + 24 \\text{ minutes}}{3} = \\frac{168 \\text{ minutes}}{3} = 56 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average time Tony spends to get to the store is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{56}\n\\]",
