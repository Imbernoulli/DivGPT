        "To determine how much money Jerry makes, we first need to calculate the cost of piercing each ear. Jerry charges 50% more to pierce an ear than to pierce a nose. Since the cost to pierce a nose is $20, the cost to pierce an ear is:\n\n\\[ 20 + 0.5 \\times 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total earnings from piercing the noses. Jerry pierces 6 noses, so the total earnings from piercing noses is:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times 20 = 120 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total earnings from piercing the ears. Jerry pierces 9 ears, so the total earnings from piercing ears is:\n\n\\[ 9 \\times 30 = 270 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the earnings from piercing noses and ears to find the total amount of money Jerry makes:\n\n\\[ 120 + 270 = 390 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Jerry makes is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{390} \\]",
