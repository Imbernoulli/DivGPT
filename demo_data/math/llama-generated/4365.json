        "To determine the total weight gain of Orlando, Jose, and Fernando at the family reunion, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the weight gain of each family member.\n2. Calculate the weight gain of Jose.\n3. Calculate the weight gain of Fernando.\n4. Sum the weight gains of all three family members.\n\nFirst, we know that Orlando gained 5 pounds:\n\\[ \\text{Weight gain of Orlando} = 5 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the weight gain of Jose. Jose gained two pounds more than twice what Orlando gained:\n\\[ \\text{Weight gain of Jose} = 2 \\times \\text{Weight gain of Orlando} + 2 = 2 \\times 5 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the weight gain of Fernando. Fernando gained 3 pounds less than half of what Jose gained:\n\\[ \\text{Weight gain of Fernando} = \\frac{\\text{Weight gain of Jose}}{2} - 3 = \\frac{12}{2} - 3 = 6 - 3 = 3 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the weight gains of Orlando, Jose, and Fernando:\n\\[ \\text{Total weight gain} = \\text{Weight gain of Orlando} + \\text{Weight gain of Jose} + \\text{Weight gain of Fernando} = 5 + 12 + 3 = 20 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThus, the total weight gain of the three family members is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
