Therefore, we perform the following calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 42 = 14\n\\]\n\nThis means that 14 baby sea turtles were swept to the sea. To find out how many are still on the sand, we subtract the number of turtles swept to the sea from the total number of turtles:\n\n\\[\n42 - 14 = 28\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of baby sea turtles still on the sand is \\boxed{28}.",
