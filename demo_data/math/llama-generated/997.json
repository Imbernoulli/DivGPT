        "To determine the total number of oysters Crabby and Squido eat together, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many oysters Squido eats.\n2. Calculate how many oysters Crabby needs to eat.\n3. Add the number of oysters Crabby eats to the number of oysters Squido eats.\n\nFirst, we know that Squido eats 200 oysters.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many oysters Crabby has to eat. According to the problem, Crabby has to eat at least twice as many oysters as Squido. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[ 2 \\times 200 = 400 \\]\nSo, Crabby eats 400 oysters.\n\nNow, we add the number of oysters Crabby eats to the number of oysters Squido eats to find the total number of oysters they eat together:\n\\[ 200 + 400 = 600 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of oysters they eat altogether is \\(\\boxed{600}\\).",
