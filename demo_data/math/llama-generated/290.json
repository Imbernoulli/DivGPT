        "To determine how much it will cost Janet to buy enough cat litter to last 210 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of weeks in 210 days:**\n   Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide 210 days by 7:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{210}{7} = 30 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total amount of cat litter needed:**\n   Janet changes out the litter weekly, and each litter box holds 15 pounds.
