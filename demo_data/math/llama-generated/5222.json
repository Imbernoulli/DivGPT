        "Let's start by determining Alexander's age. We know that the sum of Asaf's and Alexander's ages is 140, and Asaf is 50 years old. So, we can write the equation for their ages as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Asaf's age} + \\text{Alexander's age} = 140\n\\]\n\nSubstituting Asaf's age into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n50 + \\text{Alexander's age} = 140\n\\]\n\nTo find Alexander's age, we subtract 50 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Alexander's age} = 140 - 50 = 90\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of pencils Asaf has.
