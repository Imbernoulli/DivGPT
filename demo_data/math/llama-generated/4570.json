        "To determine the total number of marbles Katie has, we need to calculate the number of each color of marble and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that Katie has 13 pink marbles. Next, we need to find out how many orange marbles she has. According to the problem, she has 9 fewer orange marbles than pink marbles. Therefore, we can calculate the number of orange marbles as follows:\n\\[\n13 - 9 = 4\n\\]\nSo, Katie has 4 orange marbles.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many purple marbles she has. The problem states that she has 4 times as many purple marbles as orange marbles. Therefore, we can calculate the number of purple marbles as follows:\n\\[\n4 \\times 4 = 16\n\\]\nSo, Katie has 16 purple marbles.\n\nNow, we add up the number of pink, orange, and purple marbles to find the total number of marbles Katie has:\n\\[\n13 + 4 + 16 = 33\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of marbles Katie has is \\boxed{33}.",
