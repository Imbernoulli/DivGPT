Since Mona has 9 crackers, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Nicholas's crackers} = \\text{Mona's crackers} + 6\n   \\]\n   Substituting the value of Mona's crackers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Nicholas's crackers} = 9 + 6 = 15\n   \\]\n\nThus, Nicholas has \\(\\boxed{15}\\) crackers.",
        "To determine how many crackers Nicholas has, we need to first find out how many crackers Mona has. We know from the problem that Marcus has three times as many cheese crackers as Mona. Since Marcus has 27 crackers, we can set up the following equation to find out how many crackers Mona has:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of crackers Mona has} = \\frac{\\text{Number of crackers Marcus has}}{3} = \\frac{27}{3} = 9 \\]\n\nNow that we know Mona has 9 crackers, we can find out how many crackers Nicholas has.
