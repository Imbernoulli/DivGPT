        "To determine the total time it will take Amelia to wash and dry all three loads of laundry, we need to add the times for each load individually. Since she does one load at a time, the time for each load will not overlap.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time for the load of whites:\n- Washing time: 72 minutes\n- Drying time: 50 minutes\n- Total time for whites: \\(72 + 50 = 122\\) minutes\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time for the load of darks:\n- Washing time: 58 minutes\n- Drying time: 65 minutes\n- Total time for darks: \\(58 + 65 = 123\\) minutes\n\nThen, let's calculate the total time for the load of colors:\n- Washing time: 45 minutes\n- Drying time: 54 minutes\n- Total time for colors: \\(45 + 54 = 99\\) minutes\n\nNow, we add the total times for all three loads:\n- Total time for whites: 122 minutes\n- Total time for darks: 123 minutes\n- Total time for colors: 99 minutes\n- Total time for all three loads: \\(122 + 123 + 99 = 344\\) minutes\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take Amelia to wash and dry all three loads is \\(\\boxed{344}\\) minutes.",
        "To determine the total time it will take Amelia to wash and dry all three loads of laundry, we need to consider the time for each load separately and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time for the load of whites:\n- Washing time: 72 minutes\n- Drying time: 50 minutes\n- Total time for whites: \\( 72 + 50 = 122 \\) minutes\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time for the load of darks:\n- Washing time: 58 minutes\n- Drying time: 65 minutes\n- Total time for darks: \\( 58 + 65 = 123 \\) minutes\n\nThen, let's calculate the total time for the load of colors:\n- Washing time: 45 minutes\n- Drying time: 54 minutes\n- Total time for colors: \\( 45 + 54 = 99 \\) minutes\n\nNow, we sum the total times for all three loads:\n\\[\n122 + 123 + 99\n\\]\n\nFirst, add 122 and 123:\n\\[\n122 + 123 = 245\n\\]\n\nNext, add 245 and 99:\n\\[\n245 + 99 = 344\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take Amelia to wash and dry all three loads of laundry is \\(\\boxed{344}\\) minutes.",
