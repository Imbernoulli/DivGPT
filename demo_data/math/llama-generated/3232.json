        "Let's denote the number of loonies Antonella initially had as \\( l \\) and the number of toonies as \\( t \\).

Since each loonie is worth $1 and each toonie is worth $2, the total value of the coins is:\n\\[ l \\cdot 1 + t \\cdot 2 = l + 2t. \\]\n\nAfter buying a $3 Frappuccino, Antonella has $11 left.
