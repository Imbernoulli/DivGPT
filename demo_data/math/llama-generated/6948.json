The net calorie deficit per day is:\n\\[ 2300 - 1800 = 500 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total calorie deficit required to lose 10 pounds.**\n\nJohn needs to burn 4000 calories to lose 1 pound. Therefore, to lose 10 pounds, he needs to burn:\n\\[ 10 \\times 4000 = 40000 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of days needed to achieve the total calorie deficit.**\n\nSince John has a net calorie deficit of 500 calories per day, the number of days required to burn 40000 calories is:\n\\[ \\frac{40000}{500} = 80 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nThus, it will take John \\(\\boxed{80}\\) days to lose 10 pounds.",
        "To determine how many days it will take John to lose 10 pounds, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**\n   John eats 1800 calories a day and burns 2300 calories a day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily calorie deficit} = \\text{Calories burned} - \\text{Calories consumed}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily calorie deficit} = 2300 - 1800 = 500 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total calorie deficit required to lose 10 pounds:**\n   John needs to burn 4000 calories to lose 1 pound.

Determine the total calorie deficit required to lose 10 pounds.\n3. Calculate the number of days needed to achieve the total calorie deficit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily calorie deficit. John eats 1800 calories a day and burns 2300 calories a day. The daily calorie deficit is:\n\\[ 2300 - 1800 = 500 \\text{ calories per day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total calorie deficit required to lose 10 pounds. Since John needs to burn 4000 calories to lose 1 pound, to lose 10 pounds, he needs to burn:\n\\[ 10 \\times 4000 = 40000 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of days needed to achieve a total calorie deficit of 40000 calories. Since he has a daily calorie deficit of 500 calories, the number of days required is:\n\\[ \\frac{40000}{500} = 80 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take John \\boxed{80} days to lose 10 pounds.",
