        "To determine how many cars Ann and Alfred counted, we start with the information given about Jared's count. Jared counted 300 cars, which is 15% fewer than Ann. This means that Ann counted 115% of the number of cars Jared counted. We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ann's count} = 300 \\times 1.15 \\]\n\nCalculating the right-hand side, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ann's count} = 300 \\times 1.15 = 345 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Ann counted 7 more cars than Alfred. Therefore, we can express Alfred's count as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Alfred's count} = \\text{Ann's count} - 7 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value we found for Ann's count, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Alfred's count} = 345 - 7 = 338 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of cars counted by Jared, Ann, and Alfred. We do this by adding their individual counts together:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total count} = \\text{Jared's count} + \\text{Ann's count} + \\text{Alfred's count} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total count} = 300 + 345 + 338 \\]\n\nAdding these values together, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total count} = 983 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cars counted by Jared, Ann, and Alfred is \\(\\boxed{983}\\).",
