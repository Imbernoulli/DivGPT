Olivia wants one scoop of vanilla and one scoop of strawberry:\n   - Vanilla: 1 scoop\n   - Strawberry: 1 scoop\n\n4. Shannon wants twice as much as Olivia:\n   - Olivia's total: 2 scoops (1 vanilla + 1 strawberry)\n   - Shannon's total: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) scoops (2 vanilla + 2 strawberry)\n\nNow, we sum up the scoops required for each flavor:\n\n- **Vanilla:**\n  - Ethan: 1 scoop\n  - Olivia: 1 scoop\n  - Shannon: 2 scoops\n  - Total vanilla: \\(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\\) scoops\n\n- **Chocolate:**\n  - Ethan: 1 scoop\n  - Lucas, Danny, and Connor: 6 scoops\n  - Total chocolate: \\(1 + 6 = 7\\) scoops\n\n- **Strawberry:**\n  - Olivia: 1 scoop\n  - Shannon: 2 scoops\n  - Total strawberry: \\(1 + 2 = 3\\) scoops\n\nFinally, we subtract the total scoops consumed from the initial number of scoops available:\n\n- **Vanilla left:**\n  \\[\n  10 - 4 = 6\n  \\]\n\n- **Chocolate left:**\n  \\[\n  10 - 7 = 3\n  \\]\n\n- **Strawberry left:**\n  \\[\n  10 - 3 = 7\n  \\]\n\nAdding up the scoops left in all flavors:\n\\[\n6 + 3 + 7 = 16\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of scoops of ice cream left is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
