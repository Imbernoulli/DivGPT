        "To determine the total number of tickets Connie redeemed today, we need to account for the tickets she spent on each item. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Let \\( T \\) be the total number of tickets Connie redeemed.\n2. She spent half of her tickets on a stuffed koala bear. Therefore, she spent \\( \\frac{T}{2} \\) tickets on the koala bear.\n3. She spent 10 tickets on a pair of earbuds.\n4. She spent 15 tickets on glow bracelets.\n\nThe total number of tickets spent is the sum of the tickets spent on the koala bear, the earbuds, and the glow bracelets. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{T}{2} + 10 + 15 = T \\]\n\nNext, we combine the constants on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{T}{2} + 25 = T \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( T \\), we subtract \\( \\frac{T}{2} \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 25 = T - \\frac{T}{2} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 25 = \\frac{2T}{2} - \\frac{T}{2} \\]\n\\[ 25 = \\frac{T}{2} \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( T \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ T = 25 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ T = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of tickets Connie redeemed today is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of tickets Connie redeemed today, we need to consider each expenditure and work backwards to find the initial total.\n\n1. Let's denote the initial total number of tickets Connie had as \\( x \\).\n\n2. Connie spent half of her tickets on a stuffed koala bear, so she spent \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\) tickets on the koala bear.\n3. She spent 10 tickets on a pair of earbuds.\n4. She spent 15 tickets on glow bracelets.\n\nThe sum of these expenditures equals the initial total number of tickets. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} + 10 + 15 = x\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} + 25 = x\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we subtract \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n25 = x - \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n25 = \\frac{2x}{2} - \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\\[\n25 = \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we multiply both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx = 50\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of tickets Connie redeemed today is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
        "Let's denote the total number of tickets Connie redeemed today as \\( T \\). According to the problem, she spent half of her tickets on a stuffed koala bear, 10 tickets on a pair of earbuds, and 15 tickets on glow bracelets. We can express this information with the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T}{2} + 10 + 15 = T\n\\]\n\nFirst, we combine the constants on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T}{2} + 25 = T\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( T \\) by subtracting \\( \\frac{T}{2} \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n25 = T - \\frac{T}{2}\n\\]\n\nTo combine the terms on the right side, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \\( T \\) and \\( \\frac{T}{2} \\) is 2. So, we can rewrite \\( T \\) as \\( \\frac{2T}{2} \\):\n\n\\[\n25 = \\frac{2T}{2} - \\frac{T}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n25 = \\frac{T}{2}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( T \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[\nT = 25 \\times 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nT = 50\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of tickets Connie redeemed today is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
