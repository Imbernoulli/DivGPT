        "To determine Gracie's height, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find Grayson's height.\n2. Use Grayson's height to find Gracie's height.\n\nFirst, we know that Griffin is 61 inches tall and Grayson is 2 inches taller than Griffin. Therefore, we can calculate Grayson's height as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Grayson's height} = \\text{Griffin's height} + 2 = 61 + 2 = 63 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Gracie is 7 inches shorter than Grayson. Therefore, we can calculate Gracie's height as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Gracie's height} = \\text{Grayson's height} - 7 = 63 - 7 = 56 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThus, Gracie is \\boxed{56} inches tall.",
