        "To determine the combined distance all of the birds have traveled in the two seasons, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and then sum the distances.\n\n1. Calculate the distance traveled by one bird in the first season:\n   - The distance from lake Jim to lake Disney is 50 miles.\n   - Therefore, one bird travels 50 miles in the first season.\n\n2. Calculate the distance traveled by one bird in the second season:\n   - The distance from lake Disney to lake London is 60 miles.\n   - Therefore, one bird travels 60 miles in the second season.\n\n3.
