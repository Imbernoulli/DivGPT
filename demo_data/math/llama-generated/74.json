Therefore, we can calculate the number of goats Paddington has by adding 40 to the number of goats Washington has:\n\\[ 140 + 40 = 180 \\]\nSo, Paddington has 180 goats.\n\nNow, we add the number of goats Washington has to the number of goats Paddington has to find the total number of goats:\n\\[ 140 + 180 = 320 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of goats that Paddington and Washington have is \\(\\boxed{320}\\).",
