Therefore, the number of bike clamps given out in the morning is:\n\\[ 19 \\text{ bikes} \\times 2 \\text{ bike clamps per bike} = 38 \\text{ bike clamps} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of bike clamps given out in the afternoon. The store sells 27 bikes in the afternoon, and each bike comes with 2 free bike clamps. Therefore, the number of bike clamps given out in the afternoon is:\n\\[ 27 \\text{ bikes} \\times 2 \\text{ bike clamps per bike} = 54 \\text{ bike clamps} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of bike clamps given out in the morning and the number given out in the afternoon to find the total number of bike clamps given to customers:\n\\[ 38 \\text{ bike clamps} + 54 \\text{ bike clamps} = 92 \\text{ bike clamps} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of bike clamps given to customers is \\(\\boxed{92}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of bike clamps given to customers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bikes sold in the morning.\n2. Calculate the total number of bikes sold in the afternoon.\n3. Add the number of bikes sold in the morning and the afternoon to find the total number of bikes sold.\n4. Since each bike comes with 2 free bike clamps, multiply the total number of bikes sold by 2 to find the total number of bike clamps given.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The number of bikes sold in the morning is 19.\n2. The number of bikes sold in the afternoon is 27.\n3. The total number of bikes sold is:\n   \\[\n   19 + 27 = 46\n   \\]\n4. Since each bike comes with 2 free bike clamps, the total number of bike clamps given is:\n   \\[\n   46 \\times 2 = 92\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of bike clamps given to customers is \\(\\boxed{92}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of bike clamps given to customers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bikes sold in the month.\n2. Determine the number of bike clamps given per bike.\n3. Multiply the total number of bikes by the number of bike clamps given per bike.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of bikes sold in the month. The store sells 19 bikes in the morning and 27 bikes in the afternoon. So, the total number of bikes sold is:\n\\[ 19 + 27 = 46 \\]\n\nNext, we know that each bike sold comes with 2 free bike clamps. Therefore, the total number of bike clamps given to customers is:\n\\[ 46 \\times 2 = 92 \\]\n\nThus, the store has given \\(\\boxed{92}\\) bike clamps to customers.",
        "To determine the total number of bike clamps given to customers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bikes sold in the day.\n2. Determine the number of bike clamps given for each bike sold.\n3. Multiply the total number of bikes by the number of bike clamps given per bike.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of bikes sold in the day:\n\\[\n19 \\text{ bikes (morning)} + 27 \\text{ bikes (afternoon)} = 46 \\text{ bikes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that each bike sold comes with 2 free bike clamps. Therefore, we multiply the total number of bikes by 2:\n\\[\n46 \\text{ bikes} \\times 2 \\text{ bike clamps per bike} = 92 \\text{ bike clamps}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of bike clamps given to customers is \\boxed{92}.",
