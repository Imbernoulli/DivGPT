        "First, we determine how many strawberries Kimberly's brother picked. Since he picked 3 baskets each containing 15 strawberries, we calculate:\n\\[\n3 \\times 15 = 45\n\\]\nSo, Kimberly's brother picked 45 strawberries.\n\nNext, we calculate how many strawberries Kimberly picked. She picked 8 times the amount of strawberries her brother picked, so we have:\n\\[\n8 \\times 45 = 360\n\\]\nSo, Kimberly picked 360 strawberries.\n\nThen, we calculate how many strawberries Kimberly's parents picked. They picked 93 strawberries less than Kimberly, so we have:\n\\[\n360 - 93 = 267\n\\]\nSo, Kimberly's parents picked 267 strawberries.\n\nNow, we find the total number of strawberries picked by adding the amounts picked by Kimberly, her brother, and her parents:\n\\[\n45 + 360 + 267 = 672\n\\]\nSo, the total number of strawberries picked is 672.\n\nIf they divide the total number of strawberries equally amongst them, we need to divide 672 by 4 (Kimberly, her brother, and her parents):\n\\[\n672 \\div 4 = 168\n\\]\nSo, each person would get 168 strawberries.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{168}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many strawberries each family member would have if they divide the total number of strawberries equally, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of strawberries Kimberly's brother picked:**\n   - He picked 3 baskets.\n   - Each basket contains 15 strawberries.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 15 = 45\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of strawberries Kimberly picked:**\n   - She picked 8 times the amount her brother picked.\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 45 = 360\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of strawberries Kimberly's parents picked:**\n   - They picked 93 strawberries less than Kimberly.\n   \\[\n   360 - 93 = 267\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of strawberries picked by the family:**\n   - add the strawberries picked by her brother, Kimberly, and her parents.\n   \\[\n   45 + 360 + 267 = 672\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine how many family members there are:**\n   - Kimberly, her brother, and her parents make a total of 4 people.\n\n6. **Divide the total number of strawberries equally among the family members:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{672}{4} = 168\n   \\]\n\nThus, each family member would have \\(\\boxed{168}\\) strawberries.",
