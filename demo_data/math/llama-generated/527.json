Identify the time Uranus appears.\n3. Calculate the time difference between Uranus's appearance and 6:00 AM.\n\nFirst, we know that Mars can be seen until 12:10 AM. Jupiter appears 2 hours and 41 minutes after Mars disappears. Therefore, we add 2 hours and 41 minutes to 12:10 AM:\n\n\\[ 12:10 \\text{ AM} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 2:10 \\text{ AM} \\]\n\\[ 2:10 \\text{ AM} + 41 \\text{ minutes} = 2:51 \\text{ AM} \\]\n\nSo, Jupiter appears at 2:51 AM. Uranus appears 3 hours and 16 minutes after Jupiter appears. Therefore, we add 3 hours and 16 minutes to 2:51 AM:\n\n\\[ 2:51 \\text{ AM} + 3 \\text{ hours} = 5:51 \\text{ AM} \\]\n\\[ 5:51 \\text{ AM} + 16 \\text{ minutes} = 6:07 \\text{ AM} \\]\n\nSo, Uranus appears at 6:07 AM.

Jupiter appears 2 hours and 41 minutes after Mars disappears. So, we calculate the time Jupiter appears as follows:\n\\[ 12:10 \\text{ AM} + 2 \\text{ hours and } 41 \\text{ minutes} = 12:10 + 2:41 = 2:51 \\text{ AM} \\]\n\nNext, Uranus appears 3 hours and 16 minutes after Jupiter appears.
