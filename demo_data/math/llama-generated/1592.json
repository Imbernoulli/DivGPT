        "To determine how many minutes Jack spends mopping, we first need to find the total area of the floors he has to mop. The bathroom floor is 24 square feet and the kitchen floor is 80 square feet. Therefore, the total area is:\n\n\\[24 + 80 = 104 \\text{ square feet}\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate how long it takes Jack to mop this total area. Jack can mop 8 square feet per minute. To find the total time he spends mopping, we divide the total area by his mopping rate:\n\n\\[104 \\div 8 = 13 \\text{ minutes}\\]\n\nSo, Jack spends \\(\\boxed{13}\\) minutes mopping.",
