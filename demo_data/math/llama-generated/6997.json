        "Let's start by determining the initial number of newborn elephants and baby hippos. According to the problem, there are ten more newborn elephants than baby hippos. We are also given that an entire herd starts with 20 elephants and 35 hippos.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of female hippos. The problem states that the number of female hippos is \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\) of the total number of hippos:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of female hippos} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times 35 = 25\n\\]\n\nEach female hippo gives birth to 5 new baby hippos. Therefore, the total number of new baby hippos is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total new baby hippos} = 25 \\times 5 = 125\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of newborn elephants. We know there are ten more newborn elephants than baby hippos:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of newborn elephants} = 125 + 10 = 135\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of elephants and hippos after the births. The initial number of elephants is 20, and the number of newborn elephants is 135. Therefore, the total number of elephants is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total elephants} = 20 + 135 = 155\n\\]\n\nThe initial number of hippos is 35, and the number of new baby hippos is 125. Therefore, the total number of hippos is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total hippos} = 35 + 125 = 160\n\\]\n\nFinally, the total number of animals in the herd is the sum of the total number of elephants and the total number of hippos:\n\\[\n\\text{Total animals} = 155 + 160 = 315\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of animals that are there altogether is \\(\\boxed{315}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of animals in the herd after the birth of new baby hippos and newborn elephants, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of female hippos:**\n   The total number of hippos is 35.
