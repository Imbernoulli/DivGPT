Therefore, we multiply the number of eggs Benjamin collects by 3:\n\\[ 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\]\nSo, Carla collects 18 dozen eggs a day.\n\nNow, let's determine how many eggs Trisha collects. Trisha collects 4 dozen eggs less than Benjamin. Therefore, we subtract 4 from the number of eggs Benjamin collects:\n\\[ 6 - 4 = 2 \\]\nSo, Trisha collects 2 dozen eggs a day.\n\nTo find the total number of dozen eggs collected by Benjamin, Carla, and Trisha, we add the number of eggs each person collects:\n\\[ 6 + 18 + 2 = 26 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of dozen eggs collected by the three is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).",
