        "To determine the number of purple cars Jason counted, we start by defining variables for the number of each type of car. Let \\( p \\) represent the number of purple cars. According to the problem, Jason counted 6 more red cars than purple cars, so the number of red cars is \\( p + 6 \\). Additionally, he counted four times as many green cars as red cars, so the number of green cars is \\( 4(p + 6) \\).\n\nThe total number of cars counted is the sum of the purple, red, and green cars. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\np + (p + 6) + 4(p + 6) = 312\n\\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the left side of the equation by combining like terms:\n\\[\np + p + 6 + 4p + 24 = 312\n\\]\n\\[\n6p + 30 = 312\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate the term with the variable \\( p \\) by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n6p = 282\n\\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( p \\) by dividing both sides by 6:\n\\[\np = 47\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of purple cars Jason counted is \\(\\boxed{47}\\).",

According to the problem, the number of red cars is 6 more than the number of purple cars, so we can express the number of red cars as \\( p + 6 \\). Additionally, the number of green cars is four times the number of red cars, so we can express the number of green cars as \\( 4(p + 6) \\).\n\nThe total number of cars Jason counted is the sum of the purple, red, and green cars. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\np + (p + 6) + 4(p + 6) = 312\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's simplify the left side of the equation by distributing and combining like terms:\n\\[\np + p + 6 + 4p + 24 = 312\n\\]\n\\[\n6p + 30 = 312\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate the term with \\( p \\) by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n6p = 282\n\\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( p \\) by dividing both sides by 6:\n\\[\np = 47\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of purple cars is \\(\\boxed{47}\\).",
        "Let's define the number of purple cars as \\( p \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of red cars is 6 more than the number of purple cars. Therefore, the number of red cars can be expressed as:\n\\[\nr = p + 6\n\\]\n\nNext, the problem states that Jason counted four times as many green cars as red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars can be expressed as:\n\\[\ng = 4r\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\( r \\) into the equation for \\( g \\), we get:\n\\[\ng = 4(p + 6)\n\\]\n\nExpanding this, we find:\n\\[\ng = 4p + 24\n\\]\n\nThe total number of cars Jason counted is 312.
