        "To determine how many hits per game Javier needs to average in his remaining games to bring his season average up to 3 hits per game, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of games Javier plays in the season:**\n   Javier plays 2 games a week. In the first 20 games, he plays:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20 \\text{ games}}{2 \\text{ games/week}} = 10 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n   He has 10 games left. Therefore, the total number of games in the season is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ games} + 10 \\text{ games} = 30 \\text{ games}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of hits Javier has in the first 20 games:**\n   Javier averaged 2 hits per game in his first 20 games. Therefore, the total number of hits is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ games} \\times 2 \\text{ hits/game} = 40 \\text{ hits}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total number of hits Javier needs for the entire season to average 3 hits per game:**\n   To average 3 hits per game over 30 games, the total number of hits needed is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ games} \\times 3 \\text{ hits/game} = 90 \\text{ hits}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of hits Javier needs in his remaining 10 games:**\n   Javier already has 40 hits in his first 20 games. Therefore, the number of hits he needs in his remaining 10 games is:\n   \\[\n   90 \\text{ hits} - 40 \\text{ hits} = 50 \\text{ hits}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the average number of hits per game Javier needs in his remaining games:**\n   Javier needs to achieve 50 hits in 10 games. Therefore, the average number of hits per game is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50 \\text{ hits}}{10 \\text{ games}} = 5 \\text{ hits/game}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Javier needs to average \\(\\boxed{5}\\) hits per game to bring his average for the season up to 3 hits per game.",

Calculate the average number of hits per game Javier needs in his remaining games.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hits Javier has so far.**\n\nJavier plays 2 games a week and has played 20 games. So, the total number of games he has played is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ games} \\]\n\nIn each of his first 20 games, he averaged 2 hits. Therefore, the total number of hits he has so far is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ games} \\times 2 \\text{ hits/game} = 40 \\text{ hits} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of hits Javier needs for the entire season.**\n\nJavier has 10 games left, so the total number of games he will play in the season is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ games} + 10 \\text{ games} = 30 \\text{ games} \\]\n\nTo have an average of 3 hits per game for the entire season, the total number of hits he needs is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ games} \\times 3 \\text{ hits/game} = 90 \\text{ hits} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many more hits Javier needs in his remaining games.**\n\nJavier has already produced 40 hits, so the number of additional hits he needs is:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ hits} - 40 \\text{ hits} = 50 \\text{ hits} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the average number of hits per game Javier needs in his remaining games.**\n\nJavier has 10 games left, so the average number of hits per game he needs is:\n\\[ \\frac{50 \\text{ hits}}{10 \\text{ games}} = 5 \\text{ hits/game} \\]\n\nTherefore, Javier needs to average \\(\\boxed{5}\\) hits per game to bring his average for the season up to 3 hits per game.",
        "To determine how many hits per game Javier needs to average in his remaining games to bring his average for the season up to 3 hits per game, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.
