        "To determine the new area of the bathroom after extending it by 2 feet on each side, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the original length of the bathroom:**\n   - We know the area of the bathroom is 96 square feet.\n   - The width of the bathroom is 8 feet.\n   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the known values:\n     \\[\n     96 = \\text{Length} \\times 8\n     \\]\n   - Solving for the length:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Length} = \\frac{96}{8} = 12 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the new dimensions of the bathroom:**\n   - The owner wants to extend the bathroom by 2 feet on each side.\n   - This means the width and the length will each increase by 2 feet.\n   - New width:\n     \\[\n     \\text{New Width} = 8 + 2 = 10 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n   - New length:\n     \\[\n     \\text{New Length} = 12 + 2 = 14 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the new area of the bathroom:**\n   - The new area is given by the product of the new length and the new width:\n     \\[\n     \\text{New Area} = \\text{New Length} \\times \\text{New Width}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the new dimensions:\n     \\[\n     \\text{New Area} = 14 \\times 10 = 140 \\text{ square feet}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the new area of the bathroom is \\(\\boxed{140}\\) square feet.",
        "To determine the new area of the bathroom after extending it by 2 feet on each side, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the original length of the bathroom:**\n   The area of the bathroom is given as 96 square feet, and the width is 8 feet.
