        "To determine the speed the man would have to drive over the next 2 hours to achieve an average speed of 70 mph, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance the man would travel if he drove at an average speed of 70 mph for 5 hours.\n2. Calculate the distance the man has already traveled in the first 3 hours.\n3.

The total distance for 5 hours at an average speed of 70 mph is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance} = 70 \\text{ mph} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 350 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. The distance the man has already traveled in the first 3 hours at 60 mph is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance already traveled} = 60 \\text{ mph} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 180 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. The remaining distance he needs to travel in the next 2 hours is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining distance} = 350 \\text{ miles} - 180 \\text{ miles} = 170 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n4. The speed required to travel the remaining 170 miles in the next 2 hours is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Required speed} = \\frac{170 \\text{ miles}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 85 \\text{ mph}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the man would have to drive \\boxed{85} mph over the next 2 hours to get an average speed of 70 mph.",
