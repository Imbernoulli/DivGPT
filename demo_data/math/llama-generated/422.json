        "To determine the number of orange marbles in the jar, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of blue marbles.\n2. Determine the total number of red and blue marbles.\n3. Subtract the total number of red and blue marbles from the total number of marbles to find the number of orange marbles.\n\nFirst, we know that half of the 24 marbles are blue. Therefore, we calculate the number of blue marbles as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue marbles} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we know there are 6 red marbles. So, we add the number of blue marbles and red marbles to find the total number of red and blue marbles:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of red and blue marbles} = 12 + 6 = 18\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of red and blue marbles from the total number of marbles to find the number of orange marbles:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of orange marbles} = 24 - 18 = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of orange marbles is \\boxed{6}.",
