He sits next to the brass section where four people play trombone, two play trumpet, and one plays a French horn. In front of them are the strings section with three violinists, a cellist, and a contrabassist. Next to the strings are a trio of clarinets and a quartet of flute players in the woodwinds section. The maestro conducts them all. How many people are in the orchestra?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
