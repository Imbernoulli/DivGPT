There are 365 days in a year.\n\\[ 1 \\text{ carrot/day} \\times 365 \\text{ days/year} = 365 \\text{ carrots/year} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of bags of carrots Harris needs.**\n\nThere are 5 carrots in each bag. To find out how many bags Harris needs, we divide the total number of carrots by the number of carrots per bag.\n\\[ 365 \\text{ carrots} \\div 5 \\text{ carrots/bag} = 73 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the bags of carrots.**\n\nEach bag costs $2.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.\n\\[ 73 \\text{ bags} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/bag} = 146 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Harris will spend on carrots in one year is \\(\\boxed{146}\\).",
        "To determine how much Harris will spend on carrots in one year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of carrots Harris uses in one year:**\n   Harris feeds his dog 1 carrot per day. Therefore, in one year (which has 365 days), he will use:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ carrot/day} \\times 365 \\text{ days/year} = 365 \\text{ carrots/year}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many bags of carrots are needed:**\n   Each bag contains 5 carrots. To find out how many bags are needed for 365 carrots, we divide the total number of carrots by the number of carrots per bag:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{365 \\text{ carrots}}{5 \\text{ carrots/bag}} = 73 \\text{ bags}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the carrots:**\n   Each bag costs $2.00.
