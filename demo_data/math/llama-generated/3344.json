        "To determine how many bats Randy has, we start by defining a variable for the unknown quantity. Let's use \\( b \\) to represent the number of bats Randy has. According to the problem, Randy has 1 more baseball glove than 7 times the number of bats he has. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of baseball gloves} = 7b + 1 \\]\n\nWe are given that Randy has 29 baseball gloves. Therefore, we can substitute 29 for the number of baseball gloves in the equation:\n\n\\[ 29 = 7b + 1 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve this equation for \\( b \\). First, we isolate the term with \\( b \\) by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 29 - 1 = 7b \\]\n\\[ 28 = 7b \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( b \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{28}{7} \\]\n\\[ b = 4 \\]\n\nSo, Randy has \\(\\boxed{4}\\) bats.",

Therefore, we can substitute 29 for the number of baseball gloves in the equation:\n\n\\[ 29 = 7b + 1 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve for \\( b \\). First, we isolate the term with \\( b \\) by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 29 - 1 = 7b \\]\n\\[ 28 = 7b \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( b \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{28}{7} \\]\n\\[ b = 4 \\]\n\nSo, the number of bats Randy has is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
