        "To determine how many pies are not eaten with forks, we start by finding out how many pies are eaten with forks. Given that 68% of all pies are eaten with forks and there are 2000 pies in total, we can calculate the number of pies eaten with forks as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of pies eaten with forks} = 68\\% \\times 2000 = \\frac{68}{100} \\times 2000 = 0.68 \\times 2000 = 1360 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pies are not eaten with forks. Since the total number of pies is 2000 and 1360 pies are eaten with forks, the number of pies not eaten with forks is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of pies not eaten with forks} = 2000 - 1360 = 640 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pies that are not eaten with forks is \\(\\boxed{640}\\).",
