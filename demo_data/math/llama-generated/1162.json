        "To determine how many valuable files Brennan was left with after deleting the unrelated files he downloaded in the second round, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.

Calculate the number of valuable files Brennan had after一定会 the second set of files.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of valuable files after the first Georg.**\n\nBrennan downloaded 800 files initially and deleted 70% of them because they were not helpful. Therefore, the number of files he deleted is:\n\\[ 800 \\times 0.70 = 560 \\]\nSo, the number of valuable files he had after the first Georg is:\n\\[ 800 - 560 = 240 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of valuable files after the second Georg.**\n\nBrennan then downloaded 400 more files, but realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant. Therefore, the number of irrelevant files he downloaded is:\n\\[ 400 \\times \\frac{3}{5} = 240 \\]\nSo, the number of valuable files he downloaded in the second round is:\n\\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \\]\nAdding these to the valuable files he had after the first Georg, the total number of valuable files he was left with is:\n\\[ 240 + 160 = 400 \\]\n\nThus, the number of valuable files Brennan was left with after deleting the unrelated files he downloaded in the second round is:\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]",

Add the number of valuable files from both rounds.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of files Brennan prevent after deleting 70% of the first 800 files.**\n\nBrennan downloaded 800 files and deleted 70% of them. Therefore, the number of files he deleted is:\n\\[ 800 \\times 0.70 = 560 \\]\n\nThe number of valuable files left after deleting 560 files is:\n\\[ 800 - 560 = 240 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of files Brennan prevent after deleting 3/5 of the next 400 files.**\n\nBrennan downloaded 400 more files and deleted 3/5 of them. Therefore, the number of files he deleted is:\n\\[ 400 \\times \\frac{3}{5} = 240 \\]\n\nThe number of valuable files left after deleting 240 files is:\n\\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the number of valuable files from both rounds.**\n\nThe total number of valuable files Brennan was left with is:\n\\[ 240 + 160 = 400 \\]\n\nThus, the number of valuable files Brennan was left with after deleting the unrelated files he downloaded in the second round is:\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]",

Calculate the number of files Brennan had after deleting 3/5 of the additional 400 files.\n3. Add the remaining files from the first and second rounds to get the total number of valuable files.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of files Brennan had after deleting 70% of the first 800 files. Since he deleted 70%, he保留了 30% of the files:\n\\[ 800 \\times (1 - 0.70) = 800 \\times 0.30 = 240 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of files Brennan had after deleting 3/5 of the additional 400 files. Since he deleted 3/5, he保留ed 2/5 of the files:\n\\[ 400 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{5}\\right) = 400 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 160 \\]\n\nNow, we add the remaining files from the first and second rounds to get the total number of valuable files:\n\\[ 240 + 160 = 400 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of valuable files Brennan was left with is \\(\\boxed{400}\\).",
