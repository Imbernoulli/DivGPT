        "To determine how many more points Layla scored than Nahima, we start by noting the total points scored in the game and the points Layla scored.\n\nThe total points scored by both players is 112. Layla scored 70 points. Let's denote the number of points Nahima scored as \\( N \\). According to the problem, the sum of Layla's points and Nahima's points is equal to the total points scored:\n\n\\[ 70 + N = 112 \\]\n\nTo find \\( N \\), we subtract 70 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ N = 112 - 70 \\]\n\\[ N = 42 \\]\n\nSo, Nahima scored 42 points. To find out how many more points Layla scored than Nahima, we subtract Nahima's points from Layla's points:\n\n\\[ 70 - 42 = 28 \\]\n\nTherefore, Layla scored \\(\\boxed{28}\\) more points than Nahima.",

We know the total number of points scored in the game was 112, and Layla scored 70 points. Therefore, we can calculate Nahima's points by subtracting Layla's points from the total points:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Nahima's points} = 112 - 70 = 42\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more points Layla scored than Nahima. We do this by subtracting Nahima's points from Layla's points:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in points} = 70 - 42 = 28\n\\]\n\nThus, Layla scored \\(\\boxed{28}\\) more points than Nahima.",
        "To determine how many more points Layla scored than Nahima, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total points scored in the game, which is 112.\n2. Identify the points Layla scored, which is 70.\n3. Calculate the points Nahima scored by subtracting Layla's points from the total points.\n4. Find the difference between Layla's points and Nahima's points.\n\nLet's start with step 3. The points Nahima scored can be calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Nahima's points} = \\text{Total points} - \\text{Layla's points} = 112 - 70 = 42\n\\]\n\nNow, let's move to step 4. The difference between Layla's points and Nahima's points is:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Layla's points} - \\text{Nahima's points} = 70 - 42 = 28\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Layla scored \\(\\boxed{28}\\) more points than Nahima.",
        "To determine how many more points Layla scored than Nahima, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total points scored by both players.\n2. Determine the points scored by Nahima.\n3. Calculate the difference in points between Layla and Nahima.\n\nFirst, we know the total number of points scored by both players is 112. Layla scored 70 points. Let's denote the points scored by Nahima as \\( N \\). According to the problem, the sum of Layla's points and Nahima's points is equal to the total points scored:\n\n\\[ 70 + N = 112 \\]\n\nTo find \\( N \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 70 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ N = 112 - 70 \\]\n\\[ N = 42 \\]\n\nSo, Nahima scored 42 points. Now, we need to find out how many more points Layla scored than Nahima. We do this by subtracting Nahima's points from Layla's points:\n\n\\[ 70 - 42 = 28 \\]\n\nTherefore, Layla scored \\(\\boxed{28}\\) more points than Nahima.",
