        "To determine the number of animals in the Rain Forest exhibit, we start by defining a variable for the unknown quantity. Let's denote the number of animals in the Rain Forest exhibit as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the Reptile House has 5 fewer animals than 3 times the number of animals in the Rain Forest exhibit. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\\[ 16 = 3x - 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve this equation for \\( x \\). First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( x \\) on one side:\n\\[ 16 + 5 = 3x \\]\n\\[ 21 = 3x \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{21}{3} \\]\n\\[ x = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of animals in the Rain Forest exhibit is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
