According to the problem, the number of males attending the meeting is twice the number of females, so we can express the number of males attending the meeting as \\( 2F \\).\n\nThe total number of people attending the meeting is the sum of the number of males and the number of females, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\nF + 2F = 150\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[\n3F = 150\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( F \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[\nF = \\frac{150}{3} = 50\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of females going to the meeting is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
