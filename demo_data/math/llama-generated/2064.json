        "To determine the total number of stickers Elizabeth uses on her water bottles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of water bottles Elizabeth has left after losing and having some stolen.\n2. Determine the total number of stickers used by multiplying the number of remaining water bottles by the number of stickers per bottle.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many water bottles Elizabeth has left. She starts with 10 water bottles and loses 2 at school:\n\\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \\]\nNext, someone steals 1 water bottle at dance practice:\n\\[ 8 - 1 = 7 \\]\nSo, Elizabeth has 7 water bottles left.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of stickers she uses.
