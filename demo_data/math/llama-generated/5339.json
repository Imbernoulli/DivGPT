        "To determine the total number of red colored pencils Johnny bought, we need to consider both the standard packs and the packs with extra red pencils.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of standard packs:**\n   Johnny bought 15 packs in total, and 3 of these packs have extra red pencils. Therefore, the number of standard packs is:\n   \\[\n   15 - 3 = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of red pencils in the standard packs:**\n   Each standard pack contains 1 red pencil. Since there are 12 standard packs, the total number of red pencils in the standard packs is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 1 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of red pencils in the packs with extra red pencils:**\n   Each pack with extra red pencils contains 1 red pencil plus 2 extra red pencils, which totals to 3 red pencils. Since there are 3 packs with extra red pencils, the total number of red pencils in these packs is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of red pencils:**\n   To find the total number of red pencils Johnny bought, we add the number of red pencils in the standard packs to the number of red pencils in the packs with extra red pencils:\n   \\[\n   12 + 9 = 21\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of red colored pencils Johnny bought is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of red colored pencils Johnny bought, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of red pencils in the standard packs:**\n   - Johnny buys 15 packs of colored pencils.\n   - Each pack contains 1 red pencil.\n   - Therefore, the total number of red pencils in the standard packs is:\n     \\[\n     15 \\text{ packs} \\times 1 \\text{ red pencil per pack} = 15 \\text{ red pencils}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of extra red pencils in the special packs:**\n   - Johnny notices that 3 packs have 2 extra red pencils each.\n   - Therefore, the total number of extra red pencils in these special packs is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ packs} \\times 2 \\text{ extra red pencils per pack} = 6 \\text{ extra red pencils}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of red pencils:**\n   - Add the number of red pencils from the standard packs to the number of extra red pencils from the special packs:\n     \\[\n     15 \\text{ red pencils} + 6 \\text{ extra red pencils} = 21 \\text{ red pencils}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of red colored pencils Johnny bought is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",

Calculate the number of red pencils in the packs with extra red pencils:\n   - Each of the 3 packs with extra red pencils contains 1 red pencil plus 2 extra red pencils.\n   - Therefore, each of these packs contains \\(1 + 2 = 3\\) red pencils.\n   - So, the total number of red pencils in the packs with extra red pencils is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\n3. Add the number of red pencils from the standard packs and the packs with extra red pencils to get the total number of red pencils:\n   - The total number of red pencils is \\(12 + 9 = 21\\).\n\nThus, the total number of red colored pencils Johnny bought is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
