Determine the width of the pyramid.\n3. Calculate the sum of the height and width.\n\nFirst, we know that the pyramid is 20 feet taller than 500 feet. Therefore, we can calculate the height as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Height} = 500 \\text{ feet} + 20 \\text{ feet} = 520 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that the pyramid is 234 feet wider than it is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the width as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Width} = \\text{Height} + 234 \\text{ feet} = 520 \\text{ feet} + 234 \\text{ feet} = 754 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the height and the width:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of height and width} = \\text{Height} + \\text{Width} = 520 \\text{ feet} + 754 \\text{ feet} = 1274 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the height and width of the Great Pyramid of Giza is \\(\\boxed{1274}\\).",
