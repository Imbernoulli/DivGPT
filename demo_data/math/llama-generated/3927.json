The time from 2:30 pm to 5 pm is 2 hours and 30 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 120 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 150 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time the other family members used the bathroom. The oldest daughter used the bathroom for 45 minutes, the youngest daughter used it for 30 minutes, and the husband used it for 20 minutes. Adding these times together, we get:\n\\[ 45 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} = 95 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total time the other family members used the bathroom from the total time available:\n\\[ 150 \\text{ minutes} - 95 \\text{ minutes} = 55 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Parker will have \\(\\boxed{55}\\) minutes to use the bathroom to leave on time.",

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time from 2:30 pm to 3:30 pm is 1 hour (60 minutes), and the time from 3:30 pm to 5 pm is another 1.5 hours (90 minutes).
