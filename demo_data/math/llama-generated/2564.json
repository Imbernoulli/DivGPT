A pencil with an eraser, which costs $0.8 each, a regular pencil for $0.5 each, and a short pencil for $0.4 each. This store was able to sell 200 pencils with an eraser, 40 regular pencils, and 35 short pencils. How much money did the store make from these sales?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total revenue generated from the sales of pencils, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of pencil separately and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. Calculate the revenue from pencils with an eraser:\n   - The cost of one pencil with an eraser is $0.8.\n   - The store sold 200 pencils with an eraser.\n   - Revenue from pencils with an eraser = \\( 200 \\times 0.8 = 160 \\) dollars.\n\n2.

Calculate the revenue from short pencils:\n   - The cost of one short pencil is $0.4.\n   - The store sold 35 short pencils.\n   - Revenue from short pencils = \\( 35 \\times 0.4 = 14 \\) dollars.\n\n4. Sum the revenues from all types of pencils to find the total revenue:\n   - Total revenue = Revenue from pencils with an eraser + Revenue from regular pencils + Revenue from short pencils\n   - Total revenue = \\( 160 + 20 + 14 = 194 \\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the store made from these sales is \\(\\boxed{194}\\).",

Calculate the revenue from the regular pencils:\n   - The cost of each regular pencil is $0.5.\n   - The store sold 40 regular pencils.\n   - Therefore, the revenue from regular pencils is:\n     \\[\n     40 \\times 0.5 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. Calculate the revenue from the short pencils:\n   - The cost of each short pencil is $0.4.\n   - The store sold 35 short pencils.\n   - Therefore, the revenue from short pencils is:\n     \\[\n     35 \\times 0.4 = 14 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. Sum the revenues from all types of pencils to find the total revenue:\n   \\[\n   160 + 20 + 14 = 194 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money the store made from these sales is \\(\\boxed{194}\\)."
