        "To determine the total number of minutes Daniel practices basketball in a whole week, we need to break down his practice schedule into two parts: the school week and the weekend.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total practice time during the school week. Daniel practices for 15 minutes each day, and there are 5 school days in a week. Therefore, we multiply the daily practice time by the number of school days:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 75 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total practice time during the weekend. Daniel practices twice as long each day on the weekend compared to the school week. Since he practices for 15 minutes each school day, he practices for \\( 15 \\times 2 = 30 \\) minutes each day on the weekend. There are 2 days in the weekend, so we multiply the daily practice time on the weekend by the number of weekend days:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 60 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we add the total practice time during the school week and the weekend to find the total practice time for the whole week:\n\\[ 75 \\text{ minutes} + 60 \\text{ minutes} = 135 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of minutes Daniel practices during a whole week is \\(\\boxed{135}\\).",
