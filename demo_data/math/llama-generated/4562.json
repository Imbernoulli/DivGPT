        "To determine how many hours Beth will need to finish reading the remaining chapters, we first need to calculate her reading rate and then use that rate to find out how long it will take her to read the remaining chapters.\n\n1. **Calculate Beth's reading rate:**\n   Beth reads 2 chapters in 3 hours.
