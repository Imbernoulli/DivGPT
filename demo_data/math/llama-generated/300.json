        "To determine how many nuts Bill and Harry have combined, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many nuts Harry has.\n2. Use the number of nuts Harry has to find out how many nuts Bill has.\n3. Add the number of nuts Harry has to the number of nuts Bill has.\n\nFirst, we know that Sue has 48 nuts. Since Harry has twice as many nuts as Sue, we calculate the number of nuts Harry has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of nuts Harry has} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of nuts Sue has} = 2 \\times 48 = 96\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Bill has 6 times as many nuts as Harry. Therefore, we calculate the number of nuts Bill has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of nuts Bill has} = 6 \\times \\text{Number of nuts Harry has} = 6 \\times 96 = 576\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of nuts Harry has to the number of nuts Bill has to find out how many nuts they have combined:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of nuts Bill and Harry have combined} = \\text{Number of nuts Bill has} + \\text{Number of nuts Harry has} = 576 + 96 = 672\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of nuts Bill and Harry have combined is \\boxed{672}.",
