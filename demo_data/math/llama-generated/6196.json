        "To determine how many more fish the fisherman caught than the pelican, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of fish the kingfisher caught.\n2. find the total number of fish the pelican and kingfisher caught together.\n3. Calculate the number of fish the fisherman caught.\n4. Determine how many more fish the fisherman caught than the pelican.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The kingfisher caught 7 more fish than the pelican. Since the pelican caught 13 fish, the kingfisher caught:\n   \\[\n   13 + 7 = 20 \\text{ fish}\n   \\]\n\n2. The total number of fish the pelican and kingfisher caught together is:\n   \\[\n   13 + 20 = 33 \\text{ fish}\n   \\]\n\n3. The fisherman caught 3 times the total amount of fish the pelican and kingfisher caught. Therefore, the fisherman caught:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 33 = 99 \\text{ fish}\n   \\]\n\n4. To find out how many more fish the fisherman caught than the pelican, we subtract the number of fish the pelican caught from the number of fish the fisherman caught:\n   \\[\n   99 - 13 = 86\n   \\]\n\nSo, the fisherman caught \\(\\boxed{86}\\) more fish than the pelican.",

Calculate the difference between the number of fish the fisherman caught and the number of fish the pelican caught.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The kingfisher caught 7 more fish than the pelican. Since the pelican caught 13 fish, we can calculate the number of fish the kingfisher caught as follows:\n\\[\n7 + 13 = 20\n\\]\nSo, the kingfisher caught 20 fish.\n\nNext, we find the total number of fish caught by the pelican and the kingfisher by adding the number of fish each caught:\n\\[\n13 + 20 = 33\n\\]\nSo, the pelican and the kingfisher together caught 33 fish.\n\nNow, we determine the number of fish the fisherman caught. The fisherman caught 3 times the total amount of fish the pelican and kingfisher caught:\n\\[\n3 \\times 33 = 99\n\\]\nSo, the fisherman caught 99 fish.\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the number of fish the fisherman caught and the number of fish the pelican caught:\n\\[\n99 - 13 = 86\n\\]\nSo, the fisherman caught 86 more fish than the pelican.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{86}\n\\]",

Find the difference between the number of fish the fisherman caught and the number of fish the pelican caught.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The kingfisher caught 7 more fish than the pelican. Since the pelican caught 13 fish, we can calculate the number of fish the kingfisher caught as follows:\n   \\[\n   13 + 7 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the kingfisher caught 20 fish.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the total number of fish caught by the pelican and the kingfisher. We add the number of fish the pelican caught to the number of fish the kingfisher caught:\n   \\[\n   13 + 20 = 33\n   \\]\n   So, the pelican and the kingfisher together caught 33 fish.\n\n3. The fisherman caught 3 times the total number of fish the pelican and the kingfisher caught. Therefore, we multiply the total number of fish caught by the pelican and the kingfisher by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 33 = 99\n   \\]\n   So, the fisherman caught 99 fish.\n\n4. Finally, we need to find out how many more fish the fisherman caught than the pelican. We subtract the number of fish the pelican caught from the number of fish the fisherman caught:\n   \\[\n   99 - 13 = 86\n   \\]\n   So, the fisherman caught 86 more fish than the pelican.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{86}\n\\]",
