        "Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Wilson withdrew last month.\n\n1. **Initial Amount Two Months Ago:**\n   Wilson started with $150 in his bank account two months ago.\n\n2. **Deposit Last Month:**\n   Last month, Wilson deposited $17 into his account.\n\n3. **Withdrawal Last Month:**\n   Let's denote the amount Wilson withdrew last month as \\( W \\).\n\n4. **Deposit This Month:**\n   This month, Wilson deposited $21 into his account.\n\n5. **Final Amount This Month:**\n   After all these transactions, Wilson has $16 more than what he had two months ago. Therefore, his final amount this month is:\n   \\[\n   150 + 16 = 166 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   We can set up an equation to represent the transactions over the past two months starting from the initial amount:\n   \\[\n   150 + 17 - W + 21 = 166\n   \\]\n\n7. **Simplifying the Equation:**\n   Combine the constant terms on the left side:\n   \\[\n   150 + 38 - W = 166\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   188 - W = 166\n   \\]\n\n8. **Solving for \\( W \\):**\n   Subtract 166 from both sides to isolate \\( W \\):\n   \\[\n   188 - 166 = W\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   W = 22\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Wilson withdrew \\(\\boxed{22}\\) dollars last month.",

        "Let's start by determining how much money Wilson had after his deposits and withdrawals over the past two months.\n\nTwo months ago, Wilson had $150 in his bank account. Last month, he deposited $17, so his balance before the withdrawal was:\n\\[ 150 + 17 = 167 \\]\n\nLet's denote the amount Wilson withdrew last month by \\( W \\). After the withdrawal, his balance was:\n\\[ 167 - W \\]\n\nThis month, Wilson deposited $21, so his current balance is:\n\\[ (167 - W) + 21 = 188 - W \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Wilson's current balance is $16 more than what he had two months ago. Two months ago, he had $150, so his current balance is:\n\\[ 150 + 16 = 166 \\]\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\\[ 188 - W = 166 \\]\n\nTo find \\( W \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ 188 - W = 166 \\]\n\\[ 188 - 166 = W \\]\n\\[ W = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, Wilson withdrew \\(\\boxed{22}\\) dollars last month."
