        "To determine the total number of steps Jeffrey takes to go from the house to the mailbox, we need to analyze his pattern of walking. Jeffrey takes 3 steps forward and then 2 steps backward, which results in a net movement of \\(3 - 2 = 1\\) step forward.\n\nThe distance between the house and the mailbox is 66 steps. Since Jeffrey's net movement is 1 step forward for every 5 steps he takes (3 forward and 2 backward), we need to find out how many cycles of 5 steps are required to cover 66 steps.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cycles} = \\frac{66}{1} = 66\n\\]\n\nEach cycle consists of 5 steps, so the total number of steps Jeffrey takes is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total steps} = 66 \\times 5 = 330\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of steps Jeffrey takes to go from the house to the mailbox is \\(\\boxed{330}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of steps Jeffrey takes to go from the house to the mailbox, we need to consider his unique walking pattern: for every three steps forward, he takes two steps backwards. This results in a net movement of one step forward for every five steps he takes.\n\nGiven that the distance between the house and the mailbox is 66 steps, we need to find out how many sets of five steps (which result in a net movement of one step forward) are required to cover 66 steps. We do this by dividing 66 by 1:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of sets of five steps} = \\frac{66}{1} = 66\n\\]\n\nSince each set of five steps requires Jeffrey to take 5 steps, the total number of steps he takes is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of steps} = 66 \\times 5 = 330\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of steps Jeffrey takes when he goes from the house to the mailbox is \\(\\boxed{330}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of steps Jeffrey takes to go from the house to the mailbox, we need to analyze his walking pattern.

        "To determine the total number of steps Jeffrey takes to go from the house to the mailbox, we need to analyze his walking pattern and how it affects his progress.\n\nJeffrey's walking pattern is such that for every three steps forward, he takes two steps backward. This means that for every 5 steps he takes (3 forward and 2 backward), he effectively moves 1 step forward.\n\nWe need to find out how many such cycles of 5 steps are required to cover the 66 steps to the mailbox. To do this, we divide the total distance by the net distance covered in each cycle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cycles} = \\frac{66 \\text{ steps}}{1 \\text{ step per cycle}} = 66 \\text{ cycles}\n\\]\n\nSince each cycle consists of 5 steps, the total number of steps Jeffrey takes is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total steps} = 66 \\text{ cycles} \\times 5 \\text{ steps per cycle} = 330 \\text{ steps}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of steps Jeffrey takes when he goes from the house to the mailbox is \\(\\boxed{330}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of steps Jeffrey takes to go from the house to the mailbox, we need to consider his unique walking pattern: for every three steps forward, he takes two steps backward.

Since each cycle results in a net movement of 1 step forward, he needs \\(66\\) cycles to cover 66 steps.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of steps Jeffrey takes in these 66 cycles. Since each cycle consists of 5 steps, the total number of steps is:\n\\[\n66 \\times 5 = 330\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of steps Jeffrey takes when he goes from the house to the mailbox is \\(\\boxed{330}\\).",
