        "To determine Jessica's current age, let's first find out her mother's age at the time of her death. According to the problem, if her mother were alive now, ten years later, she would have been 70 years old. Therefore, her mother's age at the time of her death was:\n\n\\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Jessica was half her mother's age when her mother died. So, Jessica's age at that time was:\n\n\\[ \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\]\n\nSince Jessica's mother died ten years ago, Jessica has aged ten years since then. Therefore, Jessica's current age is:\n\n\\[ 30 + 10 = 40 \\]\n\nThus, Jessica's current age is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{40}\n\\]",
