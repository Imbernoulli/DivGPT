He cuts his yard 15 times a month for 6 months (April, May, June, July, August, September).\n\n\\[\n15 \\text{ times/month} \\times 6 \\text{ months} = 90 \\text{ times}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of times he cuts his yard from October to March. He cuts his yard 3 times a month for 6 months (October, November, December, January, February, March).\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ times/month} \\times 6 \\text{ months} = 18 \\text{ times}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's add the two totals together to find the total number of times he cuts his yard in a year.\n\n\\[\n90 \\text{ times} + 18 \\text{ times} = 108 \\text{ times}\n\\]\n\nTo find the average number of times he cuts his yard per month, we divide the total number of times by the number of months in a year.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{108 \\text{ times}}{12 \\text{ months}} = 9 \\text{ times/month}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of times Mr. Roper cuts his yard per month is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
        "To determine the average number of times Mr. Roper cuts his lawn per month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of times he cuts his lawn from April to September.**\n   - There are 6 months from April to September.\n   - He cuts his lawn 15 times each month.\n   - Total cuts from April to September: \\( 6 \\times 15 = 90 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of times he cuts his lawn from October to March.**\n   - There are 6 months from October to March.\n   - He cuts his lawn 3 times each month.\n   - Total cuts from October to March: \\( 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of times he cuts his lawn in a year.**\n   - Total cuts from April to September: 90\n   - Total cuts from October to March: 18\n   - Total cuts in a year: \\( 90 + 18 = 108 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the average number of times he cuts his lawn per month.**\n   - There are 12 months in a year.\n   - Average cuts per month: \\( \\frac{108}{12} = 9 \\).\n\nTherefore, the average number of times Mr. Roper cuts his yard per month is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."
