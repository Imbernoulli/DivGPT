Mark took a soft drink in the afternoon that contained 2500 calories, 5% of which was from added sugar. Then he bought some bars of candy which had 25 calories of added sugar each. If he eventually exceeded the recommended intake of added sugar by 100%, how many bars of candy did he take?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many bars of candy Mark took, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of added sugar in the soft drink.\n2. Determine how much added sugar Mark consumed from the candy.\n3. Set up an equation based on the total added sugar consumption and solve for the number of candy bars.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount of added sugar in the soft drink.**\n\nThe soft drink contains 2500 calories, and 5% of these calories are from added sugar.\n\\[\n\\text{Added sugar from soft drink} = 2500 \\times 0.05 = 125 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much added sugar Mark consumed from the candy.**\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of candy bars Mark took. Each candy bar contains 25 calories of added sugar.\n\\[\n\\text{Added sugar from candy} = 25x \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Set up an equation based on the total added sugar consumption.**\n\nMark exceeded the recommended intake of added sugar by 100%. The recommended intake is 150 calories, so exceeding it by 100% means consuming:\n\\[\n150 + 150 = 300 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nThe total added sugar consumed by Mark is the sum of the added sugar from the soft drink and the added sugar from the candy:\n\\[\n125 + 25x = 300\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n25x = 300 - 125\n\\]\n\\[\n25x = 175\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{175}{25}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 7\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mark took \\(\\boxed{7}\\) bars of candy.",
        "To determine how many bars of candy Mark took, we need to calculate the total added sugar he consumed and compare it to the recommended intake.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of added sugar in the soft drink. The soft drink contains 2500 calories, and 5% of these calories come from added sugar:\n\\[\n0.05 \\times 2500 = 125 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\nSo, Mark consumed 125 calories of added sugar from the soft drink.\n\nNext, let's denote the number of candy bars Mark took as \\( x \\). Each candy bar contains 25 calories of added sugar, so the total amount of added sugar from the candy bars is:\n\\[\n25x \\text{ calories}\n\\]\nThe total amount of added sugar Mark consumed is the sum of the added sugar from the soft drink and the added sugar from the candy bars:\n\\[\n125 + 25x \\text{ calories}\n\\]\nAccording to the problem, Mark exceeded the recommended intake of added sugar by 100%. The recommended intake is 150 calories, so exceeding it by 100% means he consumed:\n\\[\n150 + 150 = 300 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\nTherefore, we can set up the following equation to find \\( x \\):\n\\[\n125 + 25x = 300\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first subtract 125 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n25x = 175\n\\]\nNext, we divide both sides by 25:\n\\[\nx = 7\n\\]\nSo, Mark took \\(\\boxed{7}\\) bars of candy."
