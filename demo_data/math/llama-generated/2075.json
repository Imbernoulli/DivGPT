        "To determine how many potatoes Johnson has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of potatoes Johnson gives to Tom.\n2. Calculate the number of potatoes Johnson gives to Anne.\n3. Subtract the total number of potatoes given away from the initial number of potatoes in the sack.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many potatoes Johnson gives to Tom. Since he gives Tom twice as many potatoes as he gave Gina, and he gave Gina 69 potatoes, we have:\n\\[ 2 \\times 69 = 138 \\text{ potatoes} \\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many potatoes Johnson gives to Anne. Since he gives Anne one-third of the amount of potatoes he gave Tom, and he gave Tom 138 potatoes, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{138}{3} = 46 \\text{ potatoes} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of potatoes Johnson gives away. He gives Gina 69 potatoes, Tom 138 potatoes, and Anne 46 potatoes, so the total is:\n\\[ 69 + 138 + 46 = 253 \\text{ potatoes} \\]\n\nFinally, let's subtract the total number of potatoes given away from the initial number of potatoes in the sack. Johnson started with 300 potatoes, so:\n\\[ 300 - 253 = 47 \\text{ potatoes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of potatoes Johnson has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{47} \\]",
