        "To determine how many weeks it took Erwin to finish 24 chocolates, we need to calculate the total number of chocolates he eats in one week and then divide the total number of chocolates by this weekly amount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of chocolates Erwin eats in one week:\n- Erwin eats 2 chocolates each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of chocolates he eats on weekdays is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 5 = 10\n  \\]\n- Erwin eats 1 chocolate each weekend day.

There are 2 weekend days in a week, so the total number of chocolates he eats on weekends is:\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ chocolate/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 2 \\text{ chocolates}\n  \\]\n- Adding the chocolates eaten on weekdays and weekends gives us the total number of chocolates he eats in one week:\n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ chocolates} + 2 \\text{ chocolates} = 12 \\text{ chocolates/week}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many weeks it took Erwin to eat 24 chocolates. We do this by dividing the total number of chocolates by the number of chocolates he eats in one week:\n\\[\n\\frac{24 \\text{ chocolates}}{12 \\text{ chocolates/week}} = 2 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it took Erwin \\boxed{2} weeks to finish all the chocolates.",
