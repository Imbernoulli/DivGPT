Determine how many of the people who showed up ordered chicken.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of people who didn't show up. John invited 30 people and 20% of them didn't show up:\n\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 30 = 6 \\]\n\nSo, 6 people didn't show up. Therefore, the number of people who did show up is:\n\n\\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many of the people who showed up ordered steak. 75% of the people who showed up got steak:\n\n\\[ 0.75 \\times 24 = 18 \\]\n\nSo, 18 people ordered steak. The rest of the people who showed up ordered chicken. To find out how many people ordered chicken, we subtract the number of people who ordered steak from the total number of people who showed up:\n\n\\[ 24 - 18 = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people who ordered chicken is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",
