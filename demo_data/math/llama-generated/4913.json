        "To determine how many bags of leaves Bob and Johnny raked on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money they earned on Monday.\n2. Calculate the total amount of money they earned on Tuesday.\n3. Add the amounts earned on Monday and Tuesday.\n4. Subtract the total amount earned on Monday and Tuesday from the total amount earned over the three days to find out how much they earned on Wednesday.\n5. Determine the number of bags of leaves they raked on Wednesday by dividing the amount earned on Wednesday by the charge per bag.\n\nLet's start with Monday:\n- They raked 5 bags of leaves.\n- They charge $4 per bag.\n- Therefore, the total amount earned on Monday is \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount earned on Tuesday:\n- They raked 3 bags of leaves.\n- They charge $4 per bag.\n- Therefore, the total amount earned on Tuesday is \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's add the amounts earned on Monday and Tuesday:\n- The total amount earned on Monday and Tuesday is \\(20 + 12 = 32\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's subtract the total amount earned on Monday and Tuesday from the total amount earned over the three days to find out how much they earned on Wednesday:\n- The total amount earned over the three days is $68.\n- The total amount earned on Monday and Tuesday is $32.\n- Therefore, the total amount earned on Wednesday is \\(68 - 32 = 36\\) dollars.\n\nFinally, let's determine the number of bags of leaves they raked on Wednesday by dividing the amount earned on Wednesday by the charge per bag:\n- They earned $36 on Wednesday.\n- They charge $4 per bag.\n- Therefore, the number of bags of leaves they raked on Wednesday is \\(\\frac{36}{4} = 9\\).\n\nSo, the number of bags of leaves they raked on Wednesday is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",

The earnings for Tuesday are:\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ bags} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars per bag} = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the total earnings for Monday and Tuesday are:\n  \\[\n  20 \\text{ dollars} + 12 \\text{ dollars} = 32 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total earnings for Monday and Tuesday from the total earnings over the three days to find out how much was earned on Wednesday:\n\\[\n68 \\text{ dollars} - 32 \\text{ dollars} = 36 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we determine the number of bags of leaves raked on Wednesday by dividing the amount earned on Wednesday by the charge per bag:\n\\[\n36 \\text{ dollars} \\div 4 \\text{ dollars per bag} = 9 \\text{ bags}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of bags of leaves raked on Wednesday is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",

Determine how many bags of leaves they raked on Wednesday based on their earnings for Wednesday.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of bags of leaves raked on Monday and Tuesday:\n- On Monday, they raked 5 bags.\n- On Tuesday, they raked 3 bags.\n- Therefore, the total number of bags raked on Monday and Tuesday is \\(5 + 3 = 8\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of money they earned on Monday and Tuesday:\n- They charge $4 for each bag of leaves.\n- So, the total earnings for Monday and Tuesday is \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\) dollars.\n\nWe know that their total earnings for all three days is $68. Therefore, the amount of money they earned on Wednesday is:\n\\[68 - 32 = 36\\] dollars.\n\nSince they charge $4 for each bag of leaves, the number of bags they raked on Wednesday is:\n\\[36 \\div 4 = 9\\] bags.\n\nThus, the number of bags of leaves they raked on Wednesday is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",

Determine how many bags of leaves they raked on Wednesday by dividing the amount earned on Wednesday by the charge per bag.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money they earned on Monday and Tuesday:\n- On Monday, they raked 5 bags of leaves. Since they charge $4 per bag, they earned \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) dollars on Monday.\n- On Tuesday, they raked 3 bags of leaves. Since they charge $4 per bag, they earned \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) dollars on Tuesday.\n- Therefore, the total amount of money they earned on Monday and Tuesday is \\(20 + 12 = 32\\) dollars.\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount earned on Monday and Tuesday from the total amount earned for all three days to find out how much they earned on Wednesday:\n- They earned a total of $68 for all three days.

        "To determine how many bags of leaves Bob and Johnny raked on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money they earned on Monday.\n2. Calculate the total amount of money they earned on Tuesday.\n3. Subtract the total earnings from Monday and Tuesday from the total earnings for all three days to find the earnings for Wednesday.\n4. Divide the earnings for Wednesday by the charge per bag to find the number of bags raked on Wednesday.\n\nLet's start with Monday:\n- They raked 5 bags of leaves.\n- Each bag costs $4.\n- Total earnings for Monday: \\( 5 \\text{ bags} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars/bag} = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\nNext, let's calculate Tuesday's earnings:\n- They raked 3 bags of leaves.\n- Each bag costs $4.\n- Total earnings for Tuesday: \\( 3 \\text{ bags} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars/bag} = 12 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\nNow, let's find the total earnings for Monday and Tuesday:\n- Total earnings for Monday: $20\n- Total earnings for Tuesday: $12\n- Total earnings for Monday and Tuesday: \\( 20 \\text{ dollars} + 12 \\text{ dollars} = 32 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\nWe know the total earnings for all three days is $68. To find the earnings for Wednesday, we subtract the total earnings for Monday and Tuesday from the total earnings for all three days:\n- Total earnings for all three days: $68\n- Total earnings for Monday and Tuesday: $32\n- Total earnings for Wednesday: \\( 68 \\text{ dollars} - 32 \\text{ dollars} = 36 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\nFinally, to find the number of bags raked on Wednesday, we divide the earnings for Wednesday by the charge per bag:\n- Earnings for Wednesday: $36\n- Charge per bag: $4\n- Number of bags raked on Wednesday: \\( 36 \\text{ dollars} \\div 4 \\text{ dollars/bag} = 9 \\text{ bags} \\).\n\nThus, the number of bags of leaves Bob and Johnny raked on Wednesday is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
        "To determine how many bags of leaves Bob and Johnny raked on Wednesday, we start by calculating the total number of bags they raked on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, they raked 5 bags of leaves.\nOn Tuesday, they raked 3 bags of leaves.\n\nFirst, we add the number of bags raked on Monday and Tuesday:\n\\[\n5 + 3 = 8 \\text{ bags}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know they charge $4 for each bag of leaves. Therefore, we calculate the total amount of money they earned from Monday and Tuesday by multiplying the total number of bags by the price per bag:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ bags} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars per bag} = 32 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nWe are given that the total amount of money they had after Wednesday was $68. To find out how much money they earned on Wednesday, we subtract the total amount earned from Monday and Tuesday from the total amount earned over the three days:\n\\[\n68 \\text{ dollars} - 32 \\text{ dollars} = 36 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSince they charge $4 per bag, we determine the number of bags raked on Wednesday by dividing the amount earned on Wednesday by the price per bag:\n\\[\n36 \\text{ dollars} \\div 4 \\text{ dollars per bag} = 9 \\text{ bags}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of bags of leaves they raked on Wednesday is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."
