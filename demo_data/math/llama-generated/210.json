        "To determine how many dollars Harry earns in a week, we need to calculate his earnings for each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Harry's earnings for each day:\n- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Harry walks 7 dogs each day.

Since he is paid $5 per dog, his earnings for Tuesday is:\n  \\[\n  12 \\text{ dogs} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/dog} = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\n- On Thursday, Harry walks 9 dogs. Since he is paid $5 per dog, his earnings for Thursday is:\n  \\[\n  9 \\text{ dogs} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/dog} = 45 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we sum up his earnings for all the days in the week:\n\\[\n105 \\text{ dollars} + 60 \\text{ dollars} + 45 \\text{ dollars} = 210 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Harry earns \\(\\boxed{210}\\) dollars in a week.",
