        "To determine how much money Rihanna has left after her purchases, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the mangoes.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the apple juice.\n3. Add the total costs of the mangoes and apple juice to find the total amount spent.\n4. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Rihanna had.\n\nLet's start with the cost of the mangoes:\n- Rihanna bought 6 mangoes.\n- Each mango costs $3.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the mangoes is \\(6 \\times 3 = 18\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the apple juice:\n- Rihanna bought 6 cartons of apple juice.\n- Each carton of apple juice costs $3.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the apple juice is \\(6 \\times 3 = 18\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we add the total costs of the mangoes and apple juice to find the total amount spent:\n- Total cost of mangoes = $18\n- Total cost of apple juice = $18\n- Total amount spent = $18 + $18 = $36\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Rihanna had:\n- Initial amount of money = $50\n- Total amount spent = $36\n- Amount of money left = $50 - $36 = $14\n\nThus, the amount of money Rihanna has left is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",

Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Rihanna had.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of one mango is $3, and Rihanna bought 6 mangoes.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of mangoes} = 6 \\times 3 = 18\n   \\]\n\n2. The cost of one carton of apple juice is $3, and Rihanna bought 6 cartons.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of apple juice} = 6 \\times 3 = 18\n   \\]\n\n3.
