In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs $800 per month in rent and will cost an additional $260 per month in utilities. The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the difference in total monthly costs between the two apartments, we need to consider the rent, utilities, and driving-related costs for each apartment. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the total monthly cost for the first apartment:\n1. Rent: $800\n2. Utilities: $260\n3. Driving cost: The man drives 31 miles per day and 20 days per month, so the total driving distance per month is \\(31 \\times 20 = 620\\) miles. The cost per mile is $0.58, so the total driving cost is \\(620 \\times 0.58 = 359.6\\) dollars.\n\nAdding these together gives the total monthly cost for the first apartment:\n\\[800 + 260 + 359.6 = 1419.6\\] dollars.\n\nNext, calculate the total monthly cost for the second apartment:\n1. Rent: $900\n2. Utilities: $200\n3. Driving cost: The man drives 21 miles per day and 20 days per month, so the total driving distance per month is \\(21 \\times 20 = 420\\) miles. The cost per mile is $0.58, so the total driving cost is \\(420 \\times 0.58 = 243.6\\) dollars.\n\nAdding these together gives the total monthly cost for the second apartment:\n\\[900 + 200 + 243.6 = 1343.6\\] dollars.\n\nNow, find the difference between the total monthly costs of the two apartments:\n\\[1419.6 - 1343.6 = 76\\] dollars.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments, to the nearest whole dollar, is \\(\\boxed{76}\\).",

The rent is $900.\n2. The utilities are $200.\n3. The driving distance is 21 miles per day, and the man drives to work 20 days each month. Therefore, the total driving distance in a month is \\(21 \\times 20 = 420\\) miles.\n4. The cost per mile is $0.58, so the total driving-related cost is \\(420 \\times 0.58 = 243.6\\) dollars.\n5. Adding these together, the total monthly cost for the second apartment is \\(900 + 200 + 243.6 = 1343.6\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the total monthly costs of the two apartments:\n\\[1419.6 - 1343.6 = 76\\]\n\nTherefore, the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments is \\(\\boxed{76}\\) dollars.",
