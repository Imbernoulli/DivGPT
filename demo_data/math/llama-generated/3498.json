To find the consumption per mile, we divide the total consumption by the distance:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8 \\text{ liters}}{40 \\text{ miles}} = 0.2 \\text{ liters per mile}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total fuel required for the round trip:**\n   Using the fuel consumption per mile, we multiply it by the total distance:\n   \\[\n   560 \\text{ miles} \\times 0.2 \\text{ liters per mile} = 112 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of refills needed:**\n   The motorcycle can store 8 liters of gasoline. To find out how many times Keanu needs to refill, we divide the total fuel required by the fuel capacity of the motorcycle:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{112 \\text{ liters}}{8 \\text{ liters per refill}} = 14 \\text{ refills}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Keanu has to refill his motorcycle \\boxed{14} times for the round trip.",
