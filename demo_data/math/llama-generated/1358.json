        "To determine how much money Andy makes for each cake, we need to calculate both the total costs and the total revenue for making and selling two cakes, and then find out how much profit he makes per cake.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of making two cakes. The cost of ingredients for two cakes is $12, and the cost of packaging for each cake is $1. Therefore, the total cost of packaging for two cakes is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ dollar/cake} \\times 2 \\text{ cakes} = 2 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the cost of ingredients and the cost of packaging gives us the total cost for two cakes:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ dollars} + 2 \\text{ dollars} = 14 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from selling two cakes. Andy sells each cake for $15, so the total revenue for two cakes is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ dollars/cake} \\times 2 \\text{ cakes} = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we can find the profit for two cakes by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ dollars} - 14 \\text{ dollars} = 16 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince this profit is for two cakes, we need to find out how much profit Andy makes for each cake by dividing the total profit by 2:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ dollars} \\div 2 = 8 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Andy makes for each cake is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",
