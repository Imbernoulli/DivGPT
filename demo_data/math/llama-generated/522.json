        "To determine the total number of geckos Brandon sold in the last two years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of geckos sold last year.\n2. Calculate the number of geckos sold the year before.\n3. Add the number of geckos sold last year to the number of geckos sold the year before.\n\nFirst, we know from the problem statement that Brandon sold 86 geckos last year. \n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of geckos sold the year before. According to the problem, he sold twice as many geckos the year before as he did last year. Therefore, we multiply the number of geckos sold last year by 2:\n\\[ 86 \\times 2 = 172 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of geckos sold last year to the number of geckos sold the year before:\n\\[ 86 + 172 = 258 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of geckos Brandon sold in the last two years is \\(\\boxed{258}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of geckos Brandon sold in the last two years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

Add the number of geckos sold last year to the number of geckos sold the year before.\n\nFirst, we know that Brandon sold 86 geckos last year.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of geckos Brandon sold the year before. Since he sold twice as many geckos the year before as he did last year, we multiply 86 by 2:\n\\[ 86 \\times 2 = 172 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of geckos sold last year to the number of geckos sold the year before:\n\\[ 86 + 172 = 258 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of geckos Brandon sold in the last two years is \\(\\boxed{258}\\).",
