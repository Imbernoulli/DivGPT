        "To determine the total number of hours Thomas spends on training, we need to calculate the hours he trained over the first 30 days and then add the hours he will train over the next 12 days.\n\nFirst, we calculate the hours he trained over the first 30 days. Since he trained for 5 hours each day, we multiply 5 hours by 30 days:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 150 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the hours he will train over the next 12 days.
