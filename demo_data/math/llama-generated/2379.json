        "To determine how much you will save by buying 3 liters of chlorine and 5 boxes of soap at their respective discounts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discount on the chlorine.\n2. Calculate the discount on the soap.\n3. Sum the total savings.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discount on the chlorine.**\n\nThe original price of one liter of chlorine is $10. The discount is 20%, so we calculate the discount amount as follows:\n\\[ 10 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 10 \\times 0.20 = 2 \\text{ dollars per liter} \\]\n\nSince we are buying 3 liters, the total discount on the chlorine is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discount on the soap.**\n\nThe original price of one box of soap is $16. The discount is 25%, so we calculate the discount amount as follows:\n\\[ 16 \\times \\frac{25}{100} = 16 \\times 0.25 = 4 \\text{ dollars per box} \\]\n\nSince we are buying 5 boxes, the total discount on the soap is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Sum the total savings.**\n\nThe total savings from buying 3 liters of chlorine and 5 boxes of soap is:\n\\[ 6 + 20 = 26 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount you will save is:\n\\[ \\boxed{26} \\]",
        "First, we need to calculate the discount on each item and then determine the total savings.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discount on chlorine.**\n- Original price of 1 liter of chlorine: $10\n- Discount on chlorine: 20%\n- Discount amount for 1 liter of chlorine: \\( 10 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 10 \\times 0.20 = 2 \\) dollars\n- Discounted price for 1 liter of chlorine: \\( 10 - 2 = 8 \\) dollars\n- Discounted price for 3 liters of chlorine: \\( 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\) dollars\n- Original price for 3 liters of chlorine: \\( 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\) dollars\n- Savings on chlorine: \\( 30 - 24 = 6 \\) dollars\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discount on soap.**\n- Original price of 1 box of soap: $16\n- Discount on soap: 25%\n- Discount amount for 1 box of soap: \\( 16 \\times \\frac{25}{100} = 16 \\times 0.25 = 4 \\) dollars\n- Discounted price for 1 box of soap: \\( 16 - 4 = 12 \\) dollars\n- Discounted price for 5 boxes of soap: \\( 5 \\times 12 = 60 \\) dollars\n- Original price for 5 boxes of soap: \\( 5 \\times 16 = 80 \\) dollars\n- Savings on soap: \\( 80 - 60 = 20 \\) dollars\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total savings.**\n- Total savings on chlorine: $6\n- Total savings on soap: $20\n- Total savings: \\( 6 + 20 = 26 \\) dollars\n\nTherefore, the total amount saved is \\(\\boxed{26}\\)."
