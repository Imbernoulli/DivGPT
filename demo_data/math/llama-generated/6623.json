        "To determine how many bags of chips were sold in the third and fourth weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bags of chips sold in the first two weeks.\n2. Subtract this total from the total number of bags sold in the month to find the number of bags sold in the third and fourth weeks combined.\n3. Since the number of bags sold in the third and fourth weeks is equal, divide the remaining number by 2.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many bags of chips were sold in the second week. According to the problem, the second week had three times as many bags sold as the first week. Since the first week had 15 bags sold, the second week had:\n\\[ 3 \\times 15 = 45 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of bags sold in the first and second weeks to find the total number of bags sold in these two weeks:\n\\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nThe total number of bags sold in the month is 100. Therefore, the number of bags sold in the third and fourth weeks combined is:\n\\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nSince the number of bags sold in the third and fourth weeks is equal, we divide the remaining number of bags by 2:\n\\[ 40 \\div 2 = 20 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nThus, the number of bags of chips sold in each of the third and fourth weeks is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
