        "To determine the total number of broken marbles, we need to calculate the number of broken marbles in each set separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of broken marbles in the first set.

        "To determine the total number of broken marbles in Gabriel's two marble sets, we need to calculate the number of broken marbles in each set separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of broken marbles in the first set. The first set contains 50 marbles, and 10% of them are broken. Therefore, the number of broken marbles in the first set is:\n\\[\n0.10 \\times 50 = 5\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of broken marbles in the second set. The second set contains 60 marbles, and 20% of them are broken. Therefore, the number of broken marbles in the second set is:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 60 = 12\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of broken marbles from both sets to find the total number of broken marbles:\n\\[\n5 + 12 = 17\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of broken marbles is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",
