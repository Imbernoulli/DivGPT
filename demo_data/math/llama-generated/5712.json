        "To determine the total number of balloons Brooke and Tracy will have after Tracy pops half of her balloons, we can break the problem down into a series of steps.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of balloons Brooke has after adding eight more.\n   Brooke starts with 12 balloons and adds 8 more:\n   \\[\n   12 + 8 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, Brooke has 20 balloons.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of balloons Tracy has after adding 24 more.\n   Tracy starts with 6 balloons and adds 24 more:\n   \\[\n   6 + 24 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, Tracy has 30 balloons.\n\n3. Determine how many balloons Tracy has after popping half of them.\n   Tracy pops half of her 30 balloons:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n   So, Tracy has 15 balloons.\n\n4. Calculate the total number of balloons Brooke and Tracy have together.\n   Add the number of balloons Brooke has to the number of balloons Tracy has:\n   \\[\n   20 + 15 = 35\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of balloons they have in total is \\(\\boxed{35}\\)."
