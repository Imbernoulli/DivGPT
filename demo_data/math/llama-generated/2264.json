Some frogs laid eggs, and now there are three times as many tadpoles growing into more frogs as there are frogs. Two-thirds of the tadpoles will survive to maturity as frogs. The pond can only sustain eight frogs. How many frogs will have to find a new pond when the tadpoles grow up?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "Let's start by determining the number of tadpoles in the pond. According to the problem, there are three times as many tadpoles as there are frogs. Since there are 5 frogs, the number of tadpoles is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many of these tadpoles will survive to maturity. The problem states that two-thirds of the tadpoles will survive. Therefore, the number of tadpoles that will become frogs is:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\times 15 = 10 \\]\n\nNow, we add the new frogs to the original number of frogs in the pond. The total number of frogs after the tadpoles grow up is:\n\\[ 5 + 10 = 15 \\]\n\nThe pond can only sustain 8 frogs. Therefore, the number of frogs that will have to find a new pond is:\n\\[ 15 - 8 = 7 \\]\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]",
