        "To determine how many bushels of corn Bob will harvest, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of corn stalks in Bob's garden.\n2. Determine how many bushels of corn are produced by these stalks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of corn stalks. Bob has 5 rows of corn, and each row has 80 corn stalks. So, we multiply the number of rows by the number of stalks per row:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ rows} \\times 80 \\text{ stalks per row} = 400 \\text{ stalks} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many bushels of corn are produced by these 400 stalks. We know that about every 8 corn stalks will produce a bushel of corn. So, we divide the total number of stalks by the number of stalks per bushel:\n\\[ 400 \\text{ stalks} \\div 8 \\text{ stalks per bushel} = 50 \\text{ bushels} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bushels of corn Bob will harvest is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
