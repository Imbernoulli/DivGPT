        "To determine the number of silver beads Michelle uses, we start by calculating the number of each type of bead she uses in the necklace.\n\nFirst, we know that Michelle uses 5 blue beads. Next, we are told that she uses 2 times as many red beads as blue beads. Therefore, the number of red beads is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\n\nThen, we are told that she uses the same number of white beads as the total number of blue and red beads combined. The total number of blue and red beads is:\n\\[ 5 + 10 = 15 \\]\nSo, the number of white beads is:\n\\[ 15 \\]\n\nNow, we know the total number of blue, red, and white beads:\n\\[ 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 \\]\n\nSince the necklace is made up of 40 beads in total, the number of silver beads is the remaining beads after accounting for the blue, red, and white beads:\n\\[ 40 - 30 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of silver beads Michelle uses is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",
