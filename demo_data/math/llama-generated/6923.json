        "To determine how much Winwin was able to take home, we need to account for the tax she paid and the processing fee she incurred. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the tax amount:**\n   Winwin won $50 and paid 20% in tax. To find the tax amount, we multiply the total winnings by the tax percentage.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tax amount} = 50 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 50 \\times 0.20 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, the tax amount is $10.\n\n2. **Calculate the total expenses:**\n   Winwin paid $5 for the processing fee in addition to the tax. Therefore, we add the tax amount and the processing fee to find the total expenses.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total expenses} = 10 + 5 = 15\n   \\]\n   So, the total expenses are $15.\n\n3. **Calculate the take-home amount:**\n   To find out how much Winwin was able to take home, we subtract the total expenses from the total winnings.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Take-home amount} = 50 - 15 = 35\n   \\]\n   So, the take-home amount is $35.\n\nTherefore, the amount Winwin was able to take home is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",
        "To determine how much Winwin was able to take home, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the tax amount.\n2. Subtract the tax amount and the processing fee from the total amount won.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the tax amount. Winwin won $50 and paid 20% in tax. So, we need to find 20% of $50:\n\\[\n\\text{Tax amount} = 50 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 50 \\times 0.20 = 10\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the tax amount and the processing fee from the total amount won. The processing fee is $5. So, we subtract $10 (tax) and $5 (processing fee) from $50:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount taken home} = 50 - 10 - 5 = 35\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Winwin was able to take home is \\boxed{35}.",
