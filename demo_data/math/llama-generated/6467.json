        "To determine the total number of snakes Mary saw, we need to break down the information given and perform the necessary calculations step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of snakes in the breeding balls. Mary sees three breeding balls, and each breeding ball contains 8 snakes. Therefore, the total number of snakes in the breeding balls is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of snakes in the additional pairs. Mary sees 6 additional pairs of snakes. Since each pair consists of 2 snakes, the total number of snakes in the additional pairs is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of snakes from the breeding balls and the number of snakes from the additional pairs to find the total number of snakes Mary saw:\n\\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of snakes Mary saw is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]",

So, the total number of snakes in the breeding balls is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of snakes in the additional pairs. There are 6 pairs of snakes, and each pair consists of 2 snakes. So, the total number of snakes in the additional pairs is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of snakes in the breeding balls to the number of snakes in the additional pairs to find the total number of snakes Mary saw:\n\\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of snakes Mary saw is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of snakes Mary saw, we need to consider both the breeding balls and the additional pairs of snakes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of snakes in the breeding balls:\n- There are 3 breeding balls.\n- Each breeding ball contains 8 snakes.\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ breeding balls} \\times 8 \\text{ snakes per ball} = 24 \\text{ snakes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of snakes in the additional pairs:\n- There are 6 pairs of snakes.\n- Each pair consists of 2 snakes.\n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ pairs} \\times 2 \\text{ snakes per pair} = 12 \\text{ snakes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of snakes from the breeding balls and the additional pairs to find the total number of snakes:\n\n\\[\n24 \\text{ snakes from breeding balls} + 12 \\text{ snakes from additional pairs} = 36 \\text{ snakes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of snakes Mary saw is \\boxed{36}."
