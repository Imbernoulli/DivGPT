        "To determine the total number of cans of milk Jennifer brought home from the store, we start by calculating the additional cans she bought based on the number of cans Mark purchased.\n\nFirst, we know that Mark bought 50 cans of milk. According to the problem, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought. We can set up the following proportion to find out how many additional cans Jennifer bought:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6 \\text{ cans}}{5 \\text{ cans}} = \\frac{x \\text{ cans}}{50 \\text{ cans}}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we can cross-multiply:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 50 = 5 \\times x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n300 = 5x\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{300}{5}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, Jennifer bought 60 additional cans of milk. Since she originally purchased 40 cans, we add the additional cans to the original number:\n\n\\[\n40 + 60 = 100\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cans of milk Jennifer brought home from the store is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{100}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many cans of milk Jennifer brought home from the store, we start by calculating the number of additional cans she bought based on how many cans Mark purchased. According to the problem, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought. Since Mark purchased 50 cans, we first find out how many sets of 5 cans are in 50 cans:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{5} = 10\n\\]\n\nThis means Mark bought 10 sets of 5 cans. Since Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for each set of 5 cans Mark bought, we multiply the number of sets by 6:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 6 = 60\n\\]\n\nJennifer originally bought 40 cans, so we add the 60 additional cans she bought to the original 40 cans:\n\n\\[\n40 + 60 = 100\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cans of milk Jennifer brought home from the store is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{100}\n\\]",

Since she originally bought 40 cans, we add the additional cans to the original number:\n\n\\[\n40 + 60 = 100\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cans of milk Jennifer brought home from the store is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{100}\n\\]",

Therefore, the number of additional cans Jennifer bought is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 6 = 60\n   \\]\n4. To find the total number of cans Jennifer brought home, we add the initial number of cans she purchased to the additional cans she bought:\n   \\[\n   40 + 60 = 100\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cans of milk Jennifer brought home from the store is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",

Calculate the total number of cans Jennifer bought by adding the additional cans to the original number of cans she purchased.\n\nFirst, we know that Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought.

Since Mark purchased 50 cans, we can calculate the number of additional cans Jennifer bought as follows:\n\nFirst, we find out how many sets of 5 cans are in 50 cans:\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{5} = 10\n\\]\nSince Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for each set of 5 cans Mark bought, we multiply the number of sets by 6:\n\\[\n10 \\times 6 = 60\n\\]\n Jennifer initially bought 40 cans, so we add the additional cans she bought to the initial number:\n\\[\n40 + 60 = 100\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of cans of milk Jennifer brought home from the store is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{100}\n\\]",

Mark purchased 50 cans, so we need to find out how many sets of 5 cans are in 50 cans:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{5} = 10\n\\]\n\nSince Jennifer buys 6 additional cans for each set of 5 cans Mark buys, we multiply the number of sets by 6:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 6 = 60\n\\]\n\nJennifer originally bought 40 cans, so we add the additional 60 cans to the original 40 cans:\n\n\\[\n40 + 60 = 100\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cans of milk Jennifer brought home from the store is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{100}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many cans of milk Jennifer brought home, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many additional cans Jennifer bought based on the number of cans Mark bought.\n2. Calculate the total number of cans Jennifer bought.\n\nFirst, we know that Mark purchased 50 cans. According to the problem, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought. Therefore, we can calculate the number of additional cans Jennifer bought by setting up a proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of additional cans Jennifer bought} = \\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right) \\times 50\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right) \\times 50 = 6 \\times 10 = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, Jennifer bought 60 additional cans. Since Jennifer initially bought 40 cans, we add the additional cans to the initial amount to find the total number of cans she brought home:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of cans Jennifer brought home} = 40 + 60 = 100\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cans of milk Jennifer brought home from the store is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",

Calculate the additional cans Jennifer bought based on the number of cans Mark bought.\n3. Add the additional cans Jennifer bought to the original number of cans she purchased.\n\nFirst, we know that Mark purchased 50 cans. According to the problem, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought. Therefore, we need to find out how many sets of 5 cans are in the 50 cans Mark bought:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{5} = 10\n\\]\n\nSince Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for each set of 5 cans Mark bought, we multiply the number of sets by 6:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 6 = 60\n\\]\n\nJennifer originally bought 40 cans. Adding the 60 additional cans she bought gives us the total number of cans she brought home:\n\n\\[\n40 + 60 = 100\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of cans of milk Jennifer brought home from the store is \\boxed{100}.",

According to the problem, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought. Therefore, we can calculate the number of additional cans Jennifer bought by setting up a proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of additional cans Jennifer bought} = \\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right) \\times 50\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right) \\times 50 = 6 \\times 10 = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, Jennifer bought 60 additional cans of milk. Since she initially bought 40 cans, we add the additional cans to the original number:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of cans Jennifer brought home} = 40 + 60 = 100\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of cans of milk Jennifer brought home from the store is \\(\\boxed{100}\\)."
