        "To determine the total number of students in the special school, we need to find out how many blind students there are and then add that number to the number of deaf students.\n\n1. Let \\( B \\) represent the number of blind students.\n2. According to the problem, the number of deaf students is three times the number of blind students. Therefore, we can express the number of deaf students as \\( 3B \\).\n3. We are given that the number of deaf students is 180. So, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   3B = 180\n   \\]\n4.

Let \\( B \\) represent the number of blind students.\n2. According to the problem, the number of deaf students is three times the number of blind students. Therefore, we can express the number of deaf students as \\( 3B \\).\n3. We are given that the number of deaf students is 180. So, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   3B = 180\n   \\]\n4. To find \\( B \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{180}{3} = 60\n   \\]\n5. Now we know there are 60 blind students.\n6. To find the total number of students, we add the number of deaf students and the number of blind students:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of students} = \\text{Number of deaf students} + \\text{Number of blind students} = 180 + 60 = 240\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students at the school is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",
