Therefore, the total number of plants is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ rows} \\times 10 \\text{ plants per row} = 300 \\text{ plants} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total yield of tomatoes. Each plant yields 20 pieces of tomatoes. Therefore, the total yield from all the plants is:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ plants} \\times 20 \\text{ pieces per plant} = 6000 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of pieces of tomatoes the farmer can get is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6000}\n\\]",
