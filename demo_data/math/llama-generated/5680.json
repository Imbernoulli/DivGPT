She often loses them in various ways, and her owner needs to replace them. On Monday, Daisy played with 5 dog toys. On Tuesday, Daisy had 3 dog toys left after losing some, and her owner went to the store and got her 3 more. On Wednesday, all of Daisy's old and new dog toys were missing, so her owner went to the store and bought her 5 more. If Daisy's owner found all the lost dog toys, including the new dog toys, how many dog toys would Daisy have now?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Monday**: Daisy played with 5 dog toys.\n2. **Tuesday**: Daisy had 3 dog toys left after losing some. This means she lost \\(5 - 3 = 2\\) dog toys. Her owner then bought her 3 more dog toys. So, the total number of dog toys Daisy had at the end of Tuesday is \\(3 + 3 = 6\\).\n3. **Wednesday**: All of Daisy's dog toys were missing. This means she lost all 6 dog toys she had from Tuesday. Her owner then bought her 5 more dog toys. So, the total number of dog toys Daisy had at the end of Wednesday is 5.\n\nNow, if Daisy's owner found all the lost dog toys, including the new dog toys, we need to add back all the dog toys Daisy lost.
