        "To determine how many more students are wearing striped shirts than shorts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students wearing striped shirts.\n2. Calculate the number of students wearing checkered shirts.\n3. Determine the number of students wearing shorts.\n4. Find the difference between the number of students wearing striped shirts and the number of students wearing shorts.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of students wearing striped shirts.**\n\nThe classroom has 81 students, and two-thirds of them are wearing striped shirts.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students wearing striped shirts} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 81 = 54\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of students wearing checkered shirts.**\n\nThe rest of the students are wearing checkered shirts. Since there are 81 students in total and 54 are wearing striped shirts, the number of students wearing checkered shirts is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students wearing checkered shirts} = 81 - 54 = 27\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of students wearing shorts.**\n\nThere are 19 more students wearing shorts than checkered shirts. Therefore, the number of students wearing shorts is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students wearing shorts} = 27 + 19 = 46\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the difference between the number of students wearing striped shirts and the number of students wearing shorts.**\n\nThe difference between the number of students wearing striped shirts and the number of students wearing shorts is:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 54 - 46 = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students wearing striped shirts is \\(\\boxed{8}\\) more than the number of students wearing shorts.",

Since two-thirds of the 81 students are wearing striped shirts, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students wearing striped shirts} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 81 = 54\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of students wearing checkered shirts. Since the rest of the students are wearing checkered shirts, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students wearing checkered shirts} = 81 - 54 = 27\n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine the number of students wearing shorts. According to the problem, there are 19 more students wearing shorts than checkered shirts, so we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students wearing shorts} = 27 + 19 = 46\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of students wearing striped shirts and the number of students wearing shorts:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 54 - 46 = 8\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are \\(\\boxed{8}\\) more students wearing striped shirts than shorts.",
