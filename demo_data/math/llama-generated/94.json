        "To determine how many miles still need to be added to the highway to finish extending it, we start by calculating the total length of the highway after the first two days of construction.\n\nThe initial length of the highway is 200 miles. On the first day, 50 miles are built. Therefore, the length of the highway after the first day is:\n\\[ 200 + 50 = 250 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nOn the second day, three times the amount built on the first day is built. Since 50 miles were built on the first day, three times this amount is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 50 = 150 \\text{ miles} \\]\nAdding this to the length of the highway after the first day, we get:\n\\[ 250 + 150 = 400 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThe final length of the highway is 650 miles. Therefore, the number of miles still needed to be added to the highway is:\n\\[ 650 - 400 = 250 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThus, the number of miles still needed to be added to the highway to finish extending it is:\n\\[ \\boxed{250} \\]",

        "To determine how many miles still need to be added to the highway to finish extending it, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total length of the highway built over the first two days.\n2. Subtract the total length built from the difference between the final length and the current length.\n\nFirst, let's find the total length of the highway built over the first two days:\n- On the first day, 50 miles are built.\n- On the second day, three times the amount built on the first day are built, which is \\(3 \\times 50 = 150\\) miles.\n- Therefore, the total length built over the two days is \\(50 + 150 = 200\\) miles.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many miles are still needed to extend the highway. The highway is being extended from 200 miles to 650 miles, so the total extension required is \\(650 - 200 = 450\\) miles. Since 200 miles have already been built, the remaining length to be built is \\(450 - 200 = 250\\) miles.\n\nThus, the number of miles still needed to be added to the highway to finish extending it is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",
