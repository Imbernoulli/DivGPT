Calculate the FICA taxes Janet has to pay.\n5. Add the total monthly wage and the FICA taxes to get the total amount Janet owes.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. **Calculate the total monthly wage for the warehouse workers:**\n   - Each warehouse worker makes $15/hour and works 8 hours a day.\n   - Therefore, the daily wage for each warehouse worker is \\(15 \\times 8 = 120\\) dollars.\n   - Each warehouse worker works 25 days a month, so the monthly wage for each warehouse worker is \\(120 \\times 25 = 3000\\) dollars.\n   - Since there are 4 warehouse workers, the total monthly wage for all warehouse workers is \\(4 \\times 3000 = 12000\\) dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate the total monthly wage for the managers:**\n   - Each manager makes $20/hour and works 8 hours a day.\n   - Therefore, the daily wage for each manager is \\(20 \\times 8 = 160\\) dollars.\n   - Each manager works 25 days a month, so the monthly wage for each manager is \\(160 \\times 25 = 4000\\) dollars.\n   - Since there are 2 managers, the total monthly wage for all managers is \\(2 \\times 4000 = 8000\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Add the total wages of the warehouse workers and the managers to get the total monthly wage for all employees:**\n   - The total monthly wage for all employees is \\(12000 + 8000 = 20000\\) dollars.\n\n4. **Calculate the FICA taxes Janet has to pay:**\n   - Janet has to pay 10% of her workers' salaries in FICA taxes.\n   - Therefore, the FICA taxes are \\(0.10 \\times 20000 = 2000\\) dollars.\n\n5. **Add the total monthly wage and the FICA taxes to get the total amount Janet owes:**\n   - The total amount Janet owes is \\(20000 + 2000 = 22000\\) dollars.\n\nThus, the total amount Janet owes for her employees' wages and taxes for one month is \\(\\boxed{22000}\\).",

Add the total monthly wage to the FICA taxes to get the total amount Janet owes.\n\nLet's start with the warehouse workers:\n- Each warehouse worker makes $15/hour and works 25 days a month for 8 hours a day.\n- The monthly wage for one warehouse worker is $15 * 25 * 8 = $3000.\n- Since there are 4 warehouse workers, the total monthly wage for all warehouse workers is $3000 * 4 = $12000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total monthly wage for the managers:\n- Each manager makes $20/hour and works 25 days a month for 8 hours a day.\n- The monthly wage for one manager is $20 * 25 * 8 = $4000.\n- Since there are 2 managers, the total monthly wage for all managers is $4000 * 2 = $8000.\n\nNow, we add the total wages of the warehouse workers and the managers to get the total monthly wage for all employees:\n- The total monthly wage for all employees is $12000 + $8000 = $20000.\n\nNext, we calculate the FICA taxes by taking 10% of the total monthly wage:\n- The FICA taxes are $20000 * 0.10 = $2000.\n\nFinally, we add the total monthly wage to the FICA taxes to get the total amount Janet owes:\n- The total amount Janet owes is $20000 + $2000 = $22000.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Janet owes for their wages and taxes for one month is \\boxed{22000}.",

Add the FICA taxes to the total monthly wage to get the total amount Janet owes.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total monthly wage for the warehouse workers.**\n\nEach warehouse worker makes $15/hour and works 8 hours a day for 25 days a month.\n\\[ \\text{Monthly wage per warehouse worker} = 15 \\times 8 \\times 25 = 3000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince there are 4 warehouse workers:\n\\[ \\text{Total monthly wage for warehouse workers} = 4 \\times 3000 = 12000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total monthly wage for the managers.**\n\nEach manager makes $20/hour and works 8 hours a day for 25 days a month.\n\\[ \\text{Monthly wage per manager} = 20 \\times 8 \\times 25 = 4000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince there are 2 managers:\n\\[ \\text{Total monthly wage for managers} = 2 \\times 4000 = 8000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the total monthly wages of the warehouse workers and the managers to get the total monthly wage for all employees.**\n\n\\[ \\text{Total monthly wage for all employees} = 12000 + 8000 = 20000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the FICA taxes Janet has to pay.**\n\nJanet has to pay 10% of her workers' salaries in FICA taxes.\n\\[ \\text{FICA taxes} = 0.10 \\times 20000 = 2000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 5: Add the FICA taxes to the total monthly wage to get the total amount Janet owes.**\n\n\\[ \\text{Total amount Janet owes} = 20000 + 2000 = 22000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Janet owes for their wages and taxes for one month is \\(\\boxed{22000}\\).",
        "To determine how much Janet owes in total for her employees' wages and taxes for one month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total monthly wage for the warehouse workers.\n2. Calculate the total monthly wage for the managers.\n3. Add the total wages of the warehouse workers and the managers to get the total monthly wage for all employees.\n4. Calculate the FICA taxes by taking 10% of the total monthly wage.\n5. Add the total monthly wage and the FICA taxes to get the total amount Janet owes.\n\nLet's start with the warehouse workers. There are four warehouse workers, each making $15/hour, working 25 days a month, and 8 hours a day. So, the monthly wage for one warehouse worker is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 8 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 25 \\text{ days/month} = 3000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\nSince there are four warehouse workers, the total monthly wage for all warehouse workers is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 3000 \\text{ dollars/month} = 12000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total monthly wage for the managers. There are two managers, each making $20/hour, working 25 days a month, and 8 hours a day. So, the monthly wage for one manager is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 8 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 25 \\text{ days/month} = 4000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\nSince there are two managers, the total monthly wage for all managers is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4000 \\text{ dollars/month} = 8000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\nNow, we add the total monthly wages of the warehouse workers and the managers to get the total monthly wage for all employees:\n\\[ 12000 \\text{ dollars/month} + 8000 \\text{ dollars/month} = 20000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the FICA taxes by taking 10% of the total monthly wage:\n\\[ 0.10 \\times 20000 \\text{ dollars/month} = 2000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total monthly wage and the FICA taxes to get the total amount Janet owes:\n\\[ 20000 \\text{ dollars/month} + 2000 \\text{ dollars/month} = 22000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Janet owes for her employees' wages and taxes for one month is:\n\\[ \\boxed{22000} \\]",
        "To determine how much Janet owes for her workers' wages and taxes for one month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the daily wage for each type of employee:**\n   - Warehouse workers: \\( \\$15/\\text{hour} \\times 8 \\text{ hours/day} = \\$120/\\text{day} \\)\n   - Managers: \\( \\$20/\\text{hour} \\times 8 \\text{ hours/day} = \\$160/\\text{day} \\)\n\n2. **Calculate the monthly wage for each type of employee:**\n   - Warehouse workers: \\( \\$120/\\text{day} \\times 25 \\text{ days/month} = \\$3000/\\text{month} \\)\n   - Managers: \\( \\$160/\\text{day} \\times 25 \\text{ days/month} = \\$4000/\\text{month} \\)\n\n3. **Calculate the total monthly wage for all employees:**\n   - Total wage for warehouse workers: \\( 4 \\times \\$3000/\\text{month} = \\$12000/\\text{month} \\)\n   - Total wage for managers: \\( 2 \\times \\$4000/\\text{month} = \\$8000/\\text{month} \\)\n   - Total wage for all employees: \\( \\$12000/\\text{month} + \\$8000/\\text{month} = \\$20000/\\text{month} \\)\n\n4. **Calculate the FICA taxes Janet has to pay:**\n   - FICA tax rate: 10%\n   - Total FICA taxes: \\( 10\\% \\times \\$20000 = 0.10 \\times \\$20000 = \\$2000 \\)\n\n5. **Calculate the total amount Janet owes for wages and taxes:**\n   - Total amount owed: \\( \\$20000 + \\$2000 = \\$22000 \\)\n\nTherefore, Janet owes a total of \\(\\boxed{22000}\\) for her workers' wages and taxes for one month."
