        "To determine how many frogs hatch out of the 800 eggs laid by the frog, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of eggs that dry up.\n2. Calculate the number of eggs that are eaten.\n3. Determine the number of eggs that remain after the eggs that dry up and are eaten are subtracted.\n4. Calculate how many of the remaining eggs hatch.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The frog lays 800 eggs each year, and 10 percent of these eggs dry up. Therefore, the number of eggs that dry up is:\n\\[ 800 \\times 0.10 = 80 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of eggs that are eaten. 70 percent of the eggs are eaten. Therefore, the number of eggs that are eaten is:\n\\[ 800 \\times 0.70 = 560 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of eggs that dry up and the number of eggs that are eaten from the total number of eggs laid to find out how many eggs remain:\n\\[ 800 - 80 - 560 = 160 \\]\n\nFinally, we know that 1/4 of the remaining eggs end up hatching. Therefore, the number of eggs that hatch is:\n\\[ 160 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 40 \\]\n\nSo, the number of frogs that hatch out of the 800 eggs is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",

Calculate the number of eggs that hatch.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs that dry up.**\n\nThe frog lays 800 eggs, and 10 percent of them dry up.\n\\[ 10\\% \\text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \\times 800 = 80 \\]\nSo, 80 eggs dry up.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs that are eaten.**\n\n70 percent of the eggs are eaten.\n\\[ 70\\% \\text{ of } 800 = 0.70 \\times 800 = 560 \\]\nSo, 560 eggs are eaten.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of eggs that remain after some dry up and some are eaten.**\n\nFirst, subtract the number of eggs that dry up and the number of eggs that are eaten from the total number of eggs laid.\n\\[ 800 - 80 - 560 = 160 \\]\nSo, 160 eggs remain.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of eggs that hatch.**\n\n1/4 of the remaining eggs end up hatching.\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ of } 160 = \\frac{160}{4} = 40 \\]\nSo, 40 eggs hatch.\n\nTherefore, the number of frogs that hatch out of the 800 eggs is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
