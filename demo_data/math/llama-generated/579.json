        "To determine how many trees James planted, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of plants on both trees.\n2. Determine the total number of seeds from all the plants.\n3. Calculate how many seeds James planted (60% of the total seeds).\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of plants on both trees. Since each tree has 20 plants and there are 2 trees, the total number of plants is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\]\n\nNext, since each plant has 1 seed, the total number of seeds is the same as the total number of plants, which is:\n\\[ 40 \\]\n\nJames plants 60% of these seeds. To find out how many seeds he planted, we calculate 60% of 40:\n\\[ 0.60 \\times 40 = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of trees James planted is:\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]",
