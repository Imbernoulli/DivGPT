        "To determine Susan's age in 5 years, we need to follow a step-by-step approach to find the current ages of James, Janet, and Susan.\n\nFirst, let's find James's current age. We know that in 15 years James will turn 37. Therefore, we can calculate James's current age as follows:\n\\[ \\text{James's current age} = 37 - 15 = 22 \\]\n\nNext, we know that 8 years ago, James was twice Janet's age. So, we need to find Janet's age 8 years ago. If James's current age is 22, then 8 years ago James was:\n\\[ 22 - 8 = 14 \\]\nSince 8 years ago James was twice Janet's age, Janet's age 8 years ago was:\n\\[ \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\]\nTherefore, Janet's current age is:\n\\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \\]\n\nSusan was born when Janet turned 3. So, the difference in age between Janet and Susan is:\n\\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \\]\nThis means Susan is currently 12 years old. In 5 years, Susan's age will be:\n\\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \\]\n\nThus, Susan will turn \\(\\boxed{17}\\) in 5 years.",

According to the problem, eight years ago James was twice Janet's age, so we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   14 = 2(J - 8)\n   \\]\n   Simplify the right side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   14 = 2J - 16\n   \\]\n   Add 16 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   30 = 2J\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   J = 15\n   \\]\n   So, Janet is currently 15 years old.\n\n3. **Determine Susan's current age:**\n   We know that Susan was born when Janet turned 3.
