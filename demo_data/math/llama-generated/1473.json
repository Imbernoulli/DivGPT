        "To determine how many eggs Jason will consume in two weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of eggs Jason consumes in one day.\n2. Calculate the number of eggs Jason consumes in one week.\n3. Calculate the number of eggs Jason consumes in two weeks.\n\nFirst, we know that Jason eats 3 eggs every morning. Therefore, the number of eggs he consumes in one day is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ eggs/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many eggs Jason consumes in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs he consumes in one day by 7:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ eggs/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 21 \\text{ eggs/week} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many eggs Jason consumes in two weeks. Since there are 2 weeks, we multiply the number of eggs he consumes in one week by 2:\n\\[ 21 \\text{ eggs/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 42 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs Jason will consume in two weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{42} \\]",
