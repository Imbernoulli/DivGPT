Subtract the amount James pays from his initial amount of money.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1.

Since the roommate pays $175, James pays the remaining half of the total cost:\n   \\[\n   350 - 175 = 175\n   \\]\n\n5. Finally, we subtract the amount James pays from his initial amount of money. James initially had $500 in the bank, so the amount of money he has left is:\n   \\[\n   500 - 175 = 325\n   \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money James has left is \\(\\boxed{325}\\).",
