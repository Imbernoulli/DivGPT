        "To determine the total number of commencement addresses given by Governor Sandoval, Governor Hawkins, and Governor Sloan, we start by identifying the number of addresses each governor gave.\n\nFirst, we know that Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses. According to the problem, Governor Sandoval gave twice as many commencement addresses as Governor Hawkins. Therefore, we can find the number of addresses given by Governor Hawkins by dividing the number of addresses given by Governor Sandoval by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of addresses given by Governor Hawkins} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval. Therefore, we can find the number of addresses given by Governor Sloan by adding 10 to the number of addresses given by Governor Sandoval:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of addresses given by Governor Sloan} = 12 + 10 = 22\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of addresses given by all three governors to find the total number of commencement addresses:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of addresses} = 12 + 6 + 22 = 40\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of commencement addresses given by the three governors is \\boxed{40}.",
