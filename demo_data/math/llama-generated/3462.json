He read 5 fewer pages than he did yesterday. Since he read 35 pages yesterday, we can calculate the number of pages he read today as follows:\n\\[ 35 - 5 = 30 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of pages he read yesterday and today to find the total number of pages he has read so far:\n\\[ 35 + 30 = 65 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of pages read so far from the total number of pages in the book to find out how many pages he still needs to read:\n\\[ 100 - 65 = 35 \\]\n\nTherefore, Lance should read \\(\\boxed{35}\\) pages tomorrow to finish the book.",
