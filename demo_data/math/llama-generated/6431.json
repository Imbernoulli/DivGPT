        "To determine how many stickers Clara has left, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of stickers Clara has, which is 100.\n2. Clara gives 10 stickers to a boy she likes. So, we subtract 10 from 100:\n   \\[\n   100 - 10 = 90\n   \\]\n   Clara now has 90 stickers left.\n3. Clara gives half of the remaining stickers to her best friends. So, we need to find half of 90:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n   \\]\n   Clara gives 45 stickers to her best friends. Therefore, we subtract 45 from 90:\n   \\[\n   90 - 45 = 45\n   \\]\n   Clara now has 45 stickers left.\n\nThe number of stickers Clara has left is \\boxed{45}.",
