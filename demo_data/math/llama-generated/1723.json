        "To determine the discount Clark received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the parts before the discount. Each part costs $80, and Clark buys 7 of them. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:\n\n\\[ 80 \\times 7 = 560 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Clark paid $439 after the discount. The discount amount is the difference between the original total cost and the amount Clark paid. So, we subtract the amount Clark paid from the original total cost:\n\n\\[ 560 - 439 = 121 \\]\n\nThus, the discount Clark received is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{121} \\]",
