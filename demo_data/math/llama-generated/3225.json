The first job involves fixing three toilets and three sinks at an apartment complex.  The second involves two toilets and five sinks at a different apartment complex.  The third involves fixing one toilet, two showers and three sinks at a third apartment complex.  If the plumber charges $30 to fix a sink, $40 to fix a shower and $50 to fix a toilet, what is the most money the plumber can earn if he can only choose one of these three jobs?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
