        "Let's denote the cost of the repair fee as \\( R \\). According to the problem, \\( R = 10 \\) dollars. The cost of the corner light is twice the repair fee, so the cost of the corner light is \\( 2R = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\) dollars. The cost of each brake disk is three times the cost of the corner light, so the cost of each brake disk is \\( 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\) dollars. Since Robe bought two brake disks, the total cost of the brake disks is \\( 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money Robe spent on the repair and the spare parts. This is the sum of the repair fee, the cost of the corner light, and the cost of the brake disks:\n\\[\nR + 20 + 120 = 10 + 20 + 120 = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nLet's denote the amount of money Robe had saved before his car broke as \\( S \\). According to the problem, after spending $150, Robe had $480 left. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\nS - 150 = 480\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( S \\), we add 150 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nS = 480 + 150 = 630\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Robe had saved before his car broke is \\(\\boxed{630}\\).",
        "To determine how much money Robe had saved before his car broke, we need to calculate the total amount he spent on the repair and the spare parts and then add this total to the amount he had left after the expenses.\n\nFirst, let's find out the cost of the corner light. Since the corner light costs twice the price of the repair fee, and the repair fee is $10, the cost of the corner light is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the cost of the two brake disks. Each brake disk costs three times the price of the corner light, so each brake disk costs:\n\\[ 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nSince there are two brake disks, the total cost for the brake disks is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's add up the total cost of the repair fee, the corner light, and the two brake disks:\n\\[ 10 + 20 + 120 = 150 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nRobe had $480 left after spending $150.
