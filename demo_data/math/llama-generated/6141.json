        "To determine how much Miley paid for the two cellphones, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the two cellphones before the discount.\n2. Determine the discount amount.\n3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the two cellphones before the discount.**\n\nEach cellphone costs $800, and Miley is buying two cellphones.\n\\[\n800 \\times 2 = 1600\n\\]\nSo, the total cost before the discount is $1600.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the discount amount.**\n\nMiley receives a 5% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we calculate 5% of $1600.\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{100} \\times 1600 = 0.05 \\times 1600 = 80\n\\]\nSo, the discount amount is $80.\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost.**\n\nTo find the final amount Miley paid, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount.\n\\[\n1600 - 80 = 1520\n\\]\nSo, the amount Miley paid is \\(\\boxed{1520}\\).",
        "To determine how much Miley paid for the two cellphones after receiving the discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the two cellphones without the discount.\n2. Determine the amount of the discount.\n3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the two cellphones without the discount:\n\\[\n800 \\text{ dollars/cellphone} \\times 2 \\text{ cellphones} = 1600 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of the discount.

To find 5% of $1600, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Discount amount} = \\text{Total cost} \\times \\frac{\\text{Discount rate}}{100} \\]\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Discount amount} = 1600 \\times \\frac{5}{100} = 1600 \\times 0.05 = 80 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid:\n\\[ \\text{Final amount paid} = \\text{Total cost} - \\text{Discount amount} = 1600 - 80 = 1520 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Miley paid is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1520} \\]",
