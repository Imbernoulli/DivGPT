Therefore, Ember's current age is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n3. Determine the difference in age between Nate and Ember:\n   The difference in age between Nate and Ember is:\n   \\[\n   14 - 7 = 7 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n   This difference will remain constant over time.\n\n4. Calculate Nate's age when Ember is 14:\n   When Ember is 14 years old, Nate will be 7 years older than Ember.
