        "To determine how many more bags at maximum weight the plane can hold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of the luggage that the 6 people are bringing.\n2. Subtract this total weight from the maximum luggage weight the airplane can hold to find out how much additional weight the plane can still carry.\n3. Determine how many more bags at the maximum weight (50 pounds each) can fit into the remaining weight.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of the luggage that the 6 people are bringing:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ people} \\times 5 \\text{ bags per person} \\times 50 \\text{ pounds per bag} = 1500 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract this total weight from the maximum luggage weight the airplane can hold:\n\\[\n6000 \\text{ pounds} - 1500 \\text{ pounds} = 4500 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we determine how many more bags at the maximum weight (50 pounds each) can fit into the remaining weight:\n\\[\n4500 \\text{ pounds} \\div 50 \\text{ pounds per bag} = 90 \\text{ bags}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the plane can hold \\(\\boxed{90}\\) more bags at maximum weight.",
