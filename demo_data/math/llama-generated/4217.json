        "To determine how much money Janice makes in a week where she works 60 hours, we need to break down her pay into two parts: the pay for the first 40 hours and the pay for the overtime hours.\n\n1.

Calculate the pay for the overtime hours:\n   Janice gets paid $15 per hour for any hours worked beyond 40 hours. Since she worked 60 hours in total, the number of overtime hours is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ hours} - 40 \\text{ hours} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   So, the pay for the overtime hours is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$15/\\text{hour} = \\$300\n   \\]\n\n3. Add the pay for the first 40 hours and the pay for the overtime hours to get the total pay for the week:\n   \\[\n   \\$400 + \\$300 = \\$700\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Janice makes in the week is \\(\\boxed{700}\\).",
