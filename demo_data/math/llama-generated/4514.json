Sandy keeps 500,000 tokens for herself. To find out how many more tokens Sandy has than any of her siblings, we subtract the number of tokens each sibling gets from the number of tokens Sandy keeps:\n\\[ 500,000 - 125,000 = 375,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, Sandy has \\(\\boxed{375000}\\) more tokens than any of her siblings.",

After keeping half of the tokens, the remaining tokens are:\n   \\[\n   1,000,000 - 500,000 = 500,000\n   \\]\n\n3. Sandy has 4 siblings, so she will divide the remaining 500,000 tokens equally among them. The number of tokens each sibling will get is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{500,000}{4} = 125,000\n   \\]\n\n4. To find out how many more tokens Sandy will have than any of her siblings, we subtract the number of tokens each sibling gets from the number of tokens Sandy keeps:\n   \\[\n   500,000 - 125,000 = 375,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Sandy will have \\(\\boxed{375000}\\) more tokens than any of her siblings.",
