        "To determine how many touchdowns per game Richard must average in the final two games to beat Archie's record, we start by calculating the total number of touchdowns Richard has already thrown in the first 14 games. Since he has averaged 6 touchdowns per game for 14 games, we multiply:\n\n\\[ 6 \\text{ touchdowns/game} \\times 14 \\text{ games} = 84 \\text{ touchdowns} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more touchdowns Richard needs to throw to exceed Archie's record of 89 touchdowns. Since Richard already has 84 touchdowns, he needs:\n\n\\[ 89 + 1 = 90 \\text{ touchdowns} \\]\n\nThis means Richard needs a total of \\( 90 - 84 = 6 \\) more touchdowns in the final two games. To find out how many touchdowns per game he must average in these two games, we divide the remaining number of touchdowns by the number of games left:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6 \\text{ touchdowns}}{2 \\text{ games}} = 3 \\text{ touchdowns/game} \\]\n\nTherefore, Richard must average \\(\\boxed{3}\\) touchdowns per game in the final two games to beat Archie's record.",

To find out how many touchdowns per game he must average, we divide the total number of touchdowns needed by the number of games remaining:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6 \\text{ touchdowns}}{2 \\text{ games}} = 3 \\text{ touchdowns/game} \\]\n\nTherefore, Richard must average \\(\\boxed{3}\\) touchdowns per game in the final two games to beat Archie's record.",

Since Richard needs to have more than 89 touchdowns to break the record, we calculate:\n\\[ 89 + 1 = 90 \\text{ touchdowns} \\]\n\\[ 90 \\text{ touchdowns} - 84 \\text{ touchdowns} = 6 \\text{ touchdowns} \\]\n\nRichard needs to throw 6 more touchdowns in the final two games.

Since he has averaged 6 touchdowns per game, we multiply:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times 14 = 84 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more touchdowns Richard needs to throw to exceed Archie's record of 89 touchdowns. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of touchdowns Richard needs to throw in the final two games. Then, the total number of touchdowns he will have thrown in the entire season is:\n\n\\[ 84 + x \\]\n\nFor Richard to beat Archie's record, this total must be greater than 89:\n\n\\[ 84 + x > 89 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 84 from both sides of the inequality:\n\n\\[ x > 5 \\]\n\nThis means Richard needs to throw more than 5 touchdowns in the final two games. To find the average number of touchdowns per game he needs to throw, we divide 5 by 2 and then add a small increment to ensure he exceeds 5 total touchdowns in 2 games.

        "To determine how many touchdowns per game Richard must average in the final two games to beat Archie's record, we start by calculating the total number of touchdowns Richard has already thrown in the first 14 games.\n\nSince Richard has averaged 6 touchdowns per game for 14 games, we can calculate the total number of touchdowns as follows:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ touchdowns/game} \\times 14 \\text{ games} = 84 \\text{ touchdowns}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more touchdowns Richard needs to throw in the final two games to exceeding Archie's record of 89 touchdowns. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of touchdowns Richard needs to throw in the final two games. The total number of touchdowns Richard will have after the final two games is:\n\\[\n84 + x\n\\]\n\nTo beat Archie's record, this total must be greater than 89:\n\\[\n84 + x > 89\n\\]\n\nSubtract 84 from both sides of the inequality to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx > 5\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) represents the total number of touchdowns Richard needs to throw in the final two games, and we need to find the average number of touchdowns per game, we divide \\( x \\) by 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} > \\frac{5}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} > 2.5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Richard must average more than 2.5 touchdowns per game in the final two games to beat Archie's record. Since the number of touchdowns per game must be a whole number (you can't throw half a touchdown), the smallest possible average that satisfies this inequality is 3 touchdowns per game.\n\nThus, Richard must average \\(\\boxed{3}\\) touchdowns per game in the final two games to beat Archie's record.",
        "To determine how many touchdowns per game Richard must average in the final two games to beat Archie's record of 89 touchdown passes, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of touchdowns Richard has already thrown in the first 14 games.\n2. Determine how many more touchdowns Richard needs to throw to break Archie's record.\n3. Find out how many touchdowns Richard needs to average per game in the final two games to achieve this.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of touchdowns Richard has thrown in the first 14 games:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ touchdowns/game} \\times 14 \\text{ games} = 84 \\text{ touchdowns} \\]\n\nNext, determine how many more touchdowns Richard needs to throw to break Archie's record of 89 touchdowns. Since Richard needs to throw more than 89 touchdowns, we calculate:\n\\[ 89 + 1 = 90 \\text{ touchdowns} \\]\nSo, Richard needs:\n\\[ 90 - 84 = 6 \\text{ touchdowns} \\]\n\nNow, find out how many touchdowns Richard needs to average per game in the final two games to throw 6 more touchdowns. Let \\( x \\) be the average number of touchdowns Richard needs to throw per game in the final two games. Then:\n\\[ 2x = 6 \\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, Richard must average \\(\\boxed{3}\\) touchdowns per game in the final two games to beat Archie's record.",
