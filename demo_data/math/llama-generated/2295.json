        "To determine how much money Bill has now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the three pizzas.\n2. Determine how much money Frank paid for the pizzas.\n3.

The cost of each pizza is $11, and they bought 3 pizzas.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 11 = 33\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the three pizzas is $33.\n\n2. Frank paid for all three pizzas, so he paid $33.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Frank's payment} = 33\n   \\]\n\n3. Frank and Bill initially had $42 together. After Frank paid $33, the amount of money Frank has left is:\n   \\[\n   42 - 33 = 9\n   \\]\n   So, Frank has $9 left.\n\n4. Bill had $30 already. After Frank gave him $9, the total amount of money Bill has now is:\n   \\[\n   30 + 9 = 39\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Bill has now is \\(\\boxed{39}\\).",

Bill originally had $30, so we add the $9 Frank gave him to Bill's original amount:\n\\[\n\\$30 + \\$9 = \\$39\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Bill has now is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{39}\n\\]",
        "First, we determine the total cost of the three large pizzas. Since each pizza costs $11, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 11 = 33\n\\]\n\nFrank paid for all three pizzas, so he spent $33. Frank and Bill together initially had $42, so after paying for the pizzas, Frank has:\n\n\\[\n42 - 33 = 9\n\\]\n\nFrank gave all of his remaining money to Bill. Therefore, Bill now has his original $30 plus the $9 Frank gave him:\n\n\\[\n30 + 9 = 39\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Bill has now is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{39}\n\\]",
        "Let's start by calculating the total cost of the three large pizzas. Since each pizza costs $11, we multiply the cost of one pizza by the number of pizzas:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 11 = 33\n\\]\n\nThis means the total cost of the three pizzas is $33. Frank paid for all three pizzas, so he spent $33 on the pizzas. Frank and Bill together initially had $42, so after Frank paid for the pizzas, the amount of money Frank had left is:\n\n\\[\n42 - 33 = 9\n\\]\n\nFrank gave all of his remaining money to Bill. Therefore, Bill now has the amount of money he originally had plus the money Frank gave him.
