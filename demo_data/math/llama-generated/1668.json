        "To determine how many square yards of sod Archie needs for his backyard, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the area of the entire backyard.\n2. Calculate the area of the shed.\n3. Subtract the area of the shed from the area of the entire backyard to find the area that needs sod.\n\nFirst, we calculate the area of the entire backyard. The backyard is a rectangle with a length of 20 yards and a width of 13 yards. The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[ A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\]\nSo, the area of the backyard is:\n\\[ A_{\\text{backyard}} = 20 \\times 13 = 260 \\text{ square yards} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the shed. The shed is a rectangle with a length of 3 yards and a width of 5 yards. Using the same area formula, the area of the shed is:\n\\[ A_{\\text{shed}} = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ square yards} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the area of the shed from the area of the backyard to find the area that needs sod:\n\\[ A_{\\text{sod}} = A_{\\text{backyard}} - A_{\\text{shed}} = 260 - 15 = 245 \\text{ square yards} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of square yards of sod Archie needs for his backyard is:\n\\[ \\boxed{245} \\]",
