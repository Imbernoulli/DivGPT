Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.55 \\times 500 = 275\n\\]\nSo, the winner received 275 votes.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of votes the loser received. The loser got the remaining votes, which is 100% - 55% = 45% of the votes. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.45 \\times 500 = 225\n\\]\nSo, the loser received 225 votes.\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of votes the winner received and the number of votes the loser received:\n\\[\n275 - 225 = 50\n\\]\nSo, the winner got \\(\\boxed{50}\\) more votes than the loser.",
