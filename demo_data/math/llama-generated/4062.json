        "To determine the total amount Mr. Benson paid for the concert tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of tickets that receive a discount.\n2. Calculate the discount amount.\n3. Subtract the discount from the total cost of the tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many tickets receive a discount. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets, and he receives a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. Therefore, the number of tickets that receive a discount is:\n\\[ 12 - 10 = 2 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the discount amount. Since each discounted ticket costs $40 and the discount is 5%, the discount per ticket is:\n\\[ 40 \\times \\frac{5}{100} = 40 \\times 0.05 = 2 \\]\nSo, the total discount for 2 tickets is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total discount from the total cost of the tickets. The total cost of the tickets without the discount is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 40 = 480 \\]\nTherefore, the total amount Mr. Benson paid after the discount is:\n\\[ 480 - 4 = 476 \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{476} \\]",

        "To determine the total cost Mr. Benson paid for the concert tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of tickets that received a discount.\n2. Determine the discount amount per ticket.\n3. Calculate the total discount.\n4. Subtract the total discount from the original cost of the tickets.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets. The discount applies to every ticket bought that exceeds 10. Therefore, the number of tickets that received a discount is:\n   \\[\n   12 - 10 = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. The discount per ticket is 5% of the original price of $40. So, the discount per ticket is:\n   \\[\n   0.05 \\times 40 = 2\n   \\]\n\n3. Since 2 tickets received a discount, the total discount is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. The original cost of 12 tickets is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 40 = 480\n   \\]\n   After applying the total discount, the total amount Mr. Benson paid is:\n   \\[\n   480 - 4 = 476\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Mr. Benson paid is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{476}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total amount Mr. Benson paid for the concert tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets.\n2. Calculate the cost of the remaining 2 tickets with the discount applied.\n3. Add the two amounts together to get the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ tickets} \\times \\$40 \\text{ per ticket} = \\$400 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the remaining 2 tickets with the 5% discount applied.
