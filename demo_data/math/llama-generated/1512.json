Determine the number of groups of 10 seats and the number of additional seats.\n3. Calculate the cost for the groups of 10 seats after the discount.\n4. Calculate the cost for the additional seats.\n5. Add the costs from steps 3 and 4 to get the total cost.\n\nLet's start with step 1. The school is adding 5 rows of seats, and each row has 8 seats:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ rows} \\times 8 \\text{ seats/row} = 40 \\text{ seats} \\]\n\nNext, for step 2, we need to determine how many groups of 10 seats there are in 40 seats and how many additional seats there are. Since 40 divided by 10 is 4, there are 4 groups of 10 seats and 0 additional seats:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ seats} \\div 10 = 4 \\text{ groups} \\]\n\\[ 40 \\text{ seats} - (4 \\text{ groups} \\times 10 \\text{ seats/group}) = 0 \\text{ additional seats} \\]\n\nFor step 3, we calculate the cost for the groups of 10 seats after the discount. Each group of 10 seats originally costs \\(10 \\text{ seats} \\times \\$30/\\text{seat} = \\$300\\). With a 10% discount, the cost per group is:\n\\[ \\$300 - (0.10 \\times \\$300) = \\$300 - \\$30 = \\$270 \\]\nSince there are 4 groups, the total cost for the groups of 10 seats is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ groups} \\times \\$270/\\text{group} = \\$1080 \\]\n\nFor step 4, we calculate the cost for the additional seats. Since there are 0 additional seats, the cost for the additional seats is:\n\\[ 0 \\text{ seats} \\times \\$30/\\text{seat} = \\$0 \\]\n\nFinally, for step 5, we add the costs from steps 3 and 4 to get the total cost:\n\\[ \\$1080 + \\$0 = \\$1080 \\]\n\nTherefore, the school will pay \\(\\boxed{1080}\\) dollars for the new seats.",
