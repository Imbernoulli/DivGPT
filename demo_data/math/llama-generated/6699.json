        "To determine the total amount of gas Dream's car will consume over the two days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of gas consumed today.\n2. Calculate the amount of gas consumed tomorrow.\n3. Add the gas consumed today to the gas consumed tomorrow.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount of gas consumed today.**\n\nDream drives 400 miles today. Since the car consumes 4 gallons of gas per mile, we can calculate the gas consumption for today as follows:\n\\[\n400 \\text{ miles} \\times 4 \\text{ gallons/mile} = 1600 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the amount of gas consumed tomorrow.**\n\nDream drives 200 more miles tomorrow than she does today. Therefore, the total distance driven tomorrow is:\n\\[\n400 \\text{ miles} + 200 \\text{ miles} = 600 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\nSince the car consumes 4 gallons of gas per mile, we can calculate the gas consumption for tomorrow as follows:\n\\[\n600 \\text{ miles} \\times 4 \\text{ gallons/mile} = 2400 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the gas consumed today to the gas consumed tomorrow.**\n\nTo find the total gas consumption over the two days, we add the gas consumed today to the gas consumed tomorrow:\n\\[\n1600 \\text{ gallons} + 2400 \\text{ gallons} = 4000 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of gas the car will consume is \\boxed{4000} gallons.",
        "To determine the total amount of gas Dream's car will consume over the two days, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the gas consumption for each day separately.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the gas consumption for today:\n- Dream drives 400 miles.\n- The car consumes 4 gallons of gas per mile.\n\\[\n\\text{Gas consumption for today} = 400 \\text{ miles} \\times 4 \\text{ gallons/mile} = 1600 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the gas consumption for tomorrow:\n- Dream drives 200 more miles than today.\n- Since she drove 400 miles today, she will drive:\n\\[\n400 \\text{ miles} + 200 \\text{ miles} = 600 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n- The car consumes 4 gallons of gas per mile.\n\\[\n\\text{Gas consumption for tomorrow} = 600 \\text{ miles} \\times 4 \\text{ gallons/mile} = 2400 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the gas consumption for today and tomorrow to find the total gas consumption over the two days:\n\\[\n\\text{Total gas consumption} = 1600 \\text{ gallons} + 2400 \\text{ gallons} = 4000 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of gas the car will consume is \\(\\boxed{4000}\\) gallons.",
