        "To determine how many items Carla needs to collect each day, we start by finding the total number of items she needs to collect. Carla needs to collect 30 leaves and 20 bugs, so the total number of items is:\n\n\\[ 30 + 20 = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we need to divide this total number of items by the number of days she has to complete the task, which is 10 days.
