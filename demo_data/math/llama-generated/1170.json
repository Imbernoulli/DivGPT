        "To determine the number of adults on the bus, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of children on the bus.\n2. Subtract the number of children from the total number of passengers to find the number of adults.\n\nFirst, we know that children make up 25% of the bus riders. The total number of passengers on the bus is 60. Therefore, the number of children can be calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of children} = 25\\% \\times 60 = 0.25 \\times 60 = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of children from the total number of passengers to find the number of adults:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of adults} = 60 - 15 = 45\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of adults on the bus is \\boxed{45}.",

So, we calculate the number of children as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of children} = 60 \\times \\frac{25}{100} = 60 \\times 0.25 = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of children from the total number of passengers to find the number of adults:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of adults} = 60 - 15 = 45\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of adults on the bus is \\boxed{45}.",

The total number of passengers on the bus is 60. Therefore, we can calculate the number of children by finding 25% of 60.\n\nFirst, we convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing 25 by 100:\n\\[ 25\\% = \\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply the total number of passengers by this decimal to find the number of children:\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 60 = 15 \\]\n\nSo, there are 15 children on the bus. To find the number of adults, we subtract the number of children from the total number of passengers:\n\\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of adults on the bus is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
