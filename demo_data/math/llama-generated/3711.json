        "To determine how far the jet could fly in 10 hours, we first need to find the jet's speed in miles per hour. The jet travels 580 miles in 2 hours, so we can calculate the speed as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{580 \\text{ miles}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 290 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the speed to find out how far the jet could fly in 10 hours.
