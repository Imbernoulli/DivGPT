        "To determine how many classes Maddy needs to take per semester, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of classes Maddy needs to graduate:**\n   Maddy needs 120 credits to graduate, and each class is worth 3 credits. Therefore, the total number of classes she needs is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120 \\text{ credits}}{3 \\text{ credits per class}} = 40 \\text{ classes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of classes Maddy needs to take per semester:**\n   Maddy is in college for 8 semesters. To find out how many classes she needs to take each semester, we divide the total number of classes by the number of semesters:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40 \\text{ classes}}{8 \\text{ semesters}} = 5 \\text{ classes per semester}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Maddy needs to take \\boxed{5} classes per semester.",
