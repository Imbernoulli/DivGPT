        "To determine how much Jordyn would pay for buying 50 bags of cherries and 50 bags of olives with a 10% discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the cherries.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the olives.\n3. Add the total costs of the cherries and olives to get the subtotal.\n4. Apply the 10% discount to the subtotal.\n5. Calculate the final amount Jordyn would pay.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. The price of one bag of cherries is $5. Therefore, the total cost for 50 bags of cherries is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\times 5 = 250 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. The price of one bag of olives is $7. Therefore, the total cost for 50 bags of olives is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\times 7 = 350 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. The subtotal for the cost of 50 bags of cherries and 50 bags of olives is:\n   \\[\n   250 + 350 = 600 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. A 10% discount on the subtotal is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   10\\% \\text{ of } 600 = 0.10 \\times 600 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. The final amount Jordyn would pay after the discount is:\n   \\[\n   600 - 60 = 540 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final amount Jordyn would pay is \\(\\boxed{540}\\).",

Apply the 10% discount to the subtotal to find the final cost.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The price of one bag of cherries is $5. Therefore, the cost for 50 bags of cherries is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\times 5 = 250 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. The price of one bag of olives is $7. Therefore, the cost for 50 bags of olives is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\times 7 = 350 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. Add the total costs of the cherries and olives to find the subtotal:\n   \\[\n   250 + 350 = 600 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. Apply the 10% discount to the subtotal. A 10% discount means Jordyn pays 90% of the subtotal. So, we calculate 90% of $600:\n   \\[\n   600 \\times 0.90 = 540 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final amount Jordyn would pay is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{540}\n\\]",
        "To determine how much Jordyn would pay for buying 50 bags of cherries and 50 bags of olives with a 10% discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.
