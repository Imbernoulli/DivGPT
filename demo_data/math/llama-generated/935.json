Add the base grounding period to the additional days.\n\nFirst, the base grounding period is given as 14 days.\n\nNext, we know that Cassidy got four grades below a B. Since she gets 3 extra days for each grade below a B, we calculate the additional days as follows:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ grades} \\times 3 \\text{ days/grade} = 12 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNow, we add the base grounding period to the additional days:\n\\[ 14 \\text{ days} + 12 \\text{ days} = 26 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, Cassidy is grounded for \\(\\boxed{26}\\) days.",
        "To determine how long Cassidy is grounded for, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the base grounding period, which is 14 days.\n2. Determine the additional days added for each grade below a B. The problem states that Cassidy gets an extra 3 days for each grade below a B.\n3. Calculate the total number of extra days by multiplying the number of grades below a B by the extra days per grade.\n4. Add the base grounding period to the total number of extra days to get the final grounding period.\n\nLet's go through the calculations step-by-step:\n\n1. The base grounding period is 14 days.\n2. Cassidy got four grades below a B, and each grade below a B adds 3 extra days. Therefore, the total number of extra days is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ grades} \\times 3 \\text{ days/grade} = 12 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n3.
