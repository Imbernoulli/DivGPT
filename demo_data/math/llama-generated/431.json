        "To find the age of the older friend, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables as follows:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the age of the older friend.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the age of the younger friend.\n\nWe are given two pieces of information:\n1. The difference between their ages is 2 years.\n2. The sum of their ages is 74 years.\n\nWe can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:\n1. \\( x - y = 2 \\)\n2. \\( x + y = 74 \\)\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can add the two equations together. This will eliminate the \\( y \\) variable:\n\\[\n(x - y) + (x + y) = 2 + 74\n\\]\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\\[\n2x = 76\n\\]\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{76}{2} = 38\n\\]\n\nSo, the age of the older friend is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).\n\nTo verify, we can find the age of the younger friend by substituting \\( x = 38 \\) back into one of the original equations. Using the second equation \\( x + y = 74 \\):\n\\[\n38 + y = 74\n\\]\nSubtracting 38 from both sides, we get:\n\\[\ny = 74 - 38 = 36\n\\]\n\nThe age of the younger friend is 36, which is 2 years less than the age of the older friend. The sum of their ages is \\( 38 + 36 = 74 \\), which matches the given information. Therefore, the solution is correct. The age of the older friend is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",
