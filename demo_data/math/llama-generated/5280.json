She goes out fishing today and catches twice as many fish as she caught in total in the past four months. If Erica trawled 80 kg of fish in the past four months, not including today, how much money will she have earned in the past four months including today (assuming she sells all her fish)?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Since she caught 80 kg of fish in the past four months, we can calculate the amount of fish she caught today as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 80 = 160 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the total amount of fish Erica caught over the past four months including today by adding the fish she caught today to the fish she caught in the past four months:\n\\[\n80 + 160 = 240 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total earnings from selling all the fish. Since she earns $20 per kg, we multiply the total amount of fish by the price per kg:\n\\[\n240 \\times 20 = 4800 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Erica will have earned in the past four months including today is \\(\\boxed{4800}\\).",
