        "To determine the total number of legos Bob needs to build a pyramid with 3 levels, where each level has one less lego per side than the level below it, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of legos in the bottom level.\n2. Calculate the number of legos in the second level.\n3. Calculate the number of legos in the top level.\n4. Sum the number of legos from all three levels.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of legos in the bottom level.**\nThe bottom level has 7 legos per side. Since it is a square, the total number of legos in the bottom level is:\n\\[ 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of legos in the second level.**\nThe second level has 6 legos per side. Since it is a square, the total number of legos in the second level is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of legos in the top level.**\nThe top level has 5 legos per side. Since it is a square, the total number of legos in the top level is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Sum the number of legos from all three levels.**\nThe total number of legos needed is the sum of the legos in the bottom level, the second level, and the top level:\n\\[ 49 + 36 + 25 = 110 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of legos Bob will need is:\n\\[ \\boxed{110} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of legos Bob will need to build a pyramid with 3 levels where each level has one less lego per side than the level below it, we need to calculate the number of legos in each level and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of legos in the bottom level. The bottom level has 7 legos per side, so it forms a square with 7 legos on each side. The number of legos in the bottom level is:\n\\[ 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of legos in the second level. The second level has 6 legos per side, so it forms a square with 6 legos on each side. The number of legos in the second level is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the number of legos in the top level. The top level has 5 legos per side, so it forms a square with 5 legos on each side.
