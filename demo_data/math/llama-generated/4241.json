        "To determine how many weeks it takes Steve to read a 2100-page book, we first need to calculate how many pages he reads in one week. Steve reads 100 pages on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Therefore, the total number of pages he reads in one week is:\n\n\\[ 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for Steve to read 2100 pages. We do this by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads in one week:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2100}{300} = 7 \\]\n\nSo, it takes Steve 7 weeks to read the entire book. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]",
        "To determine how many weeks it takes Steve to read the entire book, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he reads each week. Since he reads 100 pages on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, we can find the weekly total by multiplying the number of pages he reads each day by the number of days he reads in a week:\n\n\\[ 100 \\text{ pages/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days/week} = 300 \\text{ pages/week} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for Steve to read the entire book. The book is 2100 pages long, so we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads each week:\n\n\\[ 2100 \\text{ pages} \\div 300 \\text{ pages/week} = 7 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Steve \\(\\boxed{7}\\) weeks to read the book.",
