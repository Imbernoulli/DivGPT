        "To determine how many rabbits and weasels will be left after 3 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of each rodent caught by the foxes over the 3 weeks and then subtract that from the initial amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of weasels caught by the foxes in one week:\n- Each fox catches 4 weasels per week.\n- There are 3 foxes.\n- Therefore, the total number of weasels caught by the foxes in one week is \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) weasels.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of weasels caught by the foxes in 3 weeks:\n- The total number of weasels caught in one week is 12.\n- Therefore, the total number of weasels caught in 3 weeks is \\(12 \\times 3 = 36\\) weasels.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of rabbits caught by the foxes in one week:\n- Each fox catches 2 rabbits per week.\n- There are 3 foxes.\n- Therefore, the total number of rabbits caught by the foxes in one week is \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) rabbits.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of rabbits caught by the foxes in 3 weeks:\n- The total number of rabbits caught in one week is 6.\n- Therefore, the total number of rabbits caught in 3 weeks is \\(6 \\times 3 = 18\\) rabbits.\n\nNow, let's determine how many weasels and rabbits will be left after 3 weeks:\n- Initially, there are 100 weasels.\n- After 3 weeks, 36 weasels have been caught.\n- Therefore, the number of weasels left is \\(100 - 36 = 64\\).\n\n- Initially, there are 50 rabbits.\n- After 3 weeks, 18 rabbits have been caught.\n- Therefore, the number of rabbits left is \\(50 - 18 = 32\\).\n\nSo, the number of rabbits and weasels left after 3 weeks is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
