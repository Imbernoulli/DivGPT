        "To find the average page count per essay for the 15 students, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pages turned in by all the students.\n2. Divide the total number of pages by the number of students.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pages turned in by each group of students:\n- The first 5 students each turned in essays with 2 pages. So, the total number of pages for the first group is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 2 = 10\n  \\]\n- The next 5 students each turned in essays with 3 pages. So, the total number of pages for the second group is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 3 = 15\n  \\]\n- The last 5 students each turned in essays with 1 page. So, the total number of pages for the third group is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 1 = 5\n  \\]\n\nNext, we add up the pages from all three groups to get the total number of pages turned in by all the students:\n\\[\n10 + 15 + 5 = 30\n\\]\n\nNow, we divide the total number of pages by the number of students to find the average page count per essay:\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{15} = 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average page count per essay for the 15 students is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
