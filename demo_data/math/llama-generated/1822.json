Calculate the total number of washing machines removed from the shipping container.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of boxes in the shipping container:**\n   There are 10 crates, and each crate contains 6 boxes.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of boxes} = 10 \\times 6 = 60\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many washing machines were initially in each box:**\n   Each box contains 4 washing machines.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Washing machines per box} = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of washing machines initially in the shipping container:**\n   There are 60 boxes, and each box contains 4 washing machines.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of washing machines initially} = 60 \\times 4 = 240\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many washing machines were removed from each box:**\n   A worker removes 1 washing machine from each box.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Washing machines removed per box} = 1\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of washing machines removed from the shipping container:**\n   There are 60 boxes, and 1 washing machine is removed from each box.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of washing machines removed} = 60 \\times 1 = 60\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of washing machines removed from the shipping container is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of washing machines removed from the shipping container, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of boxes in the shipping container.\n2.
