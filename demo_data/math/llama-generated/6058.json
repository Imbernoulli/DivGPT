        "To determine the cost of John's order after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the 7 items before any discount.\n2. Determine the amount of the total cost that is over $1000.\n3. Calculate the discount amount.\n4. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final cost.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of each item is $200, and John buys 7 items.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 7 \\times 200 = 1400\n   \\]\n\n2. The total cost is $1400, which is $400 over $1000.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount over $1000} = 1400 - 1000 = 400\n   \\]\n\n3. The store gives a 10% discount on the amount over $1000.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount amount} = 0.10 \\times 400 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final cost.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final cost} = 1400 - 40 = 1360\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of John's order after the discount is \\(\\boxed{1360}\\).",

Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the 7 items:\n\\[\n7 \\times 200 = 1400\n\\]\nThe total cost of the items is $1400.\n\nNext, we need to find out if this total cost is over $1000 and, if so, calculate the discount. Since $1400 is greater than $1000, John qualifies for the 10% discount on the amount over $1000. The amount over $1000 is:\n\\[\n1400 - 1000 = 400\n\\]\nThe discount on this amount is:\n\\[\n10\\% \\text{ of } 400 = 0.10 \\times 400 = 40\n\\]\nSo, the discount is $40. We subtract this discount from the original total cost to get the final cost:\n\\[\n1400 - 40 = 1360\n\\]\nTherefore, the final cost of John's order after the discount is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1360}\n\\]",

Determine the amount of the total cost that is over $1000.\n3. Calculate the discount on the amount that is over $1000.\n4. Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost.\n\nLet's start with step 1:\n\nThe cost of each item is $200, and John buys 7 items.

Since the total cost is $1400, the amount over $1000 is:\n\\[ 1400 - 1000 = 400 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the discount on the amount that is over $1000. The discount is 10%, so we multiply $400 by 10% (or 0.10):\n\\[ 400 \\times 0.10 = 40 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost:\n\\[ 1400 - 40 = 1360 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of John's order after the discount is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1360} \\]",

        "To determine the cost of John's order after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the 7 items.\n2. Determine if the total cost is over $1000.\n3. Calculate the discount amount.\n4. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the 7 items:**\n   Each item costs $200, and John buys 7 items.\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 200 = 1400\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the items is $1400.\n\n2. **Determine if the total cost is over $1000:**\n   Since $1400 is greater than $1000, John qualifies for the discount.\n\n3. **Calculate the discount amount:**\n   The store gives a 10% discount on the amount of the sell that was over $1000.\n   First, find the amount over $1000:\n   \\[\n   1400 - 1000 = 400\n   \\]\n   Now, calculate 10% of $400:\n   \\[\n   0.10 \\times 400 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, the discount amount is $40.\n\n4. **Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:**\n   Subtract the $40 discount from the total cost of $1400:\n   \\[\n   1400 - 40 = 1360\n   \\]\n   So, the final cost of John's order after the discount is \\boxed{1360}.",
        "To determine the final cost of John's order after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:**\n   John buys 7 items, and each item costs $200.\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 200 = 1400\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost before the discount is $1400.\n\n2. **Determine the amount of the total cost that is over $1000:**\n   The total cost is $1400, and the store only gives a discount on the amount over $1000.\n   \\[\n   1400 - 1000 = 400\n   \\]\n   So, the amount over $1000 is $400.\n\n3. **Calculate the discount amount:**\n   The store gives a 10% discount on the amount over $1000.\n   \\[\n   10\\% \\text{ of } 400 = 0.10 \\times 400 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, the discount amount is $40.\n\n4. **Subtract the discount amount from the total cost:**\n   To find the final cost after the discount, subtract the discount amount from the original total cost.\n   \\[\n   1400 - 40 = 1360\n   \\]\n   So, the final cost of John's order after the discount is \\(\\boxed{1360}\\).",
