        "To determine what percent of the total cost is the ham and bread, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of all the items.\n2. Calculate the combined cost of the ham and bread.\n3. Determine the percentage of the total cost that the ham and bread represent.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of all the items:\n\\[\n50 + 150 + 200 = 400\n\\]\nSo, the total cost is $400.\n\nNext, let's calculate the combined cost of the ham and bread:\n\\[\n50 + 150 = 200\n\\]\nSo, the combined cost of the ham and bread is $200.\n\nNow, we need to determine what percent $200 is of $400. We do this by dividing the combined cost of the ham and bread by the total cost and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{200}{400} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.5 \\times 100 = 50\n\\]\nSo, the ham and bread represent 50% of the total cost.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]",

Determine the percentage of the total cost that the ham and bread represent.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of all the items.**\n\nThe cost of the bread is $50.\nThe cost of the ham is $150.\nThe cost of the cake is $200.\n\nSo, the total cost is:\n\\[ 50 + 150 + 200 = 400 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the combined cost of the ham and bread.**\n\nThe cost of the ham is $150.\nThe cost of the bread is $50.\n\nSo, the combined cost of the ham and bread is:\n\\[ 150 + 50 = 200 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the percentage of the total cost that the ham and bread represent.**\n\nTo find the percentage, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Part}}{\\text{Whole}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nHere, the \"Part\" is the combined cost of the ham and bread, which is $200, and the \"Whole\" is the total cost, which is $400. So, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{200}{400} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.5 \\times 100 = 50\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percent of the cost that the ham and bread represent is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",
