        "To find the total area of the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made, we start by calculating the area of one triangular house. The formula for the area of a triangle is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n\nFor Zion's triangular house, the base is 40 cm and the height is 20 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of Zion's house} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 \\times 20 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 800 = 400 \\text{ square centimeters}\n\\]\n\nSince Zion and his two friends each built a triangular house that is similar to Zion's house, each of their houses also has an area of 400 square centimeters. Therefore, the total area of the three houses is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total area} = 400 + 400 + 400 = 1200 \\text{ square centimeters}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total area of the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1200}\n\\]",

Since Zion and his two friends each built a house, there are a total of 3 houses. Therefore, we multiply the area of one house by 3:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Area} = 400 \\times 3 = 1200\n\\]\n\nThus, the total area of the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made is \\(\\boxed{1200}\\) square centimeters.",
