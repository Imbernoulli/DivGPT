        "To determine how long Bill spent working on the project, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of time Bill spent napping over the four days.\n2. Determine the total number of hours in the four days.\n3. Subtract the total nap time from the total time in the four days to find the time spent working.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total nap time. Bill took 6 naps, each lasting 7 hours:\n\\[ 6 \\times 7 = 42 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, let's determine the total number of hours in the four days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 24 by 4:\n\\[ 24 \\times 4 = 96 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total nap time from the total time in the four days to find the time spent working:\n\\[ 96 - 42 = 54 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the time Bill spent working on the project is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
