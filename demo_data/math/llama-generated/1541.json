        "To determine how many more sit-ups Bob can do compared to Ken, we start by calculating the number of sit-ups each person can do.\n\nFirst, we know that Ken can do 20 sit-ups. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Ken's sit-ups} = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Nathan can do twice as many sit-ups as Ken. So, we calculate Nathan's sit-ups as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Nathan's sit-ups} = 2 \\times \\text{Ken's sit-ups} = 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many sit-ups Bob can do. Bob can do half the number of sit-ups that Ken and Nathan combined can do. First, we calculate the combined number of sit-ups for Ken and Nathan:\n\\[ \\text{Combined sit-ups of Ken and Nathan} = \\text{Ken's sit-ups} + \\text{Nathan's sit-ups} = 20 + 40 = 60 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate Bob's sit-ups as half of this combined total:\n\\[ \\text{Bob's sit-ups} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Combined sit-ups of Ken and Nathan} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 = 30 \\]\n\nFinally, we need to find out how many more sit-ups Bob can do compared to Ken. We do this by subtracting the number of sit-ups Ken can do from the number of sit-ups Bob can do:\n\\[ \\text{Difference in sit-ups} = \\text{Bob's sit-ups} - \\text{Ken's sit-ups} = 30 - 20 = 10 \\]\n\nThus, Bob can do \\(\\boxed{10}\\) more sit-ups compared to Ken.",

Calculate the combined number of sit-ups Ken and Nathan can do.\n3. Calculate the number of sit-ups Bob can do.\n4. Determine the difference between the number of sit-ups Bob can do and the number of sit-ups Ken can do.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Nathan can do twice as many sit-ups as Ken. Since Ken can do 20 sit-ups, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Nathan's sit-ups} = 2 \\times 20 = 40\n   \\]\n\n2. The combined number of sit-ups Ken and Nathan can do is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined sit-ups} = 20 + 40 = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. Bob can do half the number of sit-ups that Ken and Nathan combined can do. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bob's sit-ups} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. The difference between the number of sit-ups Bob can do and the number of sit-ups Ken can do is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 30 - 20 = 10\n   \\]\n\nThus, Bob can do \\(\\boxed{10}\\) more sit-ups compared to Ken.",
        "To determine how many more sit-ups Bob can do compared to Ken, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many sit-ups Nathan can do.\n2. Calculate the total number of sit-ups Ken and Nathan can do together.\n3. Determine how many sit-ups Bob can do.\n4. Find the difference between the number of sit-ups Bob can do and the number of sit-ups Ken can do.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Ken can do 20 sit-ups. Nathan can do twice as many sit-ups as Ken. Therefore, Nathan can do:\n\\[ 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ sit-ups} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of sit-ups Ken and Nathan can do together:\n\\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \\text{ sit-ups} \\]\n\nBob can do half the number of sit-ups that Ken and Nathan can do together. Therefore, Bob can do:\n\\[ \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\text{ sit-ups} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of sit-ups Bob can do and the number of sit-ups Ken can do:\n\\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \\text{ sit-ups} \\]\n\nSo, Bob can do \\(\\boxed{10}\\) more sit-ups compared to Ken."
