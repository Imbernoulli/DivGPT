        "To determine how many green leaves are left on the tea leaf plants, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of green leaves on all three tea leaf plants initially.\n2. Determine how many leaves turn yellow and fall off from each plant.\n3. Calculate the number of green leaves left on each plant.\n4. Sum the green leaves left on all three plants.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Each tea leaf plant has 18 green leaves. Since there are 3 plants, the total number of green leaves initially is:\n   \\[\n   18 \\times 3 = 54\n   \\]\n\n2. One-third of the leaves turn yellow and fall off from each plant. Therefore, the number of leaves that fall off from each plant is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the number of green leaves left on each plant is:\n   \\[\n   18 - 6 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. Since there are 3 plants, the total number of green leaves left on all three plants is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 3 = 36\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of green leaves left on the tea leaf plants is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
        "To determine how many green leaves are left on the tea leaf plants, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of green leaves on all three tea leaf plants.\n2. Determine how many leaves turn yellow and fall off from each plant.\n3. Calculate the number of green leaves remaining on each plant.\n4. Sum the remaining green leaves from all three plants.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of green leaves on all three tea leaf plants:\n\\[\n18 \\text{ leaves/plant} \\times 3 \\text{ plants} = 54 \\text{ leaves}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many leaves turn yellow and fall off from each plant. Since one-third of the leaves on each plant turn yellow and fall off, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 18 \\text{ leaves/plant} = 6 \\text{ leaves/plant}\n\\]\nSo, 6 leaves fall off from each plant. Therefore, the number of green leaves remaining on each plant is:\n\\[\n18 \\text{ leaves/plant} - 6 \\text{ leaves/plant} = 12 \\text{ leaves/plant}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the remaining green leaves from all three plants:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ leaves/plant} \\times 3 \\text{ plants} = 36 \\text{ leaves}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of green leaves left on the tea leaf plants is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]",

Each tea leaf plant has 18 green leaves, and there are 3 plants.\n   \\[\n   18 \\times 3 = 54\n   \\]\n   So, initially, there are 54 green leaves on all three plants.\n\n2. One-third of the leaves on each plant turn yellow and fall off. Therefore, we need to find one-third of 18 for each plant.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, 6 leaves turn yellow and fall off from each plant.\n\n3. Subtract the number of leaves that fall off from each plant from the initial number of leaves on each plant.\n   \\[\n   18 - 6 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, there are 12 green leaves left on each plant.\n\n4. Since there are 3 plants, we multiply the number of green leaves left on each plant by 3.\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 3 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, the total number of green leaves left on all three plants is 36.\n\nTherefore, the number of green leaves left on the tea leaf plants is \\boxed{36}.",
