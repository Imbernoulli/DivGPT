        "To determine how long it will take for Jim to catch Bob, we need to analyze their relative speed and the head start Bob has.\n\nFirst, we calculate the relative speed between Jim and Bob. Jim runs at 9 miles per hour, and Bob runs at 6 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:\n\\[\n9 \\text{ miles per hour} - 6 \\text{ miles per hour} = 3 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\nThis means Jim is gaining 3 miles every hour on Bob.\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take for Jim to cover the 1-mile head start that Bob has. Since Jim is gaining 3 miles per hour, we can set up the following equation to find the time \\( t \\) (in hours) it takes for Jim to catch Bob:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times t = 1 \\text{ mile}\n\\]\nSolving for \\( t \\), we get:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{3 \\text{ miles per hour}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSince we need the answer in minutes, we convert \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jim \\(\\boxed{20}\\) minutes to catch Bob.",
        "To determine how long it will take for Jim to catch Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Jim to make up Bob's 1-mile head start. We can do this by finding the relative speed between Jim and Bob and then using that to calculate the time.\n\n1. Calculate the relative speed between Jim and Bob:\n   Jim's speed is 9 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 6 miles per hour. Therefore, the relative speed is:\n   \\[\n   9 - 6 = 3 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n   This means Jim isWith Bob at a rate of 3 miles per hour.\n\n2.

Since Bob has a 1 mile head start, the distance Jim runs will be 1 mile more than the distance Bob runs when Jim catches him.

To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jim \\(\\boxed{20}\\) minutes to catch Bob.",

        "To determine how many minutes it will take for Jim to catch up to Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Jim to make up Bob's 1-mile head start. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Calculate the relative speed between Jim and Bob:**\n   Jim runs at 9 miles per hour, and Bob runs at 6 miles per hour. The relative speed is the difference between their speeds:\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ miles per hour} - 6 \\text{ miles per hour} = 3 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n   This means that Jim is gaining on Bob at a rate of 3 miles per hour.\n\n2. **Determine the time it takes for Jim to make up the 1-mile head start:**\n   Since Jim is gaining on Bob at a rate of 3 miles per hour, we need to find out how long it will take him to cover the 1-mile head start. We do this by dividing the head start distance by the relative speed:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{3 \\text{ miles per hour}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the time from hours to minutes:**\n   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jim \\(\\boxed{20}\\) minutes to catch up to Bob.",

Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Determine the speed difference**: Jim runs 9 miles per hour, and Bob runs 6 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:\n   \\[\n   9 - 6 = 3 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n   This means Jim is closing the gap at a rate of 3 miles per hour.\n\n2. **Calculate the time to close the gap**: Bob has a 1 mile head start. To find out how long it takes Jim to close this 1 mile gap, we divide the distance by the speed difference:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{3 \\text{ miles per hour}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the time to minutes**: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jim \\(\\boxed{20}\\) minutes to catch Bob.",
        "To determine how many minutes it will take for Jim to catch up to Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Jim to cover the distance Bob has already run plus the distance Bob continues to run while Jim is catching up.\n\n1. **Calculate the head start distance:**\n   Bob has a 1 mile head start.\n\n2. **Determine the relative speed:**\n   Jim runs at 9 miles per hour, and Bob runs at 6 miles per hour. The relative speed at which Jim is catching up to Bob is the difference in their speeds:\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ miles per hour} - 6 \\text{ miles per hour} = 3 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time to catch up:**\n   Jim needs to cover the 1 mile head start at a relative speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \\( t \\) it takes for Jim to catch up is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{\\text{head start distance}}{\\text{relative speed}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{3 \\text{ miles per hour}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert the time to minutes:**\n   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jim \\(\\boxed{20}\\) minutes to catch up to Bob.",

        "To determine how many minutes it will take for Jim to catch Bob, we need to set up an equation based on their speeds and the head start.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- \\( t \\) is the time in hours it takes for Jim to catch Bob.\n\nBob's speed is 6 miles per hour, and he has a 1-mile head start.
