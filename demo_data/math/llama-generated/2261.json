        "First, we calculate the number of students who like the color blue. Since 30% of the 200 students like the color blue, we have:\n\n\\[\n0.30 \\times 200 = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, 60 students like the color blue. Next, we determine the number of students who do not like the color blue. This is the total number of students minus the number of students who like the color blue:\n\n\\[\n200 - 60 = 140\n\\]\n\nAmong the 140 students who do not like the color blue, 40% like the color red. Therefore, the number of students who like the color red is:\n\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 140 = 56\n\\]\n\nThe rest of the students who do not like the color blue like the color yellow. To find the number of students who like the color yellow, we subtract the number of students who like the color red from the total number of students who do not like the color blue:\n\n\\[\n140 - 56 = 84\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the combined number of students who like the color yellow and the color blue. We add the number of students who like the color blue to the number of students who like the color yellow:\n\n\\[\n60 + 84 = 144\n\\]\n\nThus, the combined number of students who like the color yellow and the color blue is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{144}\n\\]",
