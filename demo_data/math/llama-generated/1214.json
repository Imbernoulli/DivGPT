        "To determine how many striped jerseys Justin bought, we start by calculating the total cost of the long-sleeved jerseys. Justin bought four long-sleeved jerseys, each costing $15. Therefore, the total cost for the long-sleeved jerseys is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 15 = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the cost of the long-sleeved jerseys from the total amount Justin spent to find out how much he spent on the striped jerseys. Justin spent a total of $80, so the amount spent on the striped jerseys is:\n\n\\[ 80 - 60 = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nEach striped jersey costs $10, so the number of striped jerseys Justin bought is:\n\n\\[ 20 \\div 10 = 2 \\]\n\nThus, the number of striped jerseys Justin bought is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
