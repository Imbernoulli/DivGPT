The price of a phone, which was $400, also increased by 40% from its original price. If Bethany had taken both items to the auction, calculate the total amount she received for the items after the sale at the auction.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The increase in price is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times 500 = \\frac{2 \\times 500}{5} = \\frac{1000}{5} = 200\n\\]\nTherefore, the new price of the TV is:\n\\[\n500 + 200 = 700\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the new price of the phone. The initial price of the phone is $400, and it increased by 40% of its initial price.
