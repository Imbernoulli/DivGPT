        "To determine how many slices of pizza were left, we start by calculating how many slices were eaten. The pizza was cut into 16 slices and three-fourths of it was eaten. Therefore, we need to find three-fourths of 16:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 16 = 12\n\\]\n\nThis means that 12 slices of pizza were eaten. To find out how many slices were left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:\n\n\\[\n16 - 12 = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of slices of pizza left is \\boxed{4}.",
        "To determine how many slices of pizza were left after the family ate three-fourths of it, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten:**\n   The pizza is cut into 16 slices.

To find out how many slices this is, we multiply the total number of slices by three-fourths:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Slices eaten} = 16 \\times \\frac{3}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   To multiply 16 by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), we multiply 16 by 3 and then divide by 4:\n   \\[\n   16 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{16 \\times 3}{4} = \\frac{48}{4} = 12\n   \\]\n   So, the family ate 12 slices of pizza.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of slices left:**\n   To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Slices left} = 16 - 12 = 4\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of slices of pizza left is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

Therefore, we multiply the total number of slices by three-fourths:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Slices eaten} = 16 \\times \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication, we multiply 16 by 3 and then divide by 4:\n\n\\[\n16 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{16 \\times 3}{4} = \\frac{48}{4} = 12\n\\]\n\nSo, the family ate 12 slices of pizza. Next, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Slices left} = 16 - 12 = 4\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of slices of pizza left is \\boxed{4}.",
