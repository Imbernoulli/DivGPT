        "To determine how many days it will take for Andrew's family to finish the pack of 100 masks, we need to calculate the total number of masks used per day and then divide the total number of masks by this daily usage.\n\nFirst, let's find out the total number of people in Andrew's family. Andrew lives with his 2 parents and 2 siblings, so the total number of family members is:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \\]\n\nEach family member changes masks every 4 days, so each family member uses 1 mask every 4 days. Therefore, the total number of masks used by the family per day is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ people} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ mask}}{4 \\text{ days}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ masks}}{4 \\text{ days}} = 1.25 \\text{ masks per day} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many days it will take to use up 100 masks.

Andrew lives with his 2 parents and 2 siblings, so the total number of people is:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many masks each person uses per day. Since each person changes masks every 4 days, each person uses:\n\\[ \\frac{1 \\text{ mask}}{4 \\text{ days}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ masks per day} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of masks used by the family each day by multiplying the number of people by the number of masks each person uses per day:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ people} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ masks per day per person} = \\frac{5}{4} \\text{ masks per day} \\]\n\nTo find out how many days it will take to use all 100 masks, we divide the total number of masks by the number of masks used per day:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ masks} \\div \\frac{5}{4} \\text{ masks per day} = 100 \\text{ masks} \\times \\frac{4}{5} \\text{ days per mask} = 80 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take \\(\\boxed{80}\\) days to finish the pack of masks.",
