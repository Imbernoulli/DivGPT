        "To determine how much the person will have in the bank after two years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and then add it to the original amount deposited.\n\n1. Calculate the interest earned each year:\n   The interest rate is 7% of the original amount deposited. The original amount deposited is $5600.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interest per year} = 0.07 \\times 5600 = 392\n   \\]\n   So, the interest earned each year is $392.\n\n2. Calculate the total interest earned over two years:\n   Since the interest is earned each year and not compounded, the total interest earned over two years is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total interest} = 392 \\times 2 = 784\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the total amount in the bank after two years:\n   The total amount in the bank after two years is the original amount deposited plus the total interest earned.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount} = 5600 + 784 = 6384\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money the person will have in the bank after two years is \\(\\boxed{6384}\\).",
