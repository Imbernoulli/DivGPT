Calculate the total number of lemons produced by the entire grove in one year.\n4. Find the total number of lemons produced by the grove in 5 years.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of lemons produced by one specially engineered lemon tree in one year.**\n\nA normal lemon tree produces 60 lemons per year. Since Jim's trees produce 50% more lemons, we need to calculate 50% of 60 and add it to 60.\n\n\\[ 50\\% \\text{ of } 60 = 0.5 \\times 60 = 30 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Lemons per tree per year} = 60 + 30 = 90 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of trees in the grove.**\n\nThe grove is 50 trees by 30 trees.\n\\[ \\text{Total number of trees} = 50 \\times 30 = 1500 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of lemons produced by the entire grove in one year.**\n\nSince each tree produces 90 lemons per year, the total number of lemons produced by 1500 trees in one year is:\n\\[ \\text{Total lemons per year} = 1500 \\times 90 = 135000 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the total number of lemons produced by the grove in 5 years.**\n\nTo find the total number of lemons produced in 5 years, we multiply the annual production by 5.\n\\[ \\text{Total lemons in 5 years} = 135000 \\times 5 = 675000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of lemons Jim produces in 5 years is \\(\\boxed{675000}\\).",
