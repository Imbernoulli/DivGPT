        "To determine how much taller James's uncle is than James now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate James's initial height.\n2. Determine James's height after his growth spurt.\n3. Find the difference between James's uncle's height and James's new height.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate James's initial height.**\n\nJames is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) as tall as his uncle. Since his uncle is 72 inches tall, we can find James's initial height by multiplying 72 by \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{James's initial height} = 72 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 72 \\times 0.6667 = 48 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine James's height after his growth spurt.**\n\nJames gains 10 inches from his growth spurt. Therefore, his new height is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{James's new height} = 48 + 10 = 58 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between James's uncle's height and James's new height.**\n\nTo find out how much taller James's uncle is than James now, we subtract James's new height from his uncle's height:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 72 - 58 = 14 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThus, James's uncle is \\(\\boxed{14}\\) inches taller than James now.",
