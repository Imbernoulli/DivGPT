        "To determine how many oranges remain after Michaela and Cassandra have eaten until they are full, we start by calculating how many oranges each person needs.\n\nFirst, we know that Michaela needs 20 oranges to get full. Cassandra needs twice as many oranges as Michaela, so we calculate:\n\\[ 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\]\nTherefore, Cassandra needs 40 oranges to get full.\n\nNext, we add the number of oranges Michaela and Cassandra need to find the total number of oranges they consume together:\n\\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \\]\nSo, together they need 60 oranges.\n\n They picked 90 oranges from the farm. To find out how many oranges remain after they have eaten, we subtract the total number of oranges they consumed from the number of oranges they picked:\n\\[ 90 - 60 = 30 \\]\nTherefore, the number of oranges that remain is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

Cassandra needs twice as many oranges as Michaela. Therefore, we calculate the number of oranges Cassandra needs as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 20 = 40\n\\]\nSo, Cassandra needs 40 oranges.\n\nNext, we find the total number of oranges both Michaela and Cassandra need by adding the number of oranges each one needs:\n\\[\n20 + 40 = 60\n\\]\nSo, they need a total of 60 oranges.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of oranges they need from the number of oranges they picked:\n\\[\n90 - 60 = 30\n\\]\nSo, the number of oranges that remain after they have both eaten until they are full is \\boxed{30}.",
