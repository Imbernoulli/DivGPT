Calculate the total earnings for 5 days.\n5. Subtract the rent and the cost of ingredients from the total earnings.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The booth made $50 selling popcorn each day.\n\n2. The booth made three times as much selling cotton candy each day. Therefore, the daily earnings from cotton candy are:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 50 = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. The total daily earnings from both popcorn and cotton candy are:\n   \\[\n   50 + 150 = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. The total earnings for 5 days are:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 200 = 1000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. The booth has to pay $30 for rent and $75 for the cost of ingredients. The total cost is:\n   \\[\n   30 + 75 = 105 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. The earnings after paying the rent and the cost of ingredients are:\n   \\[\n   1000 - 105 = 895 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the booth earned \\(\\boxed{895}\\) dollars for 5 days after paying the rent and the cost of ingredients.",

Calculate the total earnings for 5 days.\n5. Subtract the rent and the cost of ingredients from the total earnings.\n\nLet's start with the daily earnings from selling popcorn. The booth made $50 each day selling popcorn.\n\nNext, we calculate the daily earnings from selling cotton candy. The booth made three times as much selling cotton candy as it did selling popcorn. Therefore, the daily earnings from cotton candy are:\n\\[ 3 \\times 50 = 150 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we determine the total daily earnings from both popcorn and cotton candy:\n\\[ 50 + 150 = 200 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total earnings for 5 days:\n\\[ 200 \\times 5 = 1000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the rent and the cost of ingredients from the total earnings. The rent is $30 and the cost of ingredients is $75, so the total cost is:\n\\[ 30 + 75 = 105 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe earnings after paying the rent and the cost of ingredients are:\n\\[ 1000 - 105 = 895 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the booth earned \\(\\boxed{895}\\) dollars for 5 days after paying the rent and the cost of ingredients.",
