        "To determine how late Ingrid was to the party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate how late Paul was:**\n   - Paul arrived at 8:25 a.m.\n   - The party started at 8:00 a.m.\n   - Paul was \\( 8:25 - 8:00 = 25 \\) minutes late.\n\n2. **Calculate how late Amoura was:**\n   - Amoura arrived 30 minutes later than Paul.\n   - Paul was 25 minutes late.\n   - Amoura was \\( 25 + 30 = 55 \\) minutes late.\n\n3. **Calculate how late Ingrid was:**\n   - Ingrid was three times later than Amoura.\n   - Amoura was 55 minutes late.\n   - Ingrid was \\( 3 \\times 55 = 165 \\) minutes late.\n\nThus, Ingrid was \\(\\boxed{165}\\) minutes late to the party.",
        "To determine how late Ingrid was to the party, we need to calculate the arrival times of each person step by step.\n\n1. **Paul's Arrival Time:**\n   - The party started at 8:00 a.m.\n   - Paul arrived at 8:25 a.m.\n   - Paul was \\( 25 \\) minutes late.\n\n2. **Amoura's Arrival Time:**\n   - Amoura arrived 30 minutes later than Paul.\n   - Paul arrived at 8:25 a.m.\n   - Adding 30 minutes to 8:25 a.m.:\n     \\[\n     8:25 + 0:30 = 8:55\n     \\]\n   - Amoura was \\( 55 - 0 = 55 \\) minutes late.\n\n3. **Ingrid's Arrival Time:**\n   - Ingrid was three times later than Amoura.\n   - Amoura was 55 minutes late.\n   - Multiplying 55 minutes by 3:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 55 = 165\n     \\]\n   - Ingrid was \\( 165 \\) minutes late.\n\nThus, Ingrid was \\(\\boxed{165}\\) minutes late to the party.",
        "To determine how late Ingrid was to the party, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the arrival times step by step.\n\n1. **Paul's Arrival Time:**\n   Paul arrived at 8:25 a.m. This means he was 25 minutes late since the party started at 8:00 a.m.\n\n2. **Amoura's Arrival Time:**\n   Amoura arrived 30 minutes later than Paul.
