        "To determine how much money Scott made, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling both berry smoothies and cakes. We will do this step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the revenue from selling berry smoothies:\n   - Scott sold 40 cups of smoothies.\n   - Each cup of smoothie costs $3.\n   - Therefore, the total revenue from smoothies is \\( 40 \\text{ cups} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars per cup} = 120 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\n2. Calculate the revenue from selling cakes:\n   - Scott sold 18 cakes.\n   - Each cake costs $2.\n   - Therefore, the total revenue from cakes is \\( 18 \\text{ cakes} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per cake} = 36 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\n3. Add the revenue from smoothies and the revenue from cakes to find the total amount of money Scott made:\n   - Total revenue = Revenue from smoothies + Revenue from cakes\n   - Total revenue = \\( 120 \\text{ dollars} + 36 \\text{ dollars} = 156 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\nThus, the total amount of money Scott made is \\(\\boxed{156}\\).",
