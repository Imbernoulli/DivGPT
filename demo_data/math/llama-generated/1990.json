The broker's commission is 5% of the original purchase price. Therefore, the broker's commission is:\n\\[\n\\text{Broker's commission} = 5\\% \\times 80,000 = 0.05 \\times 80,000 = 4,000\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the broker's commission to the sale price before the commission to find the total selling price:\n\\[\n\\text{Total selling price} = 96,000 + 4,000 = 100,000\n\\]\n\nThus, the house sold for \\boxed{100000}.",

The broker's commission is 5% of the original purchase price.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Broker's commission} = 5\\% \\times 80,000 = 0.05 \\times 80,000 = 4,000\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the broker's commission to the selling price before the broker's commission to find the total selling price.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total selling price} = 96,000 + 4,000 = 100,000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the house sold for \\boxed{100000}.",
