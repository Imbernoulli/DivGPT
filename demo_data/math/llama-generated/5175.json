Walter has \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) times fewer bananas than Jefferson. This means Walter has \\(56 - \\frac{1}{4} \\times 56\\) bananas.\n\nFirst, calculate \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 56\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 56 = 14\n\\]\n\nSo, Walter has:\n\\[\n56 - 14 = 42\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Find the total number of bananas when Jefferson and Walter combine them.**\n\nJefferson has 56 bananas and Walter has 42 bananas. The total number of bananas is:\n\\[\n56 + 42 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Divide the total number of bananas by 2 to find out how many each person gets.**\n\nTo find out how many bananas each person gets, divide the total number of bananas by 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{98}{2} = 49\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Walter gets \\(\\boxed{49}\\) bananas.",
