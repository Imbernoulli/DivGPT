        "To determine how many cards are in each layer of Lloyd's house of cards, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cards Lloyd has.\n2.

        "To determine how many cards are in each layer of Lloyd's house of cards, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cards Lloyd has.\n2. Divide the total number of cards by the number of layers to find out how many cards are in each layer.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cards Lloyd has. He owns 16 decks of cards, and each deck contains 52 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards is:\n\\[\n16 \\times 52\n\\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication, we can break it down:\n\\[\n16 \\times 52 = 16 \\times (50 + 2) = (16 \\times 50) + (16 \\times 2) = 800 + 32 = 832\n\\]\n\nSo, Lloyd has a total of 832 cards.\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of cards by the number of layers to find out how many cards are in each layer. The house has 32 layers, so we divide 832 by 32:\n\\[\n832 \\div 32\n\\]\n\nTo perform the division, we can simplify it step by step:\n\\[\n832 \\div 32 = 26\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 26 cards in each layer.\n\nTherefore, the number of cards per layer is \\boxed{26}.",
