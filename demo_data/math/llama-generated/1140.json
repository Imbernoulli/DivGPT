        "To determine how many tattoos Adam has, we first need to find out how many tattoos Jason has. Jason has two tattoos on each of his arms and three tattoos on each of his legs. Since a person typically has two arms and two legs, we can calculate the total number of tattoos Jason has as follows:\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ tattoos/arm} \\times 2 \\text{ arms} + 3 \\text{ tattoos/leg} \\times 2 \\text{ legs} = 4 + 6 = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, Jason has 10 tattoos. According to the problem, Adam has three more than twice as many tattoos as Jason has. We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times \\text{number of tattoos Jason has} + 3\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the number of tattoos Jason has into the expression, we get:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 10 + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Adam has \\(\\boxed{23}\\) tattoos.",

Adam has three more than twice as many tattoos as Jason. We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\\[\n\\text{Adam's tattoos} = 2 \\times (\\text{Jason's tattoos}) + 3\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the total number of tattoos Jason has into the equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Adam's tattoos} = 2 \\times 10 + 3\n\\]\n\nCalculate the expression:\n\\[\n2 \\times 10 = 20\n\\]\n\\[\n20 + 3 = 23\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Adam has \\boxed{23} tattoos.",

Since a person typically has two arms and two legs, we can calculate the total number of tattoos Jason has as follows:\n\nTattoos on arms = 2 tattoos/arm * 2 arms = 4 tattoos\nTattoos on legs = 3 tattoos/leg * 2 legs = 6 tattoos\n\nAdding these together gives the total number of tattoos Jason has:\nTotal tattoos Jason has = 4 tattoos + 6 tattoos = 10 tattoos\n\nNext, we need to find out how many tattoos Adam has.
