        "To determine how many omelets each person gets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Pauly has:**\n   Pauly has three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, we can calculate the total number of eggs as follows:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 12 = 36 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many omelets Pauly can make:**\n   Each omelet requires 4 eggs. To find out how many omelets Pauly can make with 36 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per omelet:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9 \\text{ omelets}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how many omelets each person gets:**\n   There are 3 people in total, including Pauly. To find out how many omelets each person gets, we divide the total number of omelets by the number of people:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\text{ omelets per person}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each person gets \\boxed{3} omelets.",
