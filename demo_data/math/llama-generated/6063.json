Therefore, the time spent blow-drying is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Walking the dog:**\n   Marcus takes his dog for a walk along a 3-mile trail. He walks at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find the time spent walking, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{3 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 0.5 hours to minutes:\n   \\[\n   0.5 \\times 60 = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total time spent:**\n   We add up the time spent on each activity:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ minutes} + 10 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Marcus spends with his dog is \\(\\boxed{60}\\) minutes.",
        "To determine the total time Marcus spends with his dog, we need to add up the time he spends on each activity: giving the dog a bath, blow-drying her, and taking her for a walk.\n\n1. First, we calculate the time Marcus spends blow-drying his dog. Since he spends half as long blow-drying her as he does giving her a bath, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent blow-drying} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 \\text{ minutes} = 10 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we calculate the time Marcus spends taking his dog for a walk. Since he walks at a speed of 6 miles per hour and the trail is 3 miles long, we use the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent walking} = \\frac{3 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 0.5 hours to minutes:\n   \\[\n   0.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. Finally, we add up the time spent on all three activities:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time spent} = 20 \\text{ minutes} + 10 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Marcus spends with his dog is \\(\\boxed{60}\\) minutes."
