        "To determine how many students are still in the school, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the total number of students in the school, which is 1000.\n2. Calculate the number of students taken on the trip to the beach. Since half of the students were taken on the trip, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1000}{2} = 500\n   \\]\n   So, 500 students were taken on the trip, and 500 students remain in the school.\n3. Next, calculate the number of students sent home. Since half of the remaining students were sent home, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{500}{2} = 250\n   \\]\n   So, 250 students were sent home, and 250 students remain in the school.\n\nTherefore, the number of students still in the school is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",

Determine how many students are still in the school after some were sent home.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of students taken on the trip to the beach:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students taken on the trip} = \\frac{1000}{2} = 500\n\\]\n\nAfter the trip, the number of students remaining in the school is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students remaining} = 1000 - 500 = 500\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of students sent home. Half of the remaining students were sent home:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students sent home} = \\frac{500}{2} = 250\n\\]\n\nFinally, the number of students still in the school is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students still in the school} = 500 - 250 = 250\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students still in the school is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",
        "To determine how many students are still in the school, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the total number of students, which is 1000.\n2. Calculate the number of students taken on the trip to the beach. Since half of the students were taken on the trip, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1000}{2} = 500\n   \\]\n   So, 500 students were taken on the trip, leaving:\n   \\[\n   1000 - 500 = 500\n   \\]\n   students still in the school.\n3. Next, half of the remaining students were sent home. Since half of the remaining 500 students were sent home, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{500}{2} = 250\n   \\]\n   So, 250 students were sent home, leaving:\n   \\[\n   500 - 250 = 250\n   \\]\n   students still in the school.\n\nTherefore, the number of students still in the school is \\boxed{250}.",
