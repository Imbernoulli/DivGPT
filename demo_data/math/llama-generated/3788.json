The cost of the MRI is $1200.\n2. The doctor's examination time is 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The doctor charges $300 per hour, so the cost of the examination is:\n   \\[\n   0.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 300 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n3. There is also a $150 fee just for being seen.\n\nNow, let's add up all the costs:\n\\[\n1200 \\text{ dollars} + 150 \\text{ dollars} + 150 \\text{ dollars} = 1500 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nInsurance covers 80% of the total cost, so Tim pays 20% of the total cost. Therefore, the amount Tim pays is:\n\\[\n1500 \\text{ dollars} \\times (1 - 0.80) = 1500 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.20 = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo, the amount Tim paid is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
        "To determine how much Tim paid out of pocket after insurance coverage, we need to calculate the total cost of his medical expenses and then apply the insurance coverage.\n\nFirst, let's break down the costs:\n\n1. **MRI Cost**: The MRI costs $1200.\n2. **Doctor's Examination Cost**: The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the examination takes 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the examination is:\n   \\[\n   0.5 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$300 \\text{ per hour} = \\$150\n   \\]\n3. **Fee for Being开奖**: The fee for being seen is $150.\n\nNext, we sum up all these costs to find the total medical expenses:\n\\[\n\\$1200 \\text{ (MRI)} + \\$150 \\text{ (doctor's examination)} + \\$150 \\text{ (fee for being seen)} = \\$1500\n\\]\n\nInsurance covers 80% of the total cost. Therefore, the amount covered by insurance is:\n\\[\n0.80 \\times \\$1500 = \\$1200\n\\]\n\nTo find out how much Tim paid out of pocket, we subtract the insurance coverage from the total cost:\n\\[\n\\$1500 - \\$1200 = \\$300\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount Tim paid is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{300}\n\\]",
