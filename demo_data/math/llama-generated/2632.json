        "To determine the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period, we need to calculate the leak rate for each hole and then find the total amount of water leaked over the given time.\n\nFirst, let's find the leak rate for each hole:\n\n1. **Largest hole**: The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces per minute.\n\n2. **Medium-sized hole**: The medium-sized hole leaks at one-half the rate of the largest hole.
