        "To determine how many pages Rob read, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the actual time Rob spent reading.\n2. Determine how many pages he read in that time.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the actual time Rob spent reading.**\n\nRob planned to spend three hours reading, but he ended up spending only three-quarters of this time. First, we convert three hours into minutes:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} = 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we find three-quarters of 180 minutes:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} \\times 180 = \\frac{3 \\times 180}{4} = \\frac{540}{4} = 135 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, Rob spent 135 minutes reading.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many pages he read in that time.**\n\nRob reads a page every fifteen minutes. To find out how many pages he read in 135 minutes, we divide 135 by 15:\n\\[ \\frac{135}{15} = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, Rob read \\(\\boxed{9}\\) pages.",

Determine how many pages he read in that time.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the actual time Rob spent reading.**\n\nRob planned to spend 3 hours reading, but he only spent three-quarters of that time. First, we need to find out what three-quarters of 3 hours is. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equivalent to:\n\\[ 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate three-quarters of 180 minutes:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} \\times 180 = \\frac{3 \\times 180}{4} = \\frac{540}{4} = 135 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, Rob spent 135 minutes reading.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many pages he read in that time.**\n\nRob reads a page every 15 minutes.
