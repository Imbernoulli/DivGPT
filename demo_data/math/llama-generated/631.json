        "To determine the percentage of the total time Laura spent in the park, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time Laura spent in the park on all six trips.\n2. Calculate the total time Laura spent walking to and from the park on all six trips.\n3. Find the total time Laura spent on all six trips.\n4. Calculate the percentage of the total time that Laura spent in the park.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total time Laura spent in the park on all six trips.**\n\non each trip, Laura spent 2 hours in the park. Since she took six trips, we multiply the time spent on one trip by six:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours/trip} \\times 6 \\text{ trips} = 12 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total time Laura spent walking to and from the park on all six trips.**\n\non each trip, Laura spent 30 minutes walking to and from the park. Since she took six trips, we multiply the time spent on one trip by six:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes/trip} \\times 6 \\text{ trips} = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nWe need to convert 180 minutes into hours to be consistent with the time spent in the park. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 180 by 60:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the total time Laura spent on all six trips.**\n\nWe add the total time spent in the park to the total time spent walking:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ hours} + 3 \\text{ hours} = 15 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the total time that Laura spent in the park.**\n\nWe use the formula for percentage, which is:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Part}}{\\text{Whole}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\nHere, the part is the total time spent in the park (12 hours), and the whole is the total time spent on all six trips (15 hours):\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{12}{15} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right) \\times 100 = 80\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the total time Laura spent in the park is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",

Determine the percentage of the total time that was spent in the park.\n\nLet's start with the first step. On each trip, Laura spent 2 hours at the park and an additional 30 minutes walking to and from the park. Since 30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours, the total time spent on each trip is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} + 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 2.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total time Laura spent on all six trips:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ trips} \\times 2.5 \\text{ hours/trip} = 15 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total time Laura spent in the park over all six trips. Since she spent 2 hours in the park on each trip, the total time spent in the park is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ trips} \\times 2 \\text{ hours/trip} = 12 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we determine the percentage of the total time that was spent in the park. This is done by dividing the total time spent in the park by the total time spent on all trips and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{12 \\text{ hours}}{15 \\text{ hours}} \\right) \\times 100 = 80\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the total time Laura spent in the park is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
        "To determine the percentage of the total time Laura spent in the park, we need to calculate both the total time she spent in the park and the total time she spent on all her trips, including the time spent walking to and from the park.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Laura spent in the park over all six trips. Since she spent 2 hours at the park on each trip, we multiply 2 hours by 6:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ hours/trip} \\times 6 \\text{ trips} = 12 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time Laura spent walking to and from the park over all six trips.

Calculate the total time spent on all six trips.\n3. Calculate the total time spent in the park over all six trips.\n4. Determine the percentage of the total time that was spent in the park.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total time Laura spent on each trip.**\n\nOn each trip, Laura spent 2 hours at the park and an additional 30 minutes walking to and from the park. First, convert the walking time from minutes to hours:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes} = 0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, add the time spent at the park and the walking time:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} + 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 2.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on all six trips.**\n\nMultiply the time spent on each trip by the number of trips:\n\\[ 2.5 \\text{ hours/trip} \\times 6 \\text{ trips} = 15 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total time spent in the park over all six trips.**\n\nMultiply the time spent at the park on each trip by the number of trips:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours/trip} \\times 6 \\text{ trips} = 12 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the percentage of the total time that was spent in the park.**\n\nDivide the total time spent in the park by the total time spent on all six trips, and then multiply by 100 to convert the fraction to a percentage:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{12 \\text{ hours}}{15 \\text{ hours}} \\right) \\times 100 = 80\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the total time Laura spent in the park is \\(\\boxed{80}\\)."
