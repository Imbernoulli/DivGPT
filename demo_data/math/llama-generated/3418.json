        "To determine how many more rocks Albert collected than Joshua, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many rocks Jose collected.\n2. Find out how many rocks Albert collected.\n3. Calculate the difference between the number of rocks Albert collected and the number of rocks Joshua collected.\n\nFirst, we know that Joshua collected 80 rocks. Jose collected 14 fewer rocks than Joshua. Therefore, we can calculate the number of rocks Jose collected as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of rocks Jose collected} = 80 - 14 = 66\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Albert collected 20 more rocks than Jose. Therefore, we can calculate the number of rocks Albert collected as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of rocks Albert collected} = 66 + 20 = 86\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more rocks Albert collected than Joshua. We do this by subtracting the number of rocks Joshua collected from the number of rocks Albert collected:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 86 - 80 = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, Albert collected \\(\\boxed{6}\\) more rocks than Joshua.",

Calculate how many rocks Albert collected.\n3. Find the difference between the number of rocks Albert collected and the number of rocks Joshua collected.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many rocks Jose collected. Jose collected 14 fewer rocks than Joshua. Since Joshua collected 80 rocks, we can find the number of rocks Jose collected by subtracting 14 from 80:\n\\[\n80 - 14 = 66\n\\]\nSo, Jose collected 66 rocks.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many rocks Albert collected. Albert collected 20 more rocks than Jose. Since Jose collected 66 rocks, we can find the number of rocks Albert collected by adding 20 to 66:\n\\[\n66 + 20 = 86\n\\]\nSo, Albert collected 86 rocks.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more rocks Albert collected than Joshua.
