        "To determine how much money the class will have in 2 months, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the weekly contribution for the entire class:**\n   - Each student contributes $2 every Friday.\n   - There are 30 students.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly contribution} = 30 \\text{ students} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/student} = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of Fridays in 2 months:**\n   - On average, there are 4 weeks in a month.\n   - Therefore, in 2 months, there are:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ months} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 8 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total contribution over 2 months:**\n   - The class contributes $60 each week.\n   - Over 8 weeks, the total contribution is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total contribution} = 60 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 8 \\text{ weeks} = 480 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money the class will have in 2 months is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",

Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, there are \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) Fridays in 2 months.\n2. Determine the total contribution per student over these 8 Fridays. Since each student contributes $2 every Friday, each student will contribute \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) dollars in 2 months.\n3. Calculate the total contribution for all 30 students.
