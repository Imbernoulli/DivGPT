Therefore, the amount of money Sam has left is:\n\\[\n\\text{Money left} = 620 - 340 = 280 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThe amount of money Sam still needs to buy the video game console is:\n\\[\n\\text{Money needed} = 600 - 280 = 320 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine how many more hours Sam needs to work to earn the remaining amount.**\n\nSince Sam earns $20 per hour, the number of additional hours he needs to work is:\n\\[\n\\text{Additional hours needed} = \\frac{320}{20} = 16 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Sam needs to work \\boxed{16} more hours before he can buy the video game console.",
