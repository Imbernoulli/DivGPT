        "To determine how many cans of corn Beth bought, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's define the number of cans of corn Beth bought as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, Beth bought 15 more cans of peas than twice the number of cans of corn. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\\[ \\text{Number of cans of peas} = 2x + 15 \\]\n\nWe are also given that Beth bought 35 cans of peas. Therefore, we can substitute 35 for the number of cans of peas in the equation:\n\\[ 35 = 2x + 15 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve for \\( x \\). First, we isolate the term with \\( x \\) by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 35 - 15 = 2x \\]\n\\[ 20 = 2x \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ x = \\frac{20}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Beth bought \\(\\boxed{10}\\) cans of corn.",

Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on the given relationship:\n\\[ 35 = 2c + 15 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve this equation for \\( c \\). First, we isolate the term involving \\( c \\) by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 35 - 15 = 2c \\]\n\\[ 20 = 2c \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( c \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ c = \\frac{20}{2} \\]\n\\[ c = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the number of cans of corn Beth bought is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

Therefore, we can substitute 35 for the number of cans of peas in the equation:\n\\[ 35 = 2c + 15 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve for \\( c \\). First, we isolate the term with \\( c \\) by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 35 - 15 = 2c \\]\n\\[ 20 = 2c \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( c \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ c = \\frac{20}{2} \\]\n\\[ c = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the number of cans of corn Beth bought is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
