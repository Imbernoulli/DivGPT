        "To determine how many cows are not black, we start by calculating the number of black cows. According to the problem, 5 more than half the cows are black.\n\nFirst, we find half of the total number of cows:\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{2} = 9\n\\]\n\nNext, we add 5 to this number to find the number of black cows:\n\\[\n9 + 5 = 14\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of black cows from the total number of cows to find the number of cows that are not black:\n\\[\n18 - 14 = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of cows that are not black is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
        "To determine how many cows are not black, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate half the number of cows Sam has.\n2.

So, we add 5 to 9:\n   \\[\n   9 + 5 = 14\n   \\]\n   Therefore, there are 14 black cows.\n\n3. To find out how many cows are not black, we subtract the number of black cows from the total number of cows:\n   \\[\n   18 - 14 = 4\n   \\]\n\nSo, the number of cows that are not black is \\boxed{4}.",
