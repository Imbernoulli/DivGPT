        "To determine the total number of guests served, we need to calculate the number of each type of guest (adults, children, and seniors) and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we know the number of adults served is 58.\n\nNext, we are told that the number of children served is 35 fewer than the number of adults. Therefore, we can calculate the number of children as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of children} = 58 - 35 = 23\n\\]\n\nThen, we are told that the number of seniors served is twice the number of children. Therefore, we can calculate the number of seniors as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of seniors} = 2 \\times 23 = 46\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of adults, children, and seniors to find the total number of guests served:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of guests} = 58 + 23 + 46\n\\]\n\nAdding these together step by step, we get:\n\\[\n58 + 23 = 81\n\\]\n\\[\n81 + 46 = 127\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of guests served is \\(\\boxed{127}\\).",
