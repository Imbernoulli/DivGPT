        "To determine how many square inches of the shoebox are left uncovered, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the area of the bottom of the shoebox.\n2. Calculate the area of the square block.\n3. Subtract the area of the square block from the area of the bottom of the shoebox.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the bottom of the shoebox. The shoebox is 6 inches wide and 4 inches tall, so the area is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ inches} \\times 4 \\text{ inches} = 24 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the area of the square block. The square block is 4 inches per side, so the area is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ inches} \\times 4 \\text{ inches} = 16 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the area of the square block from the area of the bottom of the shoebox to find out how many square inches are left uncovered:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ square inches} - 16 \\text{ square inches} = 8 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of square inches of the box that are left uncovered is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",
        "To determine how many square inches of the shoebox are left uncovered, we need to calculate the area of the base of the shoebox and subtract the area of the square block from it.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the base of the shoebox. The base of the shoebox is a rectangle with a length of 6 inches and a width of 4 inches. The area \\(A_{\\text{base}}\\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{base}} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n\\]\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{base}} = 6 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 4 \\, \\text{inches} = 24 \\, \\text{square inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find the area of the square block. The square block has a side length of 4 inches. The area \\(A_{\\text{block}}\\) of a square is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{block}} = \\text{side length} \\times \\text{side length}\n\\]\nSubstituting the given value:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{block}} = 4 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 4 \\, \\text{inches} = 16 \\, \\text{square inches}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the area of the square block from the area of the base of the shoebox to find the area that is left uncovered:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{uncovered}} = A_{\\text{base}} - A_{\\text{block}} = 24 \\, \\text{square inches} - 16 \\, \\text{square inches} = 8 \\, \\text{square inches}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of square inches of the box that are left uncovered is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
