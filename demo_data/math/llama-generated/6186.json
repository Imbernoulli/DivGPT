        "To determine how many tomatoes Tedra has remaining after giving some away, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of tomatoes harvested on Thursday.\n2. Determine the amount of tomatoes harvested on Friday.\n3. Calculate the total amount of tomatoes harvested over the three days.\n4. Subtract the amount given away from the total harvested on Friday.\n\nFirst, we know that Tedra harvested 400 kg of tomatoes on Wednesday and half as much on Thursday. Therefore, the amount harvested on Thursday is:\n\\[\n\\frac{400}{2} = 200 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know the total amount of tomatoes harvested on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2000 kg. Let's denote the amount harvested on Friday as \\( F \\). Then we can write the equation:\n\\[\n400 + 200 + F = 2000\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\n600 + F = 2000\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( F \\), we subtract 600 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nF = 2000 - 600 = 1400 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nSo, Tedra harvested 1400 kg of tomatoes on Friday. If he gives away 700 kg of them, the amount of tomatoes remaining is:\n\\[\n1400 - 700 = 700 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of tomatoes remaining is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{700}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many tomatoes Tedra has remaining after giving some away, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of tomatoes harvested on Thursday:**\n   Tedra harvests 400 kg on Wednesday.

So, we subtract the amounts harvested on Wednesday and Thursday from the total:\n\\[ \\text{Tomatoes harvested on Friday} = 2000 \\text{ kg} - 400 \\text{ kg} - 200 \\text{ kg} = 1400 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nNow, we determine how many tomatoes remain after Tedra gives away 700 kg:\n\\[ \\text{Tomatoes remaining} = 1400 \\text{ kg} - 700 \\text{ kg} = 700 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of tomatoes remaining is \\(\\boxed{700}\\).",

Determine the amount of tomatoes harvested on Friday.\n3. Find out how many tomatoes Tedra has left after giving some away.\n\nFirst, we know that Tedra harvested 400 kg of tomatoes on Wednesday and half as much on Thursday.

We already know the amounts harvested on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\\[\n\\text{Tomatoes harvested on Friday} = 2000 \\text{ kg} - (400 \\text{ kg} + 200 \\text{ kg}) = 2000 \\text{ kg} - 600 \\text{ kg} = 1400 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out the total amount of tomatoes harvested on Friday after giving some away.**\n\nTedra gives away 700 kg of the tomatoes harvested on Friday.\n\\[\n\\text{Tomatoes remaining} = 1400 \\text{ kg} - 700 \\text{ kg} = 700 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of tomatoes remaining is \\boxed{700}.",

Determine the amount of tomatoes harvested on Friday.\n3. Calculate the remaining tomatoes after giving away 700 kg.\n\nFirst, we know that Tedra harvested 400 kg of tomatoes on Wednesday and half as much on Thursday. Therefore, the amount harvested on Thursday is:\n\\[\n\\frac{400}{2} = 200 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know the total amount of tomatoes harvested on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2000 kg. Let \\( F \\) be the amount of tomatoes harvested on Friday. Then we can write the equation:\n\\[\n400 + 200 + F = 2000\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\n600 + F = 2000\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( F \\), we subtract 600 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nF = 2000 - 600 = 1400 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nSo, Tedra harvested 1400 kg of tomatoes on Friday. If he gives away 700 kg of these tomatoes, the remaining amount is:\n\\[\n1400 - 700 = 700 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of tomatoes remaining is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{700}\n\\]",

Determine the amount of tomatoes harvested on Friday.\n3. Find out how many tomatoes are remaining after giving away 700 kg.\n\nFirst, we know that Tedra harvested 400 kg of tomatoes on Wednesday and half as much on Thursday. Therefore, the amount of tomatoes harvested on Thursday is:\n\\[\n\\frac{400}{2} = 200 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that the total amount of tomatoes harvested on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2000 kg. Let \\( F \\) represent the amount of tomatoes harvested on Friday. Then we can write the equation:\n\\[\n400 + 200 + F = 2000\n\\]\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\n600 + F = 2000\n\\]\nTo find \\( F \\), we subtract 600 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nF = 2000 - 600 = 1400 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that Tedra harvested 1400 kg of tomatoes on Friday.
