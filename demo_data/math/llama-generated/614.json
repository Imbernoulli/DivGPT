Add the discounted prices together to get the total bill.\n\nFirst, let's find the discounted price of Curtis's Salisbury Steak:\n- The original price of the Salisbury Steak is $16.00.\n- The discount is 50% off, so we calculate the discount amount as follows:\n  \\[\n  16.00 \\times 0.50 = 8.00\n  \\]\n- Subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:\n  \\[\n  16.00 - 8.00 = 8.00\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's find the discounted price of Rob's Chicken Fried Steak:\n- The original price of the Chicken Fried Steak is $18.00.\n- The discount is 50% off, so we calculate the discount amount as follows:\n  \\[\n  18.00 \\times 0.50 = 9.00\n  \\]\n- Subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:\n  \\[\n  18.00 - 9.00 = 9.00\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we add the discounted prices of both meals to get the total bill:\n\\[\n8.00 + 9.00 = 17.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of their bill is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",
