        "To determine the number of tripodasauruses in the flock, we need to consider the relationship between the number of heads and legs each tripodasaurus has. Each tripodasaurus has 1 head and 3 legs, so each tripodasaurus contributes a total of 4 heads and legs.\n\nLet's denote the number of tripodasauruses in the flock by \\( x \\). Since each tripodasaurus contributes 4 heads and legs, the total number of heads and legs in the flock is \\( 4x \\). According to the problem, the total number of heads and legs is 20. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 4x = 20 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{20}{4} = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the number of tripodasauruses in the flock is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
