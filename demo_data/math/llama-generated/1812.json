        "To determine the total number of job applications Carly has sent, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.\n\nFirst, we know that Carly sent 200 job applications to companies in her state. This is given directly in the problem.\n\nNext, we are told that she sent twice that number to companies in other states. Therefore, the number of job applications sent to companies in other states is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 200 = 400 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of job applications sent by adding the applications sent to companies in her state and the applications sent to companies in other states:\n\\[ 200 + 400 = 600 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of job applications Carly has sent so far is:\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of job applications Carly has sent, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of job applications sent to companies in other states.\n2. Add the number of job applications sent to companies in her state to the number sent to companies in other states.\n\nFirst, we know that Carly sent 200 job applications to companies in her state.
