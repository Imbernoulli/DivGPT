        "To determine the cost of James's new barbell, we start by calculating 30% of the cost of his old barbell, which is $250. We can find 30% of $250 by multiplying $250 by 0.30:\n\n\\[ 250 \\times 0.30 = 75 \\]\n\nThis means that the new barbell costs $75 more than the old barbell. To find the total cost of the new barbell, we add $75 to the original cost of $250:\n\n\\[ 250 + 75 = 325 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the new barbell is \\(\\boxed{325}\\).",

To find the total cost of the new barbell, we add this additional cost to the original price:\n\\[\n250 + 75 = 325\n\\]\nTherefore, the cost of the new barbell is \\(\\boxed{325}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of the new barbell, we start by calculating 30% of the cost of the old barbell, which is $250. We can find 30% of $250 by multiplying $250 by 0.30:\n\n\\[\n250 \\times 0.30 = 75\n\\]\n\nThis means that the new barbell costs $75 more than the old barbell. To find the total cost of the new barbell, we add $75 to the cost of the old barbell:\n\n\\[\n250 + 75 = 325\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the new barbell is \\(\\boxed{325}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of the new barbell, we need to calculate the 30% increase on the original cost of $250. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1.
