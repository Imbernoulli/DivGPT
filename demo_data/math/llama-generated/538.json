        "To determine how long it will take for Kayla to reach the minimum driving age of 18, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Kayla's current age.\n2. Calculate the difference between Kayla's current age and the minimum driving age.\n\nFirst, we find Kayla's current age. According to the problem, Kayla is currently half the age of her sister Kimiko. Since Kimiko is 26 years old, we calculate Kayla's age as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Kayla's age} = \\frac{26}{2} = 13\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the difference between Kayla's current age and the minimum driving age of 18:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 18 - 13 = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Kayla \\boxed{5} years to reach the minimum driving age.",

Therefore, we calculate Kayla's age as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Kayla's age} = \\frac{26}{2} = 13\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many years it will take for Kayla to reach 18 years old. We do this by subtracting Kayla's current age from the minimum driving age:\n\\[\n\\text{Years until Kayla is 18} = 18 - 13 = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, it will be \\boxed{5} years before Kayla can reach the minimum age of driving in her state.",
