        "To determine the size of the living room, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total area of the apartment:**\n   The apartment is 16 feet by 10 feet.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area} = 16 \\times 10 = 160 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Define the size of the smaller rooms:**\n   Let \\( x \\) be the area of each of the smaller rooms.\n\n3. **Determine the area of the living room:**\n   The living room is as big as 3 other rooms, so its area is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Living room area} = 3x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set up the equation for the total area:**\n   There are 6 rooms in total, with 5 smaller rooms and 1 living room.

There are 5 smaller rooms and 1 living room, so the total area of the apartment can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area} = 5x + 3x = 8x\n   \\]\n\n3. Set up the equation to find \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   8x = 160\n   \\]\n   Solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{160}{8} = 20\n   \\]\n\n4. The area of the living room is \\( 3x \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of the living room} = 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\, \\text{square feet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the size of the living room is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
        "To determine the size of the living room, we first need to calculate the total area of the apartment. The apartment is 16 feet by 10 feet, so the area is:\n\n\\[ 16 \\times 10 = 160 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nNext, we know that there are 6 rooms in total, and all the rooms are the same size except the living room, which is as big as 3 other rooms. Let's denote the area of each of the smaller rooms as \\( x \\). Since the living room is as big as 3 other rooms, the area of the living room is \\( 3x \\).\n\nThe total area of all the rooms can be expressed as the sum of the areas of the 5 smaller rooms and the living room:\n\n\\[ 5x + 3x = 8x \\]\n\nWe know that the total area of the apartment is 160 square feet, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 8x = 160 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{160}{8} = 20 \\]\n\nSo, the area of each smaller room is 20 square feet. Since the living room is as big as 3 other rooms, the area of the living room is:\n\n\\[ 3x = 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, the size of the living room is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",
        "To determine the size of the living room, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total area of the apartment:**\n   The apartment is 16 feet by 10 feet.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area} = 16 \\times 10 = 160 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Define the size of the smaller rooms:**\n   Let the area of each of the smaller rooms be \\( x \\) square feet.\n\n3. **Determine the total area of the smaller rooms:**\n   There are 5 smaller rooms.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area of smaller rooms} = 5x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the area of the living room:**\n   The living room is as big as 3 other rooms.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of the living room} = 3x\n   \\]\n\n5. **Set up the equation for the total area:**\n   The total area of the apartment is the sum of the areas of all the rooms.\n   \\[\n   5x + 3x = 160\n   \\]\n\n6. **Combine like terms:**\n   \\[\n   8x = 160\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{160}{8} = 20\n   \\]\n\n8. **Calculate the area of the living room:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of the living room} = 3x = 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the size of the living room is \\(\\boxed{60}\\) square feet.",
        "To determine the size of the living room, we first need to calculate the total area of the apartment and then figure out how the area is distributed among the rooms.\n\n1. **Calculate the total area of the apartment:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 16 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 10 \\, \\text{feet} = 160 \\, \\text{square feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of standard-sized rooms:**\n   Since there are 6 rooms in total and the living room is as big as 3 other rooms, we can consider the living room as equivalent to 3 standard-sized rooms. Therefore, the total number of standard-sized rooms is:\n   \\[\n   6 - 1 + 3 = 8 \\text{ standard-sized rooms}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of each standard-sized room:**\n   Since the total area is 160 square feet and it is equivalent to 8 standard-sized rooms, the area of each standard-sized room is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of each standard-sized room} = \\frac{\\text{Total area}}{\\text{Number of standard-sized rooms}} = \\frac{160 \\, \\text{square feet}}{4} = 20 \\, \\text{square feet}\n   \\**\n\n4. **Determine the area of the living room:**\n   Since the living room is equivalent to 3 standard-sized rooms, the area of the living room is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of the living room} = 3 \\times \\text{Area of each standard-sized room} = 3 \\times 40 \\,

Therefore, there are:\n   \\[\n   6 - 1 = 5 \\text{ smaller rooms}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set up the equation for the total area:**\n   The living room is 3 times the size of one smaller room, so its area is \\( 3x \\). The total area of all 6 rooms is the sum of the areas of the smaller rooms and the living room:\n   \\[\n   5x + 3x = 160\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   8x = 160\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 8:\n   \\[\n   x = 20\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the area of the living room:**\n   The living room is 3 times the size of one smaller room:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of the living room} = 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the size of the living room is \\(\\boxed{60}\\) square feet.",
        "To determine the size of the living room, we first need to calculate the total area of the apartment. The apartment is 16 feet by 10 feet, so the total area is:\n\n\\[ 16 \\times 10 = 160 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nNext, we need to understand the distribution of the rooms. There are 6 rooms in total, with the living room being as big as 3 other rooms. This means that if we let the area of each of the other rooms be \\( x \\) square feet, then the area of the living room is \\( 3x \\) square feet. The total area of all the rooms combined is the sum of the areas of the living room and the other 5 rooms:\n\n\\[ 3x + 5x = 8x \\]\n\nSince the total area of the apartment is 160 square feet, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 8x = 160 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{160}{8} = 20 \\]\n\nSo, the area of each of the other rooms is 20 square feet. Since the living room is as big as 3 other rooms, the area of the living room is:\n\n\\[ 3x = 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, the size of the living room is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",
