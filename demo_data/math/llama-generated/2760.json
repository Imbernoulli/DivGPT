When Mac trades nickels for quarters, he gives away 7 nickels for each quarter. Since he trades for 20 quarters, he gives away:\n\\[ 20 \\times 7 = 140 \\text{ nickels} \\]\nSince each nickel is worth $0.05$, the total value of the nickels he traded away is:\n\\[ 140 \\times 0.05 = 7 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the values of the dimes and nickels he traded away, the total value of the coins he traded away is:\n\\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince the total value of the quarters he received is $10$ dollars, the amount of money Mac lost is:\n\\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Mac lost is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]",
