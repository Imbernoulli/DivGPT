She makes a $50.00 payment.\n   \\[\n   150.00 - 50.00 = 100.00\n   \\]\n   So, the remaining balance after the payment is $100.00.\n\n2. **Determine if interest is applied:**\n   Tonya is charged 20% interest if she leaves any balance on her card at the end of the month. Since she has $100.00 remaining, interest will be applied.\n\n3. **Calculate the interest:**\n   The interest rate is 20%. We need to find 20% of the remaining balance.\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 100.00 = 20.00\n   \\]\n   So, the interest amount is $20.00.\n\n4. **Add the interest to the remaining balance:**\n   The new balance is the remaining balance plus the interest.\n   \\[\n   100.00 + 20.00 = 120.00\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Tonya's new balance on her credit card is \\(\\boxed{120.00}\\).",
        "To determine Tonya's new balance on her credit card after making a $50.00 payment and being charged 20% interest if she leaves a balance, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Balance**: Tonya starts with a balance of $150.00.\n2. **Payment Made**: Tonya makes a $50.00 payment.\n3. **Remaining Balance**: Subtract the payment from the initial balance.\n   \\[\n   150.00 - 50.00 = 100.00\n   \\]\n   So, after making the payment, Tonya has a remaining balance of $100.00.\n4. **Interest Charge**: Since Tonya leaves a balance at the end of the month, she is charged 20% interest on the remaining balance.\n   \\[\n   100.00 \\times 0.20 = 20.00\n   \\]\n   The interest charge is $20.00.\n5. **New Balance**: Add the interest charge to the remaining balance.\n   \\[\n   100.00 + 20.00 = 120.00\n   \\]\n   So, the new balance on Tonya's credit card is \\(\\boxed{120.00}\\)."
