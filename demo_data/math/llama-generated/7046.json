        "To determine how many more geese than ducks remain at the park, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial number of geese:**\n   - There are 25 mallard ducks.\n   - There are ten less than twice as many geese as ducks.\n   - Twice the number of ducks is \\( 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\).\n   - Therefore, the number of geese is \\( 50 - 10 = 40 \\).\n\n2. **Account for the arrival of new ducks:**\n   - A small flock of 4 ducks arrives.\n   - The total number of ducks now is \\( 25 + 4 = 29 \\).\n\n3. **Account for the departure of geese:**\n   - Five less than 15 geese leave the park.\n   - The number of geese leaving is \\( 15 - 5 = 10 \\).\n   - The total number of geese now is \\( 40 - 10 = 30 \\).\n\n4. **Determine the difference between the number of geese and ducks:**\n   - The number of geese is 30.\n   - The number of ducks is 29.\n   - The difference is \\( 30 - 29 = 1 \\).\n\nThus, there is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) more goose than duck remaining at the park.",
        "To determine how many more geese than ducks remain at the park, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial number of geese.\n2. Add the number of ducks that arrived.\n3. Subtract the number of geese that left.\n4. Find the difference between the number of geese and ducks remaining.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial number of geese. The problem states that there are ten less than twice as many geese as ducks. Since there are 25 ducks, we can find the number of geese as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 25 - 10 = 50 - 10 = 40 \\]\nSo, there are initially 40 geese.\n\nNext, a small flock of 4 ducks arrives at the park. Therefore, the total number of ducks now is:\n\\[ 25 + 4 = 29 \\]\n\nThen, five less than 15 geese leave the park. The number of geese that leave is:\n\\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \\]\nSo, the total number of geese now is:\n\\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \\]\n\nFinally, we need to find how many more geese than ducks remain at the park. We subtract the number of ducks from the number of geese:\n\\[ 30 - 29 = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of geese that remain at the park is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",
