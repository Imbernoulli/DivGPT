        "To determine how much money John has left after his purchases, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial amount of money John has, which is €100.\n2. Determine the total cost of the items he buys. He buys a roast for €17 and vegetables for €11. So, we add these amounts together:\n   \\[\n   17 + 11 = 28\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total cost of the items is €28.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount of money to find out how much money John has left:\n   \\[\n   100 - 28 = 72\n   \\]\n   So, John has €72 left.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{72}.",
