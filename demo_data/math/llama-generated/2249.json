        "To determine James' older brother's age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine John's age 3 years ago:**\n   John is currently 39 years old. Three years ago, he was:\n   \\[\n   39 - 3 = 36 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up the equation for James' age in 6 years:**\n   Let \\( J \\) represent James' current age. According to the problem, 3 years ago John was twice as old as James will be in 6 years. Therefore, we can write:\n   \\[\n   36 = 2(J + 6)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for James' current age:**\n   First, expand the right-hand side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   36 = 2J + 12\n   \\]\n   Next, isolate \\( J \\) by subtracting 12 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   36 - 12 = 2J \\implies 24 = 2J\n   \\]\n   Finally, divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   J = 12\n   \\]\n   So, James is currently 12 years old.\n\n4. **Determine James' older brother's age:**\n   James' older brother is 4 years older than James. Therefore, his age is:\n   \\[\n   12 + 4 = 16\n   \\]\n\nThus, James' older brother is \\(\\boxed{16}\\) years old.",

Therefore, his age is:\n   \\[\n   12 + 4 = 16\n   \\]\n\nThus, James' older brother is \\(\\boxed{16}\\) years old.",
        "To determine the current age of James and his older brother, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine John's age 3 years ago:**\n   John is currently 39 years old. Three years ago, he was:\n   \\[\n   39 - 3 = 36 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up the equation for James' age:**\n   According to the problem, 3 years ago John was twice as old as James will be in 6 years. Let \\( J \\) represent James' current age. In 6 years, James will be:\n   \\[\n   J + 6\n   \\]\n   Three years ago, John was 36, which is twice:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times (J + 6)\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   36 = 2 \\times (J + 6)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( J \\):**\n   First, simplify the right-hand side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   36 = 2J + 12\n   \\]\n   Next, isolate \\(bounds by subtracting 12 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   36 - 12 = 2J\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   24 = 2J\n   \\]\n   Finally, solve for \\( J \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   J = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the age of James' older brother:**\n   James' older brother is 4 years older than James. Therefore, his age is:\n   \\[\n   12 + 4 = 16 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the age of James' older brother is \\(\\boxed{16}\\)."
