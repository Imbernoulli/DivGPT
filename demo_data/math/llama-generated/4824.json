        "To determine the total number of pages Coral read over the three nights, we need to calculate the number of pages read each night and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many pages Coral read on night 2. According to the problem, she reads 2 less than twice the number of pages she read on night 1. Since she read 30 pages on night 1, we can calculate the pages read on night 2 as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 30 - 2 = 60 - 2 = 58\n\\]\nSo, Coral read 58 pages on night 2.\n\nNext, let's find out how many pages Coral read on night 3. The problem states that she reads 3 more pages than the sum of the pages read on the first two nights. First, we calculate the sum of the pages read on the first two nights:\n\\[\n30 + 58 = 88\n\\]\nThen, we add 3 to this sum to find the number of pages read on night 3:\n\\[\n88 + 3 = 91\n\\]\nSo, Coral read 91 pages on night 3.\n\nNow, we sum up the pages read over the three nights:\n\\[\n30 + 58 + 91 = 179\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of pages Coral read in the 3 nights is \\boxed{179}.",
