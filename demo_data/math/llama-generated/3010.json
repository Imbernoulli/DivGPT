        "To determine how many more pages Cristobal read compared to Beatrix, we start by calculating the number of pages Cristobal read. According to the problem, Cristobal read 15 more than three times the pages that Beatrix read. We know that Beatrix read 704 pages. Let's denote the number of pages Beatrix read as \\( B \\) and the number of pages Cristobal read as \\( C \\). We have:\n\n\\[ B = 704 \\]\n\\[ C = 3B + 15 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( B \\) into the equation for \\( C \\), we get:\n\n\\[ C = 3 \\times 704 + 15 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 3 \\times 704 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 704 = 2112 \\]\n\nNext, we add 15 to 2112:\n\n\\[ 2112 + 15 = 2127 \\]\n\nSo, Cristobal read 2127 pages. To find out how many more pages Cristobal read compared to Beatrix, we subtract the number of pages Beatrix read from the number of pages Cristobal read:\n\n\\[ 2127 - 704 = 1423 \\]\n\nTherefore, Cristobal read \\(\\boxed{1423}\\) more pages than Beatrix.",

We do this by subtracting the number of pages Beatrix read from the number of pages Cristobal read:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Pages Cristobal read} - \\text{Pages Beatrix read} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 2127 - 704 \\]\n\nFinally, we perform the subtraction:\n\\[ 2127 - 704 = 1423 \\]\n\nTherefore, Cristobal read \\(\\boxed{1423}\\) more pages than Beatrix.",
