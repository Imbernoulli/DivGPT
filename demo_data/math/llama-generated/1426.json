The set of 7 spoons costs $21, so we divide the total cost by the number of spoons:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of one spoon} = \\frac{21}{7} = 3\n\\]\nEach spoon costs $3.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for 5 spoons by multiplying the cost of one spoon by 5:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of 5 spoons} = 5 \\times 3 = 15\n\\]\nTherefore, the cost of 5 spoons is \\boxed{15}.",
