        "To determine how many games Sarah won, we start by defining the variables:\n- Let \\( w \\) be the number of games Sarah won.\n- Let \\( t \\) be the number of games Sarah tied.\n- Let \\( l \\) be the number of games Sarah lost.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. Sarah played a total of 100 games.\n2. She tied 40 games.\n3. She lost $30 in total.\n\nWe can express the total number of games as:\n\\[ w + t + l = 100 \\]\n\nSince \\( t = 40 \\), we can substitute this into the equation:\n\\[ w + 40 + l = 100 \\]\n\nSubtracting 40 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ w + l = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we use the information about the money she won and lost. Sarah wins $1 for each game she wins, loses $2 for each game she loses, and ties $0 for each game she ties. Therefore, the total倒숍觏 can be expressed as:\n\\[ 1w + 0t - 2l = -30 \\]\n\nSince \\( t = 40 \\), this equation simplifies to:\n\\[ w - 2l = -30 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations:\n1. \\( w + l = 60 \\)\n2. \\( w - 2l = -30 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system using the method of elimination. First, we multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \\( l \\):\n\\[ 2w + 2l = 120 \\]\n\nNow we add this equation to the second equation:\n\\[ (2w + 2l) + (w - 2l) = 120 + (-30) \\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ 3w = 90 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we find:\n\\[ w = 30 \\]\n\nThus, Sarah won \\(\\boxed{30}\\) games.",

First, we multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \\( l \\):\n\\[ 2w + 2l = 120 \\]\n\nNow we add this equation to the second equation:\n\\[ (2w + 2l) + (w - 2l) = 120 + (-30) \\]\n\\[ 3w = 90 \\]\n\\[ w = 30 \\]\n\nSo, Sarah won \\( \\boxed{30} \\) games.\n\nTo verify, we substitute \\( w = 30 \\) back into the first equation:\n\\[ 30 + l = 60 \\]\n\\[ l = 30 \\]\n\nNow we check the total amount of money earned:\n\\[ 1 \\cdot 30 + 0 \\cdot 40 - 2 \\cdot 30 = 30 - 60 = -30 \\]\n\nThe calculations confirm that Sarah lost $30, so the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of games Sarah won is \\( \\boxed{30} \\).",
        "To determine how many games Sarah won, we need to break down the information given and set up an equation.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- Let \\( w \\) be the number of games Sarah won.\n- Let \\( t \\) be the number of games Sarah tied.\n- Let \\( l \\) be the number of games Sarah lost.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1.

The total loss is $30.\n\nWe can express the total number of games played as:\n\\[ w + t + l = 100 \\]\n\nSubstituting the given value for \\( t \\):\n\\[ w + 40 + l = 100 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( w + l \\):\n\\[ w + l = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we need to consider theidentity for the total earnings. Sarah earns $1 for each win, $0 for each tie, and loses $2 for each loss. Therefore, her total earnings can be expressed as:\n\\[ 1w + 0t - 2l = -30 \\]\n\nSubstituting the given value for \\( t \\):\n\\[ w - 2l = -30 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of linear equations:\n1. \\( w + l = 60 \\)\n2. \\( w - 2l = -30 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, solve for \\( w \\):\n\\[ w = 60 - l \\]\n\nSubstitute this expression for \\( w \\) into the second equation:\n\\[ (60 - l) - 2l = -30 \\]\n\nSimplify and solve for \\( l \\):\n\\[ 60 - 3l = -30 \\]\n\\[ 60 + 30 = 3l \\]\n\\[ 90 = 3l \\]\n\\[ l = 30 \\]\n\nNow substitute \\( l = 30 \\) back into the expression for \\( w \\):\n\\[ w = 60 - 30 \\]\n\\[ w = 30 \\]\n\nThus, the number of games Sarah won is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

        "To determine how many games Sarah won, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Sarah won and lost:**\n   - Sarah played a total of 100 games.\n   - She tied 40 of them.\n   - Therefore, the number of games she either won or lost is \\(100 - 40 = 60\\).\n\n2. **Set up the equation for the total earnings:**\n   - Let \\(w\\) be the number of games Sarah won.\n   - Then, the number of games she lost is \\(60 - w\\).\n   - According to the problem, she wins $1 for each game she wins, loses $2 for each game she loses, and earns $0 for each tie.\n   - So, her total earnings can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\cdot w + 0 \\cdot 40 + (-2) \\cdot (60 - w) = -30\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     w - 2(60 - w) = -30\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     w - 120 + 2w = -30\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3w - 120 = -30\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3w = -30 + 120\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3w = 90\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     w = \\frac{90}{3}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     w = 30\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of games Sarah won is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
        "Let's define the variables first:\n- Let \\( w \\) be the number of games Sarah won.\n- Let \\( t \\) be the number of games Sarah tied.\n- Let \\( l \\) be the number of games Sarah lost.\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following:\n1. Sarah played a total of 100 games.\n2. She tied 40 games.\n3. She lost $30 in total.\n\nWe can express the total number of games played as:\n\\[ w + t + l = 100 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( t \\) (which is 40) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ w + 40 + l = 100 \\]\nSubtracting 40 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ w + l = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the total profit or loss. Sarah wins $1 for each game she wins, loses $2 for each game she loses, and earns $0 for each game she ties. Therefore, her total profit or loss can be expressed as:\n\\[ 1w + 0t - 2l = -30 \\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ w - 2l = -30 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations:\n1. \\( w + l = 60 \\)\n2. \\( w - 2l = -30 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system by elimination. First, we'll eliminate \\( w \\) by subtracting the second equation from the first equation:\n\\[ (w + l) - (w - 2l) = 60 - (-30) \\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ w + l - w + 2l = 60 + 30 \\]\n\\[ 3l = 90 \\]\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\\[ l = 30 \\]\n\nNow that we know \\( l = 30 \\), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \\( w \\):\n\\[ w + 30 = 60 \\]\nSubtracting 30 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ w = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of games Sarah won is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

The total number of games played is 100.\n2. The number of games tied is 40.\n3. The total loss is $30.\n\nWe can express the total number of games as:\n\\[ w + t + l = 100 \\]\n\nSubstituting the known value of \\( t \\) (which is 40) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ w + 40 + l = 100 \\]\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for \\( w + l \\), we have:\n\\[ w + l = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we use the information about the total loss. Sarah wins $1 for each game she wins, loses $2 for each game she loses, and ties games for $0. Therefore, her total loss can be expressed as:\n\\[ 1w - 2l = -30 \\]\n\nWe now have a system of linear equations:\n1. \\( w + l = 60 \\)\n2. \\( w - 2l = -30 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system using the method of elimination. First, we multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \\( l \\):\n\\[ 2w + 2l = 120 \\]\n\nNow we add this equation to the second equation:\n\\[ (2w + 2l) + (w - 2l) = 120 + (-30) \\]\n\\[ 3w = 90 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( w \\), we get:\n\\[ w = \\frac{90}{3} \\]\n\\[ w = 30 \\]\n\nSo, Sarah won \\(\\boxed{30}\\) games.",

According to the problem, her total earnings are $-30. So, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   1 \\cdot w + 0 \\cdot 40 + (-2) \\cdot (60 - w) = -30\n   \\]\n   Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   w - 2(60 - w) = -30\n   \\]\n   Distribute the -2:\n   \\[\n   w - 120 + 2w = -30\n   \\]\n   Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   3w - 120 = -30\n   \\]\n   Add 120 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   3w = 90\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   w = 30\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Sarah won \\(\\boxed{30}\\) games.",
        "Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many games Sarah won.\n\nFirst, we know that Sarah played a total of 100 games. Out of these, she tied 40 games. Therefore, the number of games she either won or lost is:\n\\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \\]\n\nLet's denote the number of games Sarah won as \\( W \\). Since the total number of games she won or lost is 60, the number of games she lost is:\n\\[ 60 - W \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Sarah wins $1 for every game she wins, loses $2 for every game she loses, and earns $0 for every game she ties. Her total earnings from all the games can be expressed as:\n\\[ 1 \\cdot W + 0 \\cdot 40 - 2 \\cdot (60 - W) \\]\n\nWe know from the problem that her total earnings are $-30.
