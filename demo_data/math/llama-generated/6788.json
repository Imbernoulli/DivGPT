        "To determine how many televisions the electronics store will sell on Black Friday three years from now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the number of televisions sold last Black Friday:**\n   We know that this year the store sold 327 televisions, which is 50 more than last year. Therefore, we can calculate the number of televisions sold last year by subtracting 50 from 327:\n   \\[\n   327 - 50 = 277\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the sales for each of the next three years:**\n   According to the problem, the store sells 50 more televisions each year. Let's calculate the number of televisions sold in each of the next three years:\n   - **One year from now:**\n     \\[\n     327 + 50 = 377\n     \\]\n   - **Two years from now:**\n     \\[\n     377 + 50 = 427\n     \\]\n   - **Three years from now:**\n     \\[\n     427 + 50 = 477\n     \\]\n\n3. **State the final answer:**\n   The number of televisions the store will sell on Black Friday three years from now is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{477}\n   \\]",
        "To determine the number of televisions the store will sell three years from now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the number of televisions sold last Black Friday:**\n   Given that this year they sold 327 televisions, which is 50 more than last Black Friday, we can calculate last year's sales as follows:\n   \\[\n   327 - 50 = 277\n   \\]\n   So, last Black Friday they sold 277 televisions.\n\n2. **Calculate the sales for each subsequent year:**\n   - **Next year:**\n     They sell 50 more televisions than this year. Therefore, the number of televisions sold next year is:\n     \\[\n     327 + 50 = 377\n     \\]\n\n   - **Two years from now:**\n     They sell 50 more televisions than next year. Therefore, the number of televisions sold two years from now is:\n     \\[\n     377 + 50 = 427\n     \\]\n\n   - **Three years from now:**\n     They sell 50 more televisions than two years from now. Therefore, the number of televisions sold three years from now is:\n     \\[\n     427 + 50 = 477\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of televisions the store will sell on Black Friday three years from now is \\(\\boxed{477}\\).",
