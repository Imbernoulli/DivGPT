        "To determine the number of pieces of candy in the peanut butter jar, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of pieces of candy in the banana jar.\n2. Use the information given to find the number of pieces of candy in the grape jar.\n3. Use the information given to find the number of pieces of candy in the peanut butter jar.\n\nLet's start with the banana jar. We know that the banana jar has 43 pieces of candy. Let's denote the number of pieces of candy in the banana jar as \\( B \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ B = 43 \\]\n\nNext, we know that the grape jar has 5 more pieces of candy than the banana jar. Let's denote the number of pieces of candy in the grape jar as \\( G \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ G = B + 5 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( B \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ G = 43 + 5 = 48 \\]\n\nNow, we know that the peanut butter jar has 4 times as much candy as the grape jar. Let's denote the number of pieces of candy in the peanut butter jar as \\( P \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ P = 4 \\times G \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( G \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ P = 4 \\times 48 = 192 \\]\n\nThus, the number of pieces of candy in the peanut butter jar is \\(\\boxed{192}\\).",

The problem states that the grape jar had 5 more pieces of candy than the banana jar. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pieces of candy in the grape jar as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pieces of candy in the grape jar} = \\text{Number of pieces of candy in the banana jar} + 5 = 43 + 5 = 48\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many pieces of candy were in the peanut butter jar. The problem states that the peanut butter jar had 4 times as much candy as the grape jar. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pieces of candy in the peanut butter jar as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pieces of candy in the peanut butter jar} = 4 \\times \\text{Number of pieces of candy in the grape jar} = 4 \\times 48 = 192\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of pieces of candy in the peanut butter jar is \\boxed{192}.",
