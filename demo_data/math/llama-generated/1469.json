Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[\n12 = \\frac{\\text{Total number of carnations}}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo find the total number of carnations, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of carnations} = 12 \\times 3 = 36\n\\]\n\nNext, we know the number of carnations in the first two bouquets: 9 carnations and 14 carnations. Let \\( x \\) be the number of carnations in the third bouquet. The total number of carnations in all three bouquets is then:\n\n\\[\n9 + 14 + x\n\\]\n\nWe already know this total is 36, so we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n9 + 14 + x = 36\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\n\\[\n23 + x = 36\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we subtract 23 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = 36 - 23 = 13\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of carnations in the third bouquet is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]"
