We subtract the total number of steps he has already walked from the total number of steps he needs to walk:\n\\[ 63000 - 44900 = 18100 \\]\n\nToby needs to walk 18,100 steps over Friday and Saturday. To find the average number of steps he needs to walk on each of these two days, we divide 18,100 by 2:\n\\[ 18100 \\div 2 = 9050 \\]\n\nTherefore, Toby needs to average \\(\\boxed{9050}\\) steps on Friday and Saturday to meet his goal.",

To find out how many more steps he needs to walk over the last two days, we subtract the number of steps he has already walked from his total goal:\n\n\\[ 63,000 - 44,900 = 18,100 \\]\n\nToby needs to walk a total of 18,100 steps over the last two days. To find the average number of steps he needs to walk on Friday and Saturday, we divide this total by 2:\n\n\\[ 18,100 \\div 2 = 9,050 \\]\n\nTherefore, Toby needs to average \\(\\boxed{9050}\\) steps on Friday and Saturday to meet his goal.",
