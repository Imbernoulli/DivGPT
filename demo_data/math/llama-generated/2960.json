        "To determine how much Manny will have left after buying one portable table and two chairs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the cost of one plastic chair:**\n   - We know that five plastic chairs cost $55.\n   - Therefore, the cost of one plastic chair is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of one plastic chair} = \\frac{55}{5} = 11 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the cost of one portable table:**\n   - We know that three plastic chairs cost as much as one portable table.\n   - Since one plastic chair costs $11, the cost of three plastic chairs is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of three plastic chairs} = 3 \\times 11 = 33 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the cost of one portable table is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of one portable table} = 33 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of one portable table and two chairs:**\n   - The cost of one portable table is $33.\n   - The cost of two plastic chairs is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of two plastic chairs} = 2 \\times 11 = 22 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost} = 33 + 22 = 55 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine how much Manny will have left after his purchase:**\n   - Manny has $100.\n   - The total cost of one portable table and two chairs is $55.\n   - Therefore, the amount left is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Amount left} = 100 - 55 = 45 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the amount left in Manny's $100 after buying one portable table and two chairs is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
