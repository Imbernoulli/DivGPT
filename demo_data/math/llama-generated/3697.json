Subtract the number of pencils he sold from the total number of pencils he had.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pencils Paul made during the week. He makes 100 pencils a day and works 5 days a week:\n\\[\n100 \\text{ pencils/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 500 \\text{ pencils}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the pencils he made to his initial stock. Paul started with 80 pencils:\n\\[\n80 \\text{ pencils} + 500 \\text{ pencils} = 580 \\text{ pencils}\n\\]\n\nThen, we subtract the number of pencils he sold from the total number of pencils he had:\n\\[\n580 \\text{ pencils} - 350 \\text{ pencils} = 230 \\text{ pencils}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pencils Paul had in his stock at the end of the week is \\boxed{230}.",
        "To determine how many pencils Paul had in his stock at the end of the week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pencils Paul made during the week.\n2. Determine the initial number of pencils and the number of pencils sold during the week.\n3. Use these values to find the final number of pencils in stock.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pencils Paul made during the week. Since he makes 100 pencils a day and works 5 days a week, we have:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ pencils/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 500 \\text{ pencils} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total change in the number of pencils from the beginning of the week to the end of the week. This change is the sum of the pencils he made and the pencils he sold (with the pencils sold being a negative value since they reduce the stock). Paul started with 80 pencils, made 500 pencils, and sold 350 pencils. Therefore, the final number of pencils in stock is:\n\\[ 80 + 500 - 350 = 230 \\]\n\nSo, the number of pencils Paul had in his stock at the end of the week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{230} \\]",
