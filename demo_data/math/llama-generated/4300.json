        "To determine how many flowers are remaining in Mr. Wells's garden after he cuts 60% of the flowers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.\n2. Determine how many flowers Mr. Wells cuts.\n3. Subtract the number of cut flowers from the total number of flowers to find out how many flowers are remaining.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of flowers in the garden. The garden has 50 rows, and each row has 400 flowers:\n\\[\n50 \\times 400 = 20000\n\\]\nSo, the total number of flowers is 20000.\n\nNext, we determine how many flowers Mr. Wells cuts. He cuts 60% of the flowers:\n\\[\n60\\% \\text{ of } 20000 = 0.60 \\times 20000 = 12000\n\\]\nSo, Mr. Wells cuts 12000 flowers.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of cut flowers from the total number of flowers to find out how many flowers are remaining:\n\\[\n20000 - 12000 = 8000\n\\]\nSo, the number of flowers remaining in the garden is \\boxed{8000}.",

Subtract the number of cut flowers from the total number of flowers to find the number of flowers remaining.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of flowers in the garden. The garden has 50 rows, and each row has 400 flowers:\n\\[\n50 \\times 400 = 20000\n\\]\nSo, the total number of flowers is 20000.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many flowers Mr. Wells cuts. He cuts 60% of the flowers. To find 60% of 20000, we multiply 20000 by 0.60:\n\\[\n20000 \\times 0.60 = 12000\n\\]\nSo, Mr. Wells cuts 12000 flowers.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of cut flowers from the total number of flowers to find the number of flowers remaining:\n\\[\n20000 - 12000 = 8000\n\\]\nSo, the number of flowers remaining in the garden is \\boxed{8000}.",
