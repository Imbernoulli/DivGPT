According to the problem, we have the following system of equations:\n\n1. The pair of pants and shirt costs $100:\n   \\[\n   P + S = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. The pants and coat cost $244:\n   \\[\n   P + C = 244\n   \\]\n\n3. The coat costs 5 times as much as the shirt:\n   \\[\n   C = 5S\n   \\]\n\nWe can substitute the third equation into the second equation to eliminate \\( C \\):\n\\[\nP + 5S = 244\n\\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nP + S = 100 \\\\\nP + 5S = 244\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate \\( P \\), we subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\\[\n(P + 5S) - (P + S) = 244 - 100\n\\]\n\\[\n4S = 144\n\\]\n\\[\nS = \\frac{144}{4} = 36\n\\]\n\nNow that we know the cost of the shirt \\( S = 36 \\), we can substitute this value back into the third equation to find the cost of the coat:\n\\[\nC = 5S = 5 \\times 36 = 180\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the coat is \\(\\boxed{180}\\)."
