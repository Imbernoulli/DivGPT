There are 3 bedrooms, 1 living room, and 2 bathrooms to clean.  The bedrooms each take 20 minutes to clean.  The living room takes as long as the 3 bedrooms combined.  The bathroom takes twice as long as the living room.  He also cleans the outside which takes twice as long as cleaning the house.  He splits the chores with his 2 siblings who are just as fast as him.  How long, in hours, does he work?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how long James works, we need to calculate the total time required to clean all the rooms and the outside, and then divide this time by 3 (since James splits the chores with his 2 siblings).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time to clean each type of room:\n\n1. **Bedrooms**: There are 3 bedrooms, and each takes 20 minutes to clean.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 20 = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Living Room**: The living room takes as long as the 3 bedrooms combined.\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Bathrooms**: There are 2 bathrooms, and each takes twice as long as the living room.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Outside**: The outside takes twice as long as cleaning the house.\n   - First, we calculate the total time to clean the house:\n     \\[\n     60 \\text{ minutes (bedrooms)} + 60 \\text{ minutes (living room)} + 120 \\text{ minutes (bathrooms)} = 240 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Then, the time to clean the outside:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 240 = 480 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nNext, we sum up the total time to clean all the rooms and the outside:\n\\[\n240 \\text{ minutes (house)} + 480 \\text{ minutes (outside)} = 720 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nSince James splits the chores with his 2 siblings, the total number of people working is 3.
