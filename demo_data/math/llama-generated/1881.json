        "To determine how many stickers Jerry has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many stickers George has.\n2. Use the number of stickers George has to find out how many stickers Jerry has.\n\nFirst, we know that Fred has 18 stickers. According to the problem, George has 6 fewer stickers than Fred. Therefore, we can calculate the number of stickers George has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of stickers George has} = \\text{Number of stickers Fred has} - 6 = 18 - 6 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Jerry has three times as many stickers as George. Therefore, we can calculate the number of stickers Jerry has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of stickers Jerry has} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of stickers George has} = 3 \\times 12 = 36\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of stickers Jerry has is \\boxed{36}.",
