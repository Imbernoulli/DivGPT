        "To determine how much Ofelia will save in May, we need to calculate her savings for each month from January to May, given that she saves twice the amount she saved the previous month. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **January**: Ofelia saved $10.\n2. **February**: She saved twice the amount she saved in January. Therefore, her savings in February are \\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\) dollars.\n3. **March**: She saved twice the amount she saved in February. Therefore, her savings in March are \\(20 \\times 2 = 40\\) dollars.\n4. **April**: She saved twice the amount she saved in March. Therefore, her savings in April are \\(40 \\times 2 = 80\\) dollars.\n5. **May**: She saved twice the amount she saved in April. Therefore, her savings in May are \\(80 \\times 2 = 160\\) dollars.\n\nSo, the amount Ofelia is going to save in May is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
