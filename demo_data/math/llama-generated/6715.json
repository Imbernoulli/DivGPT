        "To determine how much money Casey saves by paying monthly instead of weekly, we need to calculate the total cost of her stay under both payment plans and then find the difference between the two amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost if Casey pays weekly. Each month has exactly 4 weeks, and there are 3 months. Therefore, the total number of weeks Casey will be staying is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ months} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 12 \\text{ weeks} \\]\nThe cost per week is $280, so the total cost for 12 weeks is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ weeks} \\times 280 \\text{ dollars/week} = 3360 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost if Casey pays monthly. The cost per month is $1000, and she is staying for 3 months. Therefore, the total cost for 3 months is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ months} \\times 1000 \\text{ dollars/month} = 3000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the total cost of paying weekly and the total cost of paying monthly to determine how much money Casey saves by paying monthly:\n\\[ 3360 \\text{ dollars} - 3000 \\text{ dollars} = 360 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, Casey saves \\(\\boxed{360}\\) dollars by paying monthly.",
