        "To determine how much money the company will earn by selling 1 week's worth of production, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of computers produced in one week.\n2. Multiply the total number of computers produced in one week by the price per computer.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many computers are produced in one week. The factory produces 1500 computers per day, and there are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total number of computers produced in one week is:\n\\[ 1500 \\text{ computers/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 10500 \\text{ computers} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money the company earns by selling these 10500 computers. Each computer is sold for $150, so the total earnings are:\n\\[ 10500 \\text{ computers} \\times 150 \\text{ dollars/computer} = 1575000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the company will earn \\(\\boxed{1575000}\\) dollars by selling 1 week's worth of production.",
