        "Let's denote Fred's weekly allowance by \\( A \\). According to the problem, Fred spent half of his allowance going to the movies, so he spent \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) dollars.

So, his total amount of money after washing the car is \\( \\frac{A}{2} + 6 \\) dollars. We know from the problem that after these transactions, Fred ended with 14 dollars.
