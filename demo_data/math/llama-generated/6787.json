        "To determine the number of green chips in Lara's bag, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of blue chips.\n2. Determine the total number of red and blue chips.\n3. Subtract the total number of red and blue chips from the total number of chips to find the number of green chips.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of blue chips. Since one-sixth of the chips are blue, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue chips} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 60 = 10\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of red and blue chips:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of red and blue chips} = \\text{Number of red chips} + \\text{Number of blue chips} = 34 + 10 = 44\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of red and blue chips from the total number of chips to find the number of green chips:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of green chips} = \\text{Total number of chips} - \\text{Total number of red and blue chips} = 60 - 44 = 16\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of green chips in Lara's bag is \\boxed{16}.",

To find the number of green chips, we subtract the number of blue and red chips from the total number of chips:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of green chips} = 60 - (\\text{Number of blue chips} + \\text{Number of red chips}) = 60 - (10 + 34) = 60 - 44 = 16\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of green chips in Lara's bag is \\boxed{16}.",
