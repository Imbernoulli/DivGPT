        "To determine the height of the sunflowers from Packet B, we start by understanding the relationship between the heights of the sunflowers from Packet A and Packet B. According to the problem, the sunflowers from Packet A are 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B. This means that the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 120% of the height of the sunflowers from Packet B.\n\nLet's denote the height of the sunflowers from Packet B as \\( h \\) inches. Since the sunflowers from Packet A are 120% of the height of the sunflowers from Packet B, we can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\\[ 192 = 1.2h \\]\n\nTo find \\( h \\), we need to solve the equation for \\( h \\).
