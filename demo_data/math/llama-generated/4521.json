        "To determine how many times Tony will fill his 84-ounce water bottle each week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of water Tony drinks in a week.\n2. Determine how many times he needs to fill his water bottle to meet his weekly water consumption.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water Tony drinks in a week.**\n\nTony drinks 72 ounces of water per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily amount by the number of days in a week:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ ounces/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 504 \\text{ ounces/week} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many times he needs to fill his water bottle to meet his weekly water consumption.**\n\nThe water bottle holds 84 ounces. To find out how many times Tony needs to fill it, we divide the total weekly water consumption by the capacity of the water bottle:\n\\[ 504 \\text{ ounces/week} \\div 84 \\text{ ounces/bottle} = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, Tony will fill his water bottle \\(\\boxed{6}\\) times each week.",
