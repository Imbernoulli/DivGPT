        "To determine the total amount of money Harriett found, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the quarters:\n- Each quarter is worth $0.25.\n- Harriett found 10 quarters.\n\\[\n10 \\times 0.25 = 2.50\n\\]\nSo, the value of the quarters is $2.50.\n\nNext, let's calculate the value of the dimes:\n- Each dime is worth $0.10.\n- Harriett found 3 dimes.\n\\[\n3 \\times 0.10 = 0.30\n\\]\nSo, the value of the dimes is $0.30.\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of the nickels:\n- Each nickel is worth $0.05.\n- Harriett found 3 nickels.\n\\[\n3 \\times 0.05 = 0.15\n\\]\nSo, the value of the nickels is $0.15.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the value of the pennies:\n- Each penny is worth $0.01.\n- Harriett found 5 pennies.\n\\[\n5 \\times 0.01 = 0.05\n\\]\nSo, the value of the pennies is $0.05.\n\nNow, we sum the values of all the coins:\n\\[\n2.50 + 0.30 + 0.15 + 0.05 = 3.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Harriett found is \\boxed{3.00}.",
