Since one dozen equals 12 strawberries, we can calculate the total number of strawberries as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ dozen} = 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ strawberries} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of strawberries Micah eats from the total number of strawberries:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ strawberries} - 6 \\text{ strawberries} = 18 \\text{ strawberries} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of strawberries Micah saves for his mom is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
