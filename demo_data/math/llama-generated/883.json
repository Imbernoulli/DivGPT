Therefore, the total amount paid by these people is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 200 = 6000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between the two amounts.**\n\nTo find out how many more dollars the people at the gate paid than those who pre-bought their tickets, we subtract the total amount paid by the pre-buyers from the total amount paid by the gateendtime:\n\\[ 6000 - 3100 = 2900 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the people at the gate paid \\(\\boxed{2900}\\) more dollars for their tickets than those passengers that pre-bought their tickets.",
