        "To determine Calvin's weight after one year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial weight of Calvin.\n2. Determine the monthly weight loss.\n3. Calculate the total weight loss over one year.\n4. Subtract the total weight loss from the initial weight.\n\nFirst, we know Calvin's initial weight is 250 pounds. He loses 8 pounds every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, we calculate the total weight loss over one year as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total weight loss} = 8 \\text{ pounds/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months} = 96 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total weight loss from the initial weight to find Calvin's weight after one year:\n\n\\[ \\text{Weight after one year} = 250 \\text{ pounds} - 96 \\text{ pounds} = 154 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, Calvin's weight after one year is \\(\\boxed{154}\\).",

Subtract the total weight loss from the initial weight to find Calvin's weight after one year:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight after one year} = \\text{Initial weight} - \\text{Total weight loss} = 250 \\, \\text{pounds} - 96 \\, \\text{pounds} = 154 \\, \\text{pounds}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Calvin's weight after one year is \\(\\boxed{154}\\).",
