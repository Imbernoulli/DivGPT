        "To determine Janice's age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Mark's age.\n2. Determine Graham's age based on Mark's age.\n3. Calculate Janice's age based on Graham's age.\n\nFirst, let's find out how old Mark is. Mark was born in January 1976, and it is currently February 2021. Therefore, Mark is:\n\\[ 2021 - 1976 = 45 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how old Graham is. Graham is 3 years younger than Mark, so:\n\\[ 45 - 3 = 42 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nFinally, we need to determine Janice's age. Janice is half the age of Graham, so:\n\\[ \\frac{42}{2} = 21 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nThus, Janice is \\(\\boxed{21}\\) years old.",
        "To determine Janice's age, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Calculate Mark's age:**\n   - Mark was born in January 1976.\n   - It is currently February 2021.\n   - Mark's age in February 2021 is \\(2021 - 1976 = 45\\) years.\n\n2. **Determine Graham's age:**\n   - Graham is 3 years younger than Mark.\n   - Therefore, Graham's age is \\(45 - 3 = 42\\) years.\n\n3. **Calculate Janice's age:**\n   - Janice is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) the age of Graham.\n   - Therefore, Janice's age is \\(\\frac{42}{2} = 21\\) years.\n\nThus, Janice is \\(\\boxed{21}\\) years old.",

So, Graham's age is:\n\\[ 45 - 3 = 42 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nFinally, we need to determine Janice's age. Janice is 1/2 the age of Graham. So, Janice's age is:\n\\[ \\frac{42}{2} = 21 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nTherefore, Janice is \\(\\boxed{21}\\) years old.",
