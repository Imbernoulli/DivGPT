        "To find Jane's speed in meters per minute, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the distance from kilometers to meters.\n2. Convert the time from hours to minutes.\n3. Calculate the speed using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the distance from kilometers to meters.**\n\nWe know that 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters. Therefore, 3 kilometers is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ kilometers} = 3 \\times 1000 \\text{ meters} = 3000 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Convert the time from hours to minutes.**\n\nWe know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. Therefore, 2 hours is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the speed using the formula: speed = distance / time.**\n\nNow that we have the distance in meters and the time in minutes, we can calculate the speed:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{3000 \\text{ meters}}{120 \\text{ minutes}} = 25 \\text{ meters per minute} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jane's speed in meters per minute is:\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]",
        "To determine Jane's speed in meters per minute, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert kilometers to meters:**\n   Jane runs 3 kilometers. Since 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters, we convert kilometers to meters by multiplying:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ kilometers} \\times 1000 \\text{ meters/kilometer} = 3000 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert hours to minutes:**\n   Jane runs for 2 hours.

Therefore, 2 hours is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the speed using the formula: speed = distance / time.**\n\nNow we can find the speed in meters per minute by dividing the distance by the time:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{3000 \\text{ meters}}{120 \\text{ minutes}} = 25 \\text{ meters per minute} \\]\n\nSo, Jane's speed is \\(\\boxed{25}\\) meters per minute.",
        "To determine Jane's speed in meters per minute, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert kilometers to meters:**\n   Jane runs 3 kilometers. Since 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters, we convert kilometers to meters by multiplying by 1000:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ kilometers} = 3 \\times 1000 \\text{ meters} = 3000 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert hours to minutes:**\n   Jane runs for 2 hours. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate speed in meters per minute:**\n   Speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. Here, the distance is 3000 meters and the time is 120 minutes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{3000 \\text{ meters}}{120 \\text{ minutes}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   To simplify \\(\\frac{3000}{120}\\), we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 3000 and 120 is 120:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3000 \\div 120}{120 \\div 120} = \\frac{25}{1} = 25\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jane's speed is \\(\\boxed{25}\\) meters per minute.",
