        "To determine how much you will save from buying 3 sets of 2 dozens of doughnuts instead of buying 6 sets of 1 dozen, we need to calculate the total cost for both scenarios and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of buying 6 sets of 1 dozen doughnuts:\n- The cost of 1 dozen doughnuts is $8.\n- Therefore, the cost of 6 sets of 1 dozen doughnuts is \\(6 \\times 8 = 48\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of buying 3 sets of 2 dozens of doughnuts:\n- The cost of 2 dozens of doughnuts is $14.\n- Therefore, the cost of 3 sets of 2 dozens of doughnuts is \\(3 \\times 14 = 42\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we find the difference in cost between the two scenarios:\n- The cost of buying 6 sets of 1 dozen doughnuts is $48.\n- The cost of buying 3 sets of 2 dozens of doughnuts is $42.\n- The savings is \\(48 - 42 = 6\\) dollars.\n\nThus, you will save \\(\\boxed{6}\\) dollars from buying 3 sets of 2 dozens instead of buying 6 sets of 1 dozen.",
