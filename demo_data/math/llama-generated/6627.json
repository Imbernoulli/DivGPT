        "To determine how many hours it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, find out how many pages Joy reads per minute.\n   Joy reads 8 pages in 20 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8 \\text{ pages}}{20 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.4 \\text{ pages per minute}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, calculate the total time in minutes it will take Joy to read 120 pages.\n   Since she reads 0.4 pages per minute, the time required to read 120 pages is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120 \\text{ pages}}{0.4 \\text{ pages per minute}} = 300 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3.
