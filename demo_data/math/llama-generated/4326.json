        "To determine the minimum number of trees Felix has chopped down, we start by calculating how many times he has getting his axe resharpened. Since each sharpening costs $5 and he has spent $35, we divide $35 by $5:\n\n\\[\n35 \\div 5 = 7\n\\]\n\nThis means Felix has sharpened his axe 7 times. Since he needs to sharpen his axe after chopping down 13 trees each time, the total number of trees he has chopped down is:\n\n\\[\n7 \\times 13 = 91\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of trees Felix has chopped down is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{91}\n\\]",
