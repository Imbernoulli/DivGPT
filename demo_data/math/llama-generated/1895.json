        "Let's denote the amount of money Nigel gave away as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we know that Nigel initially won $45. After giving away \\( x \\) dollars, he had \\( 45 - x \\) dollars. Then, his mother gave him $80, so his total amount of money became:\n\\[ (45 - x) + 80 = 125 - x. \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, this amount is $10 more than twice the amount he originally had. Since he originally had $45, twice this amount is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 45 = 90, \\]\nand $10 more than this is:\n\\[ 90 + 10 = 100. \\]\n\nSo, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 125 - x = 100. \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 100 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 125 - 100 = x, \\]\n\\[ x = 25. \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Nigel gave away is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
        "Let's denote the amount of money Nigel gave away as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we start with the initial amount of money Nigel won, which is $45. After giving away \\( x \\) dollars, the amount of money he has left is \\( 45 - x \\).\n\nNext, his mother gave him $80. So, the total amount of money Nigel has now is \\( (45 - x) + 80 = 125 - x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the amount of money Nigel has now is $10 more than twice the amount he originally had. The amount he originally had is $45, so twice this amount is \\( 2 \\times 45 = 90 \\). Adding $10 to this gives \\( 90 + 10 = 100 \\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 125 - x = 100 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation by isolating \\( x \\):\n\\[ 125 - x = 100 \\]\n\\[ 125 - 100 = x \\]\n\\[ x = 25 \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money Nigel gave away is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",

So, the amount of money he had after giving some away is:\n\\[ 45 - x \\]\n\nNext, his mother gave him $80 more. Therefore, the amount of money Nigel has now is:\n\\[ (45 - x) + 80 = 125 - x \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the amount of money Nigel has now is $10 more than twice the amount he originally had. The original amount he had was $45, so twice the original amount is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 45 = 90 \\]\n\nAdding $10 to this amount gives:\n\\[ 90 + 10 = 100 \\]\n\nSo, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation:\n\\[ 125 - x = 100 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 100 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 125 - x - 100 = 100 - 100 \\]\n\\[ 25 - x = 0 \\]\n\\[ 25 = x \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Nigel gave away is:\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]",
