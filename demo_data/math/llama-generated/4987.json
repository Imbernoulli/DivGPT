The products are very delicate and must be carefully packed, so partially filled boxes can’t be shipped. Steven has three trucks that can be sent on each delivery. Each truck can carry a load of no more than 2,000 pounds of cargo. Some of the boxes weigh 10 pounds after being packed, and some of the boxes weigh 40 pounds when packed. Steven’s customer has ordered equal quantities of both the lighter and heavier products. How many boxes of products can Steven ship to his customer in each delivery?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many boxes of products Steven can ship to his customer in each delivery, we need to consider the following information:\n\n1.

The total load capacity for all three trucks combined is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2000 = 6000 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n4. Steven’s customer has ordered equal quantities of both the lighter and heavier products. Let \\( x \\) be the number of 10-pound boxes and \\( x \\) be the number of 40-pound boxes.\n\nThe total weight of the shipment is the sum of the weights of all the boxes:\n\\[\n10x + 40x = 50x \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nWe need this total weight to be less than or equal to the total load capacity:\n\\[\n50x \\leq 6000\n\\]\n\nTo find the maximum value of \\( x \\), we solve the inequality by dividing both sides by 50:\n\\[\nx \\leq \\frac{6000}{50} = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Steven can ship up to 120 boxes of each type of product. The total number of boxes he can ship in each delivery is:\n\\[\n120 + 120 = 240\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum number of boxes of products Steven can ship to his customer in each delivery is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",

Steven has three trucks, and each truck can carry a maximum of 2,000 pounds. The boxes come in two weights: 10 pounds and 40 pounds. Since the customer has ordered equal quantities of both types of boxes, let's denote the number of 10-pound boxes by \\( x \\) and the number of 40-pound boxes by \\( x \\). Therefore, the total weight of the boxes in one delivery is given by:\n\n\\[ 10x + 40x = 50x \\]\n\nSince there are three trucks, the total weight that can be carried by all three trucks is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 2000 = 6000 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nWe need to find the maximum value of \\( x \\) such that the total weight does not exceed 6000 pounds:\n\n\\[ 50x \\leq 6000 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the inequality by 50:\n\n\\[ x \\leq \\frac{6000}{50} = 120 \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of 10-pound boxes that Steven can ship in each delivery is 120, and the maximum number of 40-pound boxes that Steven can ship in each delivery is also 120. The total number of boxes kvinde in each delivery is:\n\n\\[ 120 + 120 = 240 \\]\n\nThus, the number of boxes of products Steven can ship to his customer in each delivery is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]",
        "To determine how many boxes Steven can ship to his customer in each delivery, we need to consider the constraints of the trucks and the weights of the boxes. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the total weight capacity of the trucks:**\n   Each truck can carry a maximum of 2,000 pounds. Since Steven has three trucks, the total weight capacity for all three trucks is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2000 = 6000 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the weight of the boxes:**\n   - Some boxes weigh 10 pounds.\n   - Some boxes weigh 40 pounds.\n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of 10-pound boxes and \\( x \\) be the number of 40-pound boxes (since the customer has ordered equal quantities of both types of boxes).\n\n3. **Set up the equation for the total weight:**\n   The total weight of the boxes Steven ships is the sum of the weights of the 10-pound boxes and the 40-pound boxes:\n   \\[\n   10x + 40x = 50x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set up the inequality for the total weight capacity:**\n   The total weight of the boxes must not exceed the total weight capacity of the trucks:\n   \\[\n   50x \\leq 6000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   To find the maximum number of boxes of each type Steven can ship, solve the inequality for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x \\leq \\frac{6000}{50} = 120\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total number of boxes:**\n   Since \\( x \\) represents the number of each type of box and there are two types (10-pound and 40-pound), the total number of boxes Steven can ship is:\n   \\[\n   2x = 2 \\times 120 = 240\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of boxes Steven can ship to his customer in each delivery is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",

Therefore, for three trucks, the total capacity is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 2000 = 6000 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Set Up the Inequality:**\n   - The total weight of the boxes must be less than or equal to the total capacity of the three trucks:\n     \\[\n     50x \\leq 6000\n     \\]\n\n7. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Divide both sides of the inequality by 50:\n     \\[\n     x \\leq \\frac{6000}{50} = 120\n     \\]\n\n8. **Determine the Total Number of Boxes:**\n   - Since \\( x = y \\), the total number of boxes is:\n     \\[\n     x + y = x + x = 2x\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( x = 120 \\):\n     \\[\n     2x = 2 \\times 120 = 240\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Steven can ship \\(\\boxed{240}\\) boxes of products to his customer in each delivery.",
