Since there are 365 days in a year, we multiply the number of years by the number of days per year:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ years} \\times 365 \\text{ days/year} = 1095 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of pictures John has taken:**\n   John takes 10 pictures every day. Therefore, we multiply the number of days by the number of pictures per day:\n   \\[\n   1095 \\text{ days} \\times 10 \\text{ pictures/day} = 10950 \\text{ pictures}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of memory cards needed:**\n   Each memory card can store 50 images. To find the number of memory cards required, we divide the total number of pictures by the capacity of each memory card:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10950 \\text{ pictures}}{50 \\text{ pictures/memory card}} = 219 \\text{ memory cards}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of the memory cards:**\n   Each memory card costs $60. Therefore, we multiply the number of memory cards by the cost per memory card:\n   \\[\n   219 \\text{ memory cards} \\times 60 \\text{ dollars/memory card} = 13140 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount John spends on memory cards is \\(\\boxed{13140}\\).",
