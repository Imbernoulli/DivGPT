        "To determine how many more points Sammy, Gab, and Cher have compared to their opponent, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Gab's score.\n2. Calculate Cher's score.\n3. Find the total score of Sammy, Gab, and Cher.\n4. Determine how many more points they have than their opponent.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Gab's score. Gab scored twice as many points as Sammy. Since Sammy scored 20 points, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Gab's score} = 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate Cher's score. Cher scored twice as many points as Gab. Since Gab scored 40 points, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Cher's score} = 2 \\times 40 = 80 \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total score of Sammy, Gab, and Cher. We add their individual scores together:\n\\[ \\text{Total score} = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \\]\n\nFinally, we determine how many more points they have than their opponent. Their opponent scored 85 points, so we subtract their opponent's score from their total score:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 140 - 85 = 55 \\]\n\nTherefore, Sammy, Gab, and Cher have \\(\\boxed{55}\\) more points than their opponent.",
