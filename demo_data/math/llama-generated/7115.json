He counts out the seeds as he throws them. He throws 20 seeds to the birds on the left. He throws twice as much to the bigger group of birds on the right. Some more birds flutter over to join the others for lunch and Mike throws 30 more seeds for them. If Mike has 30 seeds left to feed the last of the birds, how many seeds did Mike start with?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Since he threw 20 seeds to the birds on the left, he throws \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) seeds to the birds on the right.\n3. Mike throws 30 more seeds to some more birds that flutter over.\n4. Mike has 30 seeds left to feed the last of the birds.\n\nNow, we add up all the seeds he has thrown and the seeds he has left:\n\\[\n20 + 40 + 30 + 30 = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mike started with \\(\\boxed{120}\\) seeds.",
