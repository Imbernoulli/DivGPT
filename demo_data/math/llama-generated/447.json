        "To determine how many puzzle pieces are missing, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pieces placed on the border:**\n   The border consists of 75 pieces.\n\n2. **Determine the number of pieces Trevor placed:**\n   Trevor placed 105 pieces.\n\n3. **Determine the number of pieces Joe placed:**\n   Joe placed three times the number of pieces as Trevor. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 105 = 315\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of pieces placed by both Trevor and Joe:**\n   We add the pieces placed by Trevor, Joe, and the border:\n   \\[\n   75 + 105 + 315\n   \\]\n\n5. **Perform the addition:**\n   \\[\n   75 + 105 = 180\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   180 + 315 = 495\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the number of missing pieces:**\n   The puzzle has a total of 500 pieces. We subtract the number of pieces already placed from the total number of pieces:\n   \\[\n   500 - 495 = 5\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of puzzle pieces missing is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

Joe placed three times the number of pieces as Trevor:\n\\[ \\text{Pieces placed by Joe} = 3 \\times 105 = 315 \\]\n\nNext, we add the pieces placed by Trevor, Joe, and the border:\n\\[ \\text{Total pieces placed} = 105 + 315 + 75 = 495 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of pieces placed from the total number of pieces in the puzzle to find out how many pieces are missing:\n\\[ \\text{Missing pieces} = 500 - 495 = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of puzzle pieces missing is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine how many puzzle pieces are missing, we need to calculate the total number of pieces that have been placed so far and then subtract this from the total number of pieces in the puzzle.\n\n1. First, we know that the border consists of 75 pieces.\n2. Trevor placed 105 pieces.\n3. Joe placed three times the number of pieces as Trevor. Therefore, Joe placed \\(3 \\times 105 = 315\\) pieces.\n\nNext, we add up all the pieces that have been placed:\n\\[75 + 105 + 315 = 495\\]\n\nThe total number of pieces in the puzzle is 500. To find out how many pieces are missing, we subtract the number of pieces that have been placed from the total number of pieces:\n\\[500 - 495 = 5\\]\n\nThus, the number of puzzle pieces missing is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine how many puzzle pieces are missing, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of puzzle pieces placed by Trevor and Joe.\n2. Add the number of pieces placed by Trevor and Joe to the number of pieces on the border.\n3. Subtract this total from the total number of pieces in the puzzle.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of pieces placed by Joe. Since Joe placed three times the number of pieces as Trevor, we multiply Trevor's number of pieces by 3:\n\\[ 105 \\times 3 = 315 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of pieces placed by Trevor and Joe to the number of pieces on the border:\n\\[ 105 + 315 + 75 = 495 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of pieces placed from the total number of pieces in the puzzle:\n\\[ 500 - 495 = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of puzzle pieces missing is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
