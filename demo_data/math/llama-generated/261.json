        "To determine the total cost of Trevor's taxi ride downtown, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the cost of a Lyft ride:**\n   - We know the Uber ride costs $22.\n   - The Uber ride costs $3 more than a Lyft ride.\n   - Let \\( L \\) represent the cost of a Lyft ride.\n   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     22 = L + 3\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( L \\):\n     \\[\n     L = 22 - 3 = 19\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the cost of a taxi ride:**\n   - We know the Lyft ride costs $4 more than a taxi ride.\n   - Let \\( T \\) represent the cost of a taxi ride.\n   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     19 = T + 4\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( T \\):\n     \\[\n     T = 19 - 4 = 15\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the tip:**\n   - Trevor tips the taxi driver 20% of the original cost of the ride.\n   - The original cost of the taxi ride is $15.\n   - Therefore, the tip is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Tip} = 0.20 \\times 15 = 3\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the total cost of the ride:**\n   - The total cost of the ride is the original cost plus the tip.\n   - Therefore, the total cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cost} = 15 + 3 = 18\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of Trevor's taxi ride downtown is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
        "To determine the total cost of Trevor's taxi ride downtown, we first need to find the cost of a taxi ride. We know the following relationships between the costs of the rides:\n\n1. The Uber ride costs $22.\n2. The Uber ride costs $3 more than the Lyft ride.\n3. The Lyft ride costs $4 more than the taxi ride.\n\nLet's denote the cost of the taxi ride by \\( T \\). Then, the cost of the Lyft ride is \\( T + 4 \\) and the cost of the Uber ride is \\( (T + 4) + 3 = T + 7 \\). We know the Uber ride costs $22, so we can set up the equation:\n\\[ T + 7 = 22 \\]\n\nTo find \\( T \\), we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ T = 22 - 7 \\]\n\\[ T = 15 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of the taxi ride is $15. Trevor tips the taxi driver 20% of the original cost of the ride. To find the tip, we calculate 20% of $15:\n\\[ \\text{Tip} = 0.20 \\times 15 = 3 \\]\n\nThe total cost of the ride is the original cost plus the tip:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 15 + 3 = 18 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the ride downtown is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

Calculate the tip based on the cost of the taxi ride.\n4. Add the tip to the cost of the taxi ride to get the total cost.\n\nFirst, we know the cost of an Uber ride is $22. Since an Uber ride costs $3 more than a Lyft ride, we can find the cost of a Lyft ride by subtracting $3 from the cost of the Uber ride:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of a Lyft ride} = 22 - 3 = 19\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that a Lyft ride costs $4 more than a taxi ride. Therefore, we can find the cost of a taxi ride by subtracting $4 from the cost of the Lyft ride:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of a taxi ride} = 19 - 4 = 15\n\\]\n\nTrevor tips the taxi driver 20% of the original cost of the ride. To find the tip, we calculate 20% of $15:\n\\[\n\\text{Tip} = 0.20 \\times 15 = 3\n\\]\n\nThe total cost of the ride is the sum of the original cost of the ride and the tip:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 15 + 3 = 18\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost of the ride downtown is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

Therefore, we can find the cost of a taxi ride by subtracting $4 from the cost of a Lyft ride:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of a taxi ride} = 19 - 4 = 15\n\\]\n\nTrevor tips the taxi driver 20% of the original cost of the ride. To find the tip, we calculate 20% of $15:\n\\[\n\\text{Tip} = 0.20 \\times 15 = 3\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the tip to the original cost of the taxi ride to find the total cost of the ride:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of the ride} = 15 + 3 = 18\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost of the ride downtown is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
