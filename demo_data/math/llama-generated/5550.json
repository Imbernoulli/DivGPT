        "To determine how many rooms Grant's apartment has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many rooms Heidi's apartment has.\n2. Use the number of rooms in Heidi's apartment to find out how many rooms Grant's apartment has.\n\nFirst, we know that Danielle's apartment has 6 rooms. Heidi's apartment has 3 times as many rooms as Danielle's apartment. Therefore, we can calculate the number of rooms in Heidi's apartment as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of rooms in Heidi's apartment} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of rooms in Danielle's apartment} = 3 \\times 6 = 18\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Grant's apartment has \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\) as many rooms as Heidi's apartment.
