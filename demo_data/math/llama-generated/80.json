        "To determine the number of gigabytes still available on the USB drive, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total capacity of the USB drive.\n2. Calculate the amount of space that is already used.\n3. Subtract the used space from the total capacity to find the available space.\n\nThe total capacity of the USB drive is 16 GB. Since 50% of the USB drive is already busy, we need to calculate 50% of 16 GB.\n\nFirst, convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:\n\\[ 50\\% = \\frac{50}{100} = 0.5 \\]\n\nNext, multiply the total capacity by this decimal to find the used space:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ GB} \\times 0.5 = 8 \\text{ GB} \\]\n\nNow, subtract the used space from the total capacity to find the available space:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ GB} - 8 \\text{ GB} = 8 \\text{ GB} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of gigabytes still available is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

Subtract the used space from the total capacity of the USB drive.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of space that is already used. Since 50% of the 16 GB is used, we can find this by multiplying 16 GB by 50% (or 0.50):\n\n\\[\n16 \\text{ GB} \\times 0.50 = 8 \\text{ GB}\n\\]\n\nSo, 8 GB of the USB drive is already used. Next, we subtract the used space from the total capacity to find out how much space is still available:\n\n\\[\n16 \\text{ GB} - 8 \\text{ GB} = 8 \\text{ GB}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of gigabytes still available is \\boxed{8}.",
        "To determine the number of gigabytes still available on a 16 GB USB drive where 50% is already used, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of space that is already used.\n2. Subtract the used space from the total capacity to find the available space.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of space that is already used.\nThe USB drive has a total capacity of 16 GB, and 50% of it is used.
