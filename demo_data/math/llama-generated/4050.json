        "To determine how old Emma will be when her sister is 56, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the current age of Emma's sister.\n2. Calculate the age difference between Emma and her sister.\n3. Use the age difference to find out how old Emma will be when her sister is 56.\n\nFirst, let's find the current age of Emma's sister. Emma is currently 7 years old, and her sister is 9 years older than her. Therefore, her sister's current age is:\n\\[ 7 + 9 = 16 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the age difference between Emma and her sister. Since her sister is 9 years older than Emma, the age difference is 9 years. This age difference will remain constant over time.\n\nNow, we need to find out how old Emma will be when her sister is 56. Since her sister is currently 16 years old, we need to determine how many years it will take for her sister to reach 56 years old. This can be calculated as:\n\\[ 56 - 16 = 40 \\]\n\nIn 40 years, Emma will also be 40 years older than she is now. Since Emma is currently 7 years old, her age in 40 years will be:\n\\[ 7 + 40 = 47 \\]\n\nTherefore, Emma will be \\(\\boxed{47}\\) years old when her sister is 56.",
