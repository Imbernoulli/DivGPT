        "To determine the total deposit Hans has to pay for the restaurant reservation, we need to break down the cost into its components: the flat fee, the cost for the adults, and the cost for the children.\n\nFirst, we identify the number of adults and children in Hans's party. The total number of people is 12, and two of them are children. Therefore, the number of adults is:\n\\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost for the adults. The cost per adult is $3, so the total cost for the adults is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the cost for the children. The cost per child is $1, so the total cost for the children is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\]\n\nNow, we add up all the costs to find the total deposit. The deposit consists of a flat fee of $20, the cost for the adults, and the cost for the children:\n\\[ 20 + 30 + 2 = 52 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total deposit Hans has to pay is:\n\\[ \\boxed{52} \\]",
        "To determine the total deposit Hans has to pay, we need to break down the cost into the fixed deposit and the variable costs for the adults and children. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Identify the total number of people in Hans's party, which is 12.\n2. Determine the number of children in the party. Since two of the people are his kid cousins, there are 2 children.\n3. Calculate the number of adults in the party by subtracting the number of children from the total number of people:\n   \\[\n   12 - 2 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, there are 10 adults.\n4. The fixed deposit is $20.\n5. The cost per adult is $3. Therefore, the total cost for the adults is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 3 = 30\n   \\]\n6. The cost per child is $1. Therefore, the total cost for the children is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 1 = 2\n   \\]\n7. Add the fixed deposit, the total cost for the adults, and the total cost for the children to find the total deposit:\n   \\[\n   20 + 30 + 2 = 52\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total deposit Hans has to pay is \\(\\boxed{52}\\).",
