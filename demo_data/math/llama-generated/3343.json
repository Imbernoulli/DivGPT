        "To determine the total number of hours Emery's family traveled, we need to break down the trip into two segments and calculate the time spent on each segment.\n\n1. **First Segment:**\n   - Distance: 100 miles\n   - Time: 1 hour\n\n2. **Second Segment:**\n   - Distance: 300 miles\n   - Speed: To find the speed for the second segment, we need to use the information given for the first segment.
