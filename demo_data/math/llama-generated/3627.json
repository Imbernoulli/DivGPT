        "To determine how much change Allen received, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the pizzas.\n2. Determine the tip amount.\n3. Find the total amount paid (cost of pizzas + tip).\n4.

        "First, we calculate the total cost of the five boxes of pizza. Since each box costs $7, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:\n\\[\n5 \\times 7 = 35\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the pizzas is $35.\n\nNext, we need to find the amount of the tip. The tip is \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) of the total cost of the order. Therefore, we multiply the total cost by \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\):\n\\[\n35 \\times \\frac{1}{7} = 5\n\\]\nSo, the tip is $5.\n\nTo find the total amount Allen paid, we add the total cost of the pizzas to the tip:\n\\[\n35 + 5 = 40\n\\]\nSo, the total amount Allen paid is $40.\n\nFinally, we determine the change Allen received by subtracting the total amount paid from the $100 he gave the delivery man:\n\\[\n100 - 40 = 60\n\\]\nSo, the change Allen received is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",

The tip is \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) of the total cost of the pizzas:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{7} \\times 35 = 5\n\\]\nSo, the tip is $5.\n\nNow, we add the cost of the pizzas and the tip to find the total amount paid:\n\\[\n35 + 5 = 40\n\\]\nSo, the total amount paid is $40.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount paid from the $100 given to find the change:\n\\[\n100 - 40 = 60\n\\]\nSo, the change Allen received is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",

Subtract the total amount paid from the amount given to find the change.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the pizzas.**\nAllen ordered five boxes of pizza, and each box costs $7.\n\\[\n5 \\times 7 = 35\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the pizzas is $35.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the tip.**\nThe tip is \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) of the total cost of the pizzas.\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{7} \\times 35 = 5\n\\]\nSo, the tip is $5.\n\n**Step 3: Add the total cost of the pizzas and the tip to find the total amount paid.**\n\\[\n35 + 5 = 40\n\\]\nSo, the total amount paid is $40.\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the total amount paid from the amount given to find the change.**\nAllen gave the delivery man $100.\n\\[\n100 - 40 = 60\n\\]\nSo, the change Allen received is $60.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{60}\n\\]"
