        "To determine how much Jon spends on coffee in April, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the daily cost of Jon's coffee.\n2. Determine the number of days in April.\n3. Multiply the daily cost by the number of days in April.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the daily cost of Jon's coffee.**\n\nJon buys 2 coffees each day, and each coffee costs $2. Therefore, the daily cost is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ coffees/day} \\times \\$2/\\text{coffee} = \\$4/\\text{day} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of days in April.**\n\nApril has 30 days.\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the daily cost by the number of days in April.**\n\nTo find the total cost for April, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in April:\n\\[ \\$4/\\text{day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = \\$120 \\]\n\nThus, Jon spends \\(\\boxed{120}\\) dollars in April.",
        "To determine how much Jon spends on coffee in April, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the daily cost of coffee.\n2.
