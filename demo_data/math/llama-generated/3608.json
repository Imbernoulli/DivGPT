        "To determine the total number of beads Charley pulled out, we need to calculate the number of black beads and the number of white beads he took out separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of black beads Charley pulled out. The bag initially contains 90 black beads, and Charley pulls out \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of them. Therefore, the number of black beads he pulls out is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} \\times 90 = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of white beads Charley pulled out. The bag initially contains 51 white beads, and Charley pulls out \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of them. Therefore, the number of white beads he pulls out is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 51 = 17\n\\]\n\nTo find the total number of beads Charley pulled out, we add the number of black beads and the number of white beads:\n\\[\n15 + 17 = 32\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of beads Charley pulled out is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",

So, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} \\times 90 = 15\n\\]\nTherefore, Charley pulled out 15 black beads.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of white beads Charley pulled out. The bag initially contains 51 white beads, and Charley pulls out \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of them. So, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 51 = 17\n\\]\nTherefore, Charley pulled out 17 white beads.\n\nTo find the total number of beads Charley pulled out, we add the number of black beads and white beads together:\n\\[\n15 + 17 = 32\n\\]\nThus, the total number of beads Charley pulled out is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
