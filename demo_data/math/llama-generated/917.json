Today, two-thirds of the students sat in the cafeteria, while the remainder sat at the covered picnic tables outside. But some yellow-jackets were attracted to their food, and so one-third of the students outside jumped up and ran inside to the cafeteria, while 3 of the students in the cafeteria went outside to see what all the fuss was about.

        "Let's start by determining how many students initially sat in the cafeteria and how many sat outside.

        "To determine how many students are now in the cafeteria, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial number of students who sat in the cafeteria and outside.\n2. Determine how many students who were outside ran inside.\n3. Determine how many students who were in the cafeteria went outside.\n4. Calculate the new number of students in the cafeteria after these changes.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial number of students in the cafeteria and outside. There are 90 students in total, and two-thirds of them sat in the cafeteria:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students in the cafeteria initially} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 90 = 60\n\\]\nThe remaining students sat outside:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students outside initially} = 90 - 60 = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many students who were outside ran inside. One-third of the students outside ran inside:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students who ran inside} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 30 = 10\n\\]\nSo, the number of students who remained outside is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students who remained outside} = 30 - 10 = 20\n\\]\n\nThen, we determine how many students who were in the cafeteria went outside. Three students went outside:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students who went outside} = 3\n\\]\nSo, the number of students who remained in the cafeteria is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students who remained in the cafeteria} = 60 - 3 = 57\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of students who ran inside to the number of students who remained in the cafeteria to get the new total number of students in the cafeteria:\n\\[\n\\text{New number of students in the cafeteria} = 57 + 10 = 67\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students now in the cafeteria is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{67}\n\\]",
