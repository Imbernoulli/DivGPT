The time it takes for the hare to complete the race is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_{\\text{hare}} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{20 \\text{ feet}}{10 \\text{ feet/second}} = 2 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for the turtle to finish the race. The turtle crawls at a speed of 1 foot per second. The time it takes for the turtle to complete the race is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_{\\text{turtle}} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{20 \\text{ feet}}{1 \\text{ foot/second}} = 20 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nThe difference in time between the turtle and the hare is:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in time} = \\text{Time}_{\\text{turtle}} - \\text{Time}_{\\text{hare}} = 20 \\text{ seconds} - 2 \\text{ seconds} = 18 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the turtle needs a head start of 18 seconds to finish the race in a tie with the hare.
