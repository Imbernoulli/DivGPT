Each week, she interviews three singers, one at a time.  The first interview segment is always twice as long as the other two segments combined, and the third interview segment is always half as long as the second. If the third segment is 10 minutes long, how many minutes long is the entire show?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total length of Debra's country music radio show, we need to find the lengths of each interview segment and then sum them up.\n\nLet's denote the length of the second interview segment by \\( x \\) minutes. According to the problem, the third interview segment is half as long as the second segment, so the length of the third segment is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) minutes. We are given that the third segment is 10 minutes long. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the length of the second interview segment is 20 minutes. The length of the third interview segment is 10 minutes. The first interview segment is twice as long as the other two segments combined. The combined length of the second and third segments is:\n\n\\[\n20 + 10 = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the first interview segment is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 30 = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the lengths of all three interview segments to find the total length of the show:\n\n\\[\n60 + 20 + 10 = 90 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the entire show is \\(\\boxed{90}\\) minutes long.",
