        "To determine the number of pufferfish in the aquarium exhibit, we start by defining variables for the number of swordfish and pufferfish. Let's denote the number of pufferfish as \\( p \\). According to the problem, there are five times as many swordfish as pufferfish. Therefore, the number of swordfish can be expressed as \\( 5p \\).\n\nThe total number of fish in the exhibit is given as 90. This total is the sum of the number of swordfish and the number of pufferfish. We can write this relationship as:\n\\[ p + 5p = 90 \\]\n\nCombining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 6p = 90 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( p \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\\[ p = \\frac{90}{6} = 15 \\]\n\nThus, the number of pufferfish is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",

        "To determine the number of pufferfish in the aquarium exhibit, we start by defining variables for the quantities of each type of fish. Let's denote the number of pufferfish by \\( p \\). According to the problem, there are five times as many swordfish as pufferfish, so the number of swordfish can be expressed as \\( 5p \\).\n\nThe total number of fish in the exhibit is given as 90. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of fish:\n\n\\[\np + 5p = 90\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n6p = 90\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( p \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{90}{6} = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of pufferfish is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
