        "First, we need to determine how much each family member must contribute towards the vacation cost. Since the vacation costs $1,000 and there are five members in the family, each member must contribute:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1000}{5} = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much Jules earns from walking dogs. He charges $2 to start each walk and $1.25 per block. If he walks 20 dogs, he earns $2 for each dog, so the total earnings from starting the walks is:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 2 = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nLet \\( b \\) be the total number of blocks Jules walks. The earnings from walking the dogs is $1.25 per block, so the total earnings from walking the dogs is:\n\n\\[\n1.25b \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThe total earnings from both starting the walks and walking the dogs is:\n\n\\[\n40 + 1.25b\n\\]\n\nSince Jules needs to earn $200, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n40 + 1.25b = 200\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( b \\), we first subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n1.25b = 160\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 1.25:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{160}{1.25} = 128\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jules has to walk a total of \\(\\boxed{128}\\) blocks.",

Therefore, each member's contribution is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1000}{5} = 200\n   \\]\n   So, Jules needs to contribute $200.\n\n2. **Determine the total earnings from walking dogs:**\n   Jules charges $2 to start each walk and $1.25 per block.

So, we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   40 + 1.25b = 200\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( b \\):**\n   First, subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   1.25b = 160\n   \\]\n   Next, divide both sides by 1.25:\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{160}{1.25} = 128\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jules has to walk a total of \\(\\boxed{128}\\) blocks.",
