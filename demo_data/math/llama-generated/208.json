Determine the amount of money Cathy's mom sent her.\n4. Calculate the total amount of money Cathy has after receiving money from her parents.\n\nFirst, we know that Cathy initially has $12 left in her wallet.\n\nNext, her dad sent her $25. So, we add $25 to the initial amount:\n\\[ 12 + 25 = 37 \\]\n\nThen, her mom sent her twice the amount her dad sent her. Since her dad sent her $25, her mom sent her:\n\\[ 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\]\n\nNow, we add the amount her mom sent her to the total amount after receiving money from her dad:\n\\[ 37 + 50 = 87 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Cathy has now is:\n\\[ \\boxed{87} \\]"
