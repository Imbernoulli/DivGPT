        "To determine the total number of stickers placed in the sticker book, we need to calculate the number of stickers each person has and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we know that Karl has 25 stickers.

So, we add 20 to the number of stickers Karl has:\n\\[ \\text{Ryan's stickers} = 25 + 20 = 45 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Ben has 10 fewer stickers than Ryan. So, we subtract 10 from the number of stickers Ryan has:\n\\[ \\text{Ben's stickers} = 45 - 10 = 35 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of stickers each person has to find the total number of stickers:\n\\[ \\text{Total stickers} = \\text{Karl's stickers} + \\text{Ryan's stickers} + \\text{Ben's stickers} = 25 + 45 + 35 \\]\n\nWe can simplify this by adding the numbers step by step:\n\\[ 25 + 45 = 70 \\]\n\\[ 70 + 35 = 105 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of stickers they placed in the sticker book is:\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]",

Calculate the number of stickers Ben has.\n3. Add the number of stickers Karl, Ryan, and Ben have together.\n\nFirst, we know that Karl has 25 stickers. Ryan has 20 more stickers than Karl. Therefore, we can calculate the number of stickers Ryan has as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Ryan's stickers} = \\text{Karl's stickers} + 20 = 25 + 20 = 45 \\]\n\nNext, Ben has 10 fewer stickers than Ryan. Therefore, we can calculate the number of stickers Ben has as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Ben's stickers} = \\text{Ryan's stickers} - 10 = 45 - 10 = 35 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of stickers Karl, Ryan, and Ben have together:\n\\[ \\text{Total stickers} = \\text{Karl's stickers} + \\text{Ryan's stickers} + \\text{Ben's stickers} = 25 + 45 + 35 \\]\n\nAdding these together step by step:\n\\[ 25 + 45 = 70 \\]\n\\[ 70 + 35 = 105 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of stickers they placed in the sticker book is:\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of stickers Karl, Ryan, and Ben have, we need to calculate the number of stickers each person has and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we know that Karl has 25 stickers.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many stickers Ryan has. Ryan has 20 more stickers than Karl. Therefore, we add 20 to the number of stickers Karl has:\n\\[ 25 + 20 = 45 \\]\nSo, Ryan has 45 stickers.\n\nThen, we need to find out how many stickers Ben has. Ben has 10 fewer stickers than Ryan. Therefore, we subtract 10 from the number of stickers Ryan has:\n\\[ 45 - 10 = 35 \\]\nSo, Ben has 35 stickers.\n\nNow, we add the number of stickers Karl, Ryan, and Ben have to find the total number of stickers:\n\\[ 25 + 45 + 35 = 105 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of stickers they placed in the sticker book is \\(\\boxed{105}\\).",
