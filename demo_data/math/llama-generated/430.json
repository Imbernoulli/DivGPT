        "To determine how much change Mary will receive, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract that from the amount she paid. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Identify the number of adults and children:\n   - Mary is an adult, so there is 1 adult.\n   - Mary has 3 children, so there are 3 children.\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the adult ticket:\n   - The cost of one adult ticket is $2.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the adult ticket is \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\) dollars.\n\n3. Calculate the cost of the children's tickets:\n   - The cost of one child's ticket is $1.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the children's tickets is \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\) dollars.\n\n4. Calculate the total cost of all the tickets:\n   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the adult ticket and the cost of the children's tickets.\n   - Therefore, the total cost is \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) dollars.\n\n5.
