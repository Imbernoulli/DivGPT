To find out how many 500 milliliter portions are in 3000 milliliters, we divide 3000 by 500:\n\n\\[ 3000 \\text{ milliliters} \\div 500 \\text{ milliliters/portion} = 6 \\text{ portions} \\]\n\nSince Sandy drinks one portion every 2 hours, the total time it will take her to drink 6 portions is:\n\n\\[ 6 \\text{ portions} \\times 2 \\text{ hours/portion} = 12 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, Sandy will be able to drink a total of 3 liters of water after \\(\\boxed{12}\\) hours.",
        "To determine how many hours it will take Sandy to drink 3 liters of water, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the total water goal from liters to milliliters.\n2. Determine how much water Sandy drinks in one cycle (every 2 hours).\n3. Calculate how many cycles are needed to reach the total water goal.\n4. Determine the total time taken.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the total water goal from liters to milliliters.**\n\nSandy's goal is to drink 3 liters of water. Since 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, we have:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ liters} = 3 \\times 1000 \\text{ milliliters} = 3000 \\text{ milliliters} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much water Sandy drinks in one cycle (every 2 hours).**\n\nSandy drinks 500 milliliters of water every 2 hours. So, in one cycle, she drinks:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ milliliters} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many cycles are needed to reach the total water goal.**\n\nTo find out how many cycles are needed to drink 3000 milliliters, we divide the total water goal by the amount of water drawn in one cycle:\n\\[ \\frac{3000 \\text{ milliliters}}{500 \\text{ milliliters/cycle}} = 6 \\text{ cycles} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the total time taken.**\n\nSince each cycle takes 2 hours, the total time taken to complete 6 cycles is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ cycles} \\times 2 \\text{ hours/cycle} = 12 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, Sandy will be able to drink a total of 3 liters of water after \\boxed{12} hours.",
        "To determine how many hours it will take Sandy to drink a total of 3 liters of water, we start by converting the total water goal into milliliters.
