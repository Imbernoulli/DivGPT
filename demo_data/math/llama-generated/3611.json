        "To determine the age of the tree when it is 23 feet tall, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the initial conditions:**\n   - The tree is initially 1 year old.\n   - The tree is initially 5 feet tall.\n\n2. **Determine the growth rate:**\n   - The tree gains 3 feet per year.\n\n3. **Set up the equation:**\n   - Let \\( y \\) be the age of the tree in years.\n   - The height of the tree after \\( y \\) years can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Height} = 5 + 3(y - 1)\n     \\]\n   - This equation accounts for the initial height (5 feet) and the growth over the \\( y - 1 \\) years since it was planted.\n\n4. **Solve for \\( y \\) when the height is 23 feet:**\n   \\[\n   23 = 5 + 3(y - 1)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the equation:**\n   \\[\n   23 = 5 + 3y - 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   23 = 2 + 3y\n   \\]\n\n6. **Isolate \\( 3y \\):**\n   \\[\n   23 - 2 = 3y\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   21 = 3y\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solve for \\( y \\):**\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{21}{3}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 7\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the tree is \\(\\boxed{7}\\) years old when it is 23 feet tall.",
        "To determine how old the tree is when it reaches 23 feet tall, we start by noting the initial conditions and the growth rate of the tree.\n\n1. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - The tree is 1 year old.\n   - The tree is 5 feet tall.\n\n2. **Growth Rate:**\n   - The tree gains 3 feet per year.\n\nWe need to find out how many years it takes for the tree to grow from 5 feet to 23 feet. Let's denote the number of years it takes to reach 23 feet as \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   - The height of the tree after \\( x \\) years can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Initial height} + (\\text{Growth rate} \\times x)\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the given values:\n     \\[\n     5 + 3x\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( x \\):**\n   - We set the height equal to 23 feet:\n     \\[\n     5 + 3x = 23\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 5 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     3x = 18\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 3:\n     \\[\n     x = 6\n     \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Total Age:**\n   - The tree is initially 1 year old.\n   - It takes 6 additional years to reach 23 feet tall.\n   - Therefore, the total age of the tree is:\n     \\[\n     1 + 6 = 7\n     \\]\n\nThus, the tree is \\(\\boxed{7}\\) years old when it is 23 feet tall."
