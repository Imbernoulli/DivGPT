The time her friend spends driving is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_{\\text{friend}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ miles}}{20 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's add the time spent on breaks. They plan on taking 2 breaks, each lasting 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, each break is:\n\\[\n\\frac{30 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes per hour}} = 0.5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nSo, the total time spent on breaks is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_{\\text{breaks}} = 2 \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the time Jenna spends driving, the time her friend spends driving, and the time spent on breaks to get the total time spent on the road trip:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\text{Time}_{\\text{Jenna}} + \\text{Time}_{\\text{friend}} + \\text{Time}_{\\text{breaks}} = 4 \\text{ hours} + 5 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 10 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time they will spend on the road trip is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) hours.",
