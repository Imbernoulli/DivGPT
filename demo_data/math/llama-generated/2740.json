        "To determine the total number of boxes Tameka sold over the three days, we need to calculate the number of boxes she sold each day and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we know that on Friday, Tameka sold 40 boxes.\n\\[ \\text{Boxes sold on Friday} = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of boxes she sold on Saturday.

Since she sold 40 boxes on Friday, we calculate:\n\\[ 2 \\times 40 - 10 = 80 - 10 = 70 \\]\nSo, Tameka sold 70 boxes on Saturday.\n\nNext, let's find out how many boxes Tameka sold on Sunday.

Since she sold 40 boxes on Friday, we can calculate the number of boxes sold on Saturday as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 40 - 10 = 80 - 10 = 70\n\\]\nSo, Tameka sold 70 boxes on Saturday.\n\nNext, let's find out how many boxes Tameka sold on Sunday.

Since she sold 70 boxes on Saturday, we can calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{70}{2} = 35\n\\]\nSo, Tameka sold 35 boxes on Sunday.\n\nNow, we sum the number of boxes sold over the three days:\n\\[\n40 + 70 + 35 = 145\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of boxes Tameka sold over the three days is \\boxed{145}.",

The problem states that she sold half as many boxes on Sunday as she sold on Saturday. So, we calculate half of the number of boxes sold on Saturday:\n\\[ \\frac{70}{2} = 35 \\]\nSo, the number of boxes sold on Sunday is:\n\\[ 35 \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the number of boxes sold over the three days:\n\\[ 40 + 70 + 35 = 145 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of boxes Tameka sold over the three days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{145} \\]",
