Multiply that sum by 2 to get the weight of the dog.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the sum of the weights of the two cats. The weights of the cats are 7 pounds and 10 pounds. So, we add these two weights together:\n\\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out what twice this sum is. We do this by multiplying the sum by 2:\n\\[ 2 \\times 17 = 34 \\]\n\nTherefore, the weight of Christine's dog is \\(\\boxed{34}\\) pounds.",
