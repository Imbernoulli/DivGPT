        "To determine the total cost to plant the flowers, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Cost of the flowers**: The flowers cost $9.\n\n2. **Cost of the clay pot**: The clay pot costs $20 more than the flowers. Therefore, we add $20 to the cost of the flowers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of the clay pot} = 9 + 20 = 29\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of the bag of soil**: The bag of soil costs $2 less than the flowers.
