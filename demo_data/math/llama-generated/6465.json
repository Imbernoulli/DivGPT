        "To determine the cost for Tricia to buy enough bottles of iced coffee to last for 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of servings Tricia drinks in one day.\n2. Calculate the number of servings Tricia drinks in 2 weeks.\n3. Determine how many bottles of coffee she needs to buy.\n4. Calculate the total cost of the bottles.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of servings Tricia drinks in one day.**\n\nTricia drinks half a container of coffee each day. Since each container has 6 servings, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Servings per day} = \\frac{6 \\text{ servings}}{2} = 3 \\text{ servings}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of servings Tricia drinks in 2 weeks.**\n\nThere are 14 days in 2 weeks. Therefore, the total number of servings she drinks in 2 weeks is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total servings in 2 weeks} = 3 \\text{ servings/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 42 \\text{ servings}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many bottles of coffee she needs to buy.**\n\nEach bottle contains 6 servings. To find out how many bottles are needed for 42 servings, we divide:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of bottles} = \\frac{42 \\text{ servings}}{6 \\text{ servings/bottle}} = 7 \\text{ bottles}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the bottles.**\n\nEach bottle costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost for 7 bottles is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 7 \\text{ bottles} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/bottle} = 21 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost for Tricia to buy enough bottles to last for 2 weeks is \\boxed{21}.",
