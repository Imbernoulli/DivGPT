        "To determine the total number of filled water balloons Max and Zach have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of water balloons Max fills.\n2. Calculate the number of water balloons Zach fills.\n3. Add the number of water balloons filled by Max and Zach.\n4. Subtract the number of water balloons that pop.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of water balloons Max fills. Max fills water balloons for 30 minutes at a rate of 2 water balloons per minute. Therefore, the total number of water balloons Max fills is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes} \\times 2 \\text{ water balloons/minute} = 60 \\text{ water balloons} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of water balloons Zach fills. Zach fills water balloons for 40 minutes at a rate of 3 water balloons per minute. Therefore, the total number of water balloons Zach fills is:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ minutes} \\times 3 \\text{ water balloons/minute} = 120 \\text{ water balloons} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of water balloons filled by Max and Zach:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ water balloons} + 120 \\text{ water balloons} = 180 \\text{ water balloons} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of water balloons that pop. Since 10 water balloons pop, the total number of filled water balloons Max and Zach have is:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ water balloons} - 10 \\text{ water balloons} = 170 \\text{ water balloons} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of filled water balloons Max and Zach have is \\(\\boxed{170}\\).",

Max fills water balloons at a rate of 2 water balloons per minute for 30 minutes:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ water balloons/minute} \\times 30 \\text{ minutes} = 60 \\text{ water balloons} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of water balloons Zach fills. Zach fills water balloons at a rate of 3 water balloons per minute for 40 minutes:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ water balloons/minute} \\times 40 \\text{ minutes} = 120 \\text{ water balloons} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of water balloons filled by Max and Zach:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ water balloons} + 120 \\text{ water balloons} = 180 \\text{ water balloons} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of water balloons that pop. Since 10 water balloons pop, we have:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ water balloons} - 10 \\text{ water balloons} = 170 \\text{ water balloons} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of filled water balloons Max and Zach have is \\(\\boxed{170}\\).",
