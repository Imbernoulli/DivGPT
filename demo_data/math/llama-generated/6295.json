        "To determine how long it will take Jerry to make 9 quarts of cherry syrup, we need to break down the process into two main parts: picking the cherries and making the syrup.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of cherries needed for 9 quarts of syrup. Since Jerry needs 500 cherries per quart, we multiply 500 by 9:\n\\[\n500 \\times 9 = 4500 \\text{ cherries}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take Jerry to pick 4500 cherries. We know that it takes him 2 hours to pick 300 cherries. To find out how many hours it takes to pick one cherry, we divide 2 by 300:\n\\[\n2 \\div 300 = \\frac{2}{300} = \\frac{1}{150} \\text{ hours per cherry}\n\\]\n\nNow, we multiply the time it takes to pick one cherry by the total number of cherries needed:\n\\[\n4500 \\times \\frac{1}{150} = 30 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThis means it will take Jerry 30 hours to pick 4500 cherries. Additionally, it takes him 3 hours to make the syrup. Therefore, the total time it will take Jerry to make 9 quarts of syrup is:\n\\[\n30 + 3 = 33 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{33}\n\\]",
