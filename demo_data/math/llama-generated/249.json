Subtract the money跟不上 from the total cost to find out how much John spent.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of wigs John initially needed for all 3 plays:**\n   - Each play has 5 acts.\n   - John wears 2 wigs per act.\n   - Therefore, the number of wigs needed per play is \\(5 \\text{ acts} \\times 2 \\text{ wigs/act} = 10 \\text{ wigs}\\).\n   - Since John is performing in 3 plays, the total number of wigs needed is \\(3 \\text{ plays} \\times 10 \\text{ wigs/play} = 30 \\text{ wigs}\\).\n\n2. **Determine the cost of all the wigs:**\n   - Each wig costs $5.\n   - Therefore, the total cost of 30 wigs is \\(30 \\text{ wigs} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/wig} = 150 \\text{ dollars}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the amount of money John got back from selling the wigs for the play he dropped:**\n   - John drops one play, so he sells the wigs for that play.\n   - The number of wigs needed for one play is 10.\n   - He sells each wig for $4.\n   - Therefore, the amount of money he gets back is \\(10 \\text{ wigs} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars/wig} = 40 \\text{ dollars}\\).\n\n4. **Subtract the money retir americ from the total cost to find out how much John spent:**\n   - The total cost of the wigs is $150.\n   - The money he gets back is $40.\n   - Therefore, the amount of money he spent is \\(150 \\text{ dollars} - 40 \\text{ dollars} = 110 \\text{ dollars}\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",
