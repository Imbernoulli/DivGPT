        "To determine how many students wore blue lipstick, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of students who wore colored lipstick:**\n   - Half of the students who attended class wore colored lipstick.\n   - Total students attending class: 200\n   \\[\n   \\text{Students wearing colored lipstick} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 200 = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of students who wore red lipstick:**\n   - One quarter of the students who wore colored lipstick wore red lipstick.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Students wearing red lipstick} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of students who wore blue lipstick:**\n   - There were one-fifth as many students wearing blue lipstick as were wearing red lipstick.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Students wearing blue lipstick} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 25 = 5\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of students who wore blue lipstick is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."
