        "To determine the price of a single appetizer, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the entrees:**\n   Tim spent 80% of $50.00 on entrees.\n   \\[\n   0.80 \\times 50.00 = 40.00\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total cost of the appetizers:**\n   The remaining 20% of the $50.00 was spent on appetizers.\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 50.00 = 10.00\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the cost of a single appetizer:**\n   Tim bought 2 appetizers, and the total cost for both was $10.00. Therefore, the cost of one appetizer is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10.00}{2} = 5.00\n   \\]\n\nThus, the price of a single appetizer is \\(\\boxed{5.00}\\).",
        "To determine the price of a single appetizer, we start by calculating the total amount of money Tim spent on the entrees. Since 80% of the $50.00 went to the entrees, we can find this amount by multiplying $50.00 by 0.80:\n\n\\[\n0.80 \\times 50.00 = 40.00\n\\]\n\nThis means that $40.00 was spent on the entrees. The remaining money, which was spent on the appetizers, is the total amount spent minus the amount spent on the entrees:\n\n\\[\n50.00 - 40.00 = 10.00\n\\]\n\nSince Tim bought 2 appetizers and the total cost of the appetizers is $10.00, we can find the cost of each appetizer by dividing $10.00 by 2:\n\n\\[\n10.00 \\div 2 = 5.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the price of a single appetizer is \\(\\boxed{5.00}\\).",
