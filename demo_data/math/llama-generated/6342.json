Since Jake wants to make $20 per hour working for the neighbors, we can calculate his desired total earnings for the entire job by adding the time spent on both tasks and then multiplying by his hourly rate.\n\nThe total time spent on the job is the sum of the time spent mowing the lawn and the time spent planting the flowers:\n\\[1 \\text{ hour} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 3 \\text{ hours}\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the desired total earnings by multiplying the total time by Jake's hourly rate:\n\\[3 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$20/\\text{hour} = \\$60\\]\n\nSince we know that Jake earns $15 for mowing the lawn, we can find out how much he should charge for planting the flowers by subtracting the amount he earns from mowing the lawn from the desired total earnings:\n\\[\\$60 - \\$15 = \\$45\\]\n\nTherefore, Jake should charge \\(\\boxed{45}\\) dollars for planting the flowers.",
