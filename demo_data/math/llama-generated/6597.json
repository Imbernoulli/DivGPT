Two dozen years is equivalent to \\( 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\) years. Therefore, we are interested in Mel's age when Katherine is 24 years old.\n\nSince Mel is three years younger than Katherine, we can calculate Mel's age at that time by subtracting 3 from Katherine's age:\n\\[\nM = 24 - 3\n\\]\n\\[\nM = 21\n\\]\n\nThus, when Katherine is two dozen years old, Mel will be \\(\\boxed{21}\\) years old.",
