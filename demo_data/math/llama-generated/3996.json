Multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks to find the total number of pages taken over 6 weeks.\n3. Determine how many packs of notebook paper are needed based on the total number of pages.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pages Chip takes on notes each week. Chip takes 2 pages of notes per day, 5 days a week, for each of his 5 classes.
