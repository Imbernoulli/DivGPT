        "To determine how many more books Peter has read than his brother, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of books Peter has read.\n2. Calculate the number of books his brother has read.\n3. Find the difference between the number of books Peter has read and the number of books his brother has read.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of books Peter has read. Peter has read 40% of his 20 books. We can find this by multiplying 20 by 40% (or 0.40):\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 0.40 = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, Peter has read 8 books.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of books his brother has read. His brother has read 10% of the 20 books. We can find this by multiplying 20 by 10% (or 0.10):\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 0.10 = 2\n\\]\n\nSo, his brother has read 2 books.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of books Peter has read and the number of books his brother has read:\n\n\\[\n8 - 2 = 6\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Peter has read 6 more books than his brother. The final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",

We can find this by multiplying 20 by 40% (which is the same as multiplying by 0.40):\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 0.40 = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, Peter has read 8 books.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of books Peter's brother has read. Peter's brother has read 10% of the 20 books. We can find this by multiplying 20 by 10% (which is the same as multiplying by 0.10):\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 0.10 = 2\n\\]\n\nSo, Peter's brother has read 2 books.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of books Peter has read and the number of books his brother has read:\n\n\\[\n8 - 2 = 6\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Peter has read \\(\\boxed{6}\\) more books than his brother.",
        "To determine how many more books Peter has read than his brother, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of books Peter has read.\n2.

Find the difference between the number of books Peter has read and the number of books his brother has read.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of books Peter has read. Peter has read 40% of his 20 books. So, we compute:\n\\[ 40\\% \\text{ of } 20 = \\frac{40}{100} \\times 20 = 0.4 \\times 20 = 8 \\]\nTherefore, Peter has read 8 books.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of books his brother has read. His brother has read 10% of his 20 books. So, we compute:\n\\[ 10\\% \\text{ of } 20 = \\frac{10}{100} \\times 20 = 0.1 \\times 20 = 2 \\]\nTherefore, his brother has read 2 books.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the number of books Peter has read and the number of books his brother has read:\n\\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \\]\nSo, Peter has read 6 more books than his brother.
