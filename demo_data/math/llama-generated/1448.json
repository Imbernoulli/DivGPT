        "To determine how many more toothbrushes Dr. Banks gave out in the busiest month versus the slowest month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of toothbrushes given away in January, February, and March.\n2. Subtract the total number of toothbrushes given away in January, February, and March from the initial number of toothbrushes to find out how many were given away in April and May.\n3.

Therefore, the number of toothbrushes given away in April is:\n\\[ \\frac{164}{2} = 82 \\]\nAnd the number of toothbrushes given away in May is also:\n\\[ \\frac{164}{2} = 82 \\]\n\nNow, we compare the number of toothbrushes given away in each month:\n- January: 53\n- February: 67\n- March: 46\n- April: 82\n- May: 82\n\nThe busiest month is April (and May, but we only need to consider one of them for the difference), and the slowest month is March. The difference in the number of toothbrushes given away between the busiest month and the slowest month is:\n\\[ 82 - 46 = 36 \\]\n\nThus, the number of more toothbrushes Dr. Banks gave out in the busiest month versus the slowest month is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]",
        "To determine how many more toothbrushes Dr. Banks gave out in the busiest month versus the slowest month, we need to calculate the number of toothbrushes given away each month and then find the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of toothbrushes given away in January, February, and March:\n\\[\n53 + 67 + 46 = 166\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract this total from the initial number of toothbrushes to find out how many toothbrushes were left to be given away in April and May:\n\\[\n330 - 166 = 164\n\\]\n\nSince Dr. Banks gave away the remaining toothbrushes equally in April and May, we divide the remaining number by 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{164}{2} = 82\n\\]\n\nNow, we have the number of toothbrushes given away each month:\n- January: 53\n- February: 67\n- March: 46\n- April: 82\n- May: 82\n\nThe busiest month is April (or May) with 82 toothbrushes given away, and the slowest month is March with 46 toothbrushes given away. The difference between the busiest and slowest months is:\n\\[\n82 - 46 = 36\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Dr. Banks gave out \\(\\boxed{36}\\) more toothbrushes in the busiest month versus the slowest month."
