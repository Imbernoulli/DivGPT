        "To determine the number of brass players in the marching band, we start by defining variables for the number of each type of player. Let \\( b \\) represent the number of brass players. According to the problem, there are twice as many woodwind players as there are brass players, so the number of woodwind players is \\( 2b \\). Additionally, there are 4 times as many percussion players as there are woodwind players, so the number of percussion players is \\( 4 \\times 2b = 8b \\).\n\nThe total number of players in the band is the sum of the brass, woodwind, and percussion players. This can be expressed with the equation:\n\\[ b + 2b + 8b = 110 \\]\n\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 11b = 110 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( b \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:\n\\[ b = \\frac{110}{11} = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of brass players is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
