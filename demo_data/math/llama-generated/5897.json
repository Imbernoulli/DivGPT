        "To determine how many more trees the company needs to plant, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of trees chopped down in the entire year.\n2.

The company chops down 200 trees in the first half of the year and 300 trees in the second half of the year. Therefore, the total number of trees chopped down in the entire year is:\n   \\[\n   200 + 300 = 500\n   \\]\n\n2. The company wants to plant three more trees for every tree they chop down. So, for each tree chopped down, they need to plant 3 trees.\n\n3. To find out the total number of trees to be planted, we multiply the total number of trees chopped down by 3:\n   \\[\n   500 \\times 3 = 1500\n   \\]\n\n4. Therefore, the company needs to plant \\boxed{1500} more trees.",
