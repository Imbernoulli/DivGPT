        "To determine how long it will take to fill the pool, we need to calculate the total rate at which the four hoses deliver water and then use that rate to find the time required to fill the pool.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the rate of water delivery for each type of hose:\n- Two hoses each deliver water at a rate of 2 gallons per minute.\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ hoses} \\times 2 \\text{ gallons per minute per hose} = 4 \\text{ gallons per minute}\n  \\]\n\n- Two hoses each deliver water at a rate of 3 gallons per minute.\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ hoses} \\times 3 \\text{ gallons per minute per hose} = 6 \\text{ gallons per minute}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we add the rates of all four hoses to find the total rate of water delivery:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ gallons per minute} + 6 \\text{ gallons per minute} = 10 \\text{ gallons per minute}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know the total rate of water delivery is 10 gallons per minute. The volume of the pool is 15,000 gallons. To find the time it takes to fill the pool, we divide the volume by the total rate:\n\\[\n\\frac{15,000 \\text{ gallons}}{10 \\text{ gallons per minute}} = 1,500 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert minutes to hours:\n\\[\n\\frac{1,500 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes per hour}} = 25 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take \\boxed{25} hours to fill the pool.",
