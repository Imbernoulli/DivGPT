        "To determine the total number of employees in the two buses combined, we start by calculating the number of employees in each bus individually.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of employees in the first bus. The first bus is 60% full and has a capacity of 150. Therefore, the number of employees in the first bus is:\n\\[\n0.60 \\times 150 = 90\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of employees in the second bus. The second bus is 70% full and also has a capacity of 150. Therefore, the number of employees in the second bus is:\n\\[\n0.70 \\times 150 = 105\n\\]\n\nTo find the total number of employees in both buses combined, we add the number of employees in the first bus to the number of employees in the second bus:\n\\[\n90 + 105 = 195\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of employees in the two buses combined is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{195}\n\\]",

The first bus has a capacity of 150 and is 60% full. So, we multiply the capacity by 60% (which is the same as 0.60):\n\\[\n150 \\times 0.60 = 90\n\\]\nTherefore, the first bus has 90 employees.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of employees in the second bus.

So, we multiply the capacity by 70% (which is the same as 0.70):\n\\[\n150 \\times 0.70 = 105\n\\]\nTherefore, the second bus has 105 employees.\n\nNow, we add the number of employees from both buses to get the total number of employees:\n\\[\n90 + 105 = 195\n\\]\nSo, the total number of employees in the two buses combined is \\boxed{195}.",
