They have to travel through the house of mirrors a few times before they finally get out and when they leave, they discuss how many times they've seen their own reflections. Sarah says that every time they were in the room with tall mirrors, she saw her reflection 10 times and every time they were in the room with wide mirrors, she saw her reflection 5 times. Ellie says that every time they were in the room with tall mirrors, she saw her reflection 6 times and every time they were in the room with wide mirrors she saw her reflection 3 times. They both passed through the room with tall mirrors 3 times each and they both passed through the room with wide mirrors 5 times each. In total, how many times did Sarah and Ellie see their reflections?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total number of times Sarah and Ellie saw their reflections, we need to calculate the reflections each of them saw in the rooms with tall mirrors and the rooms with wide mirrors, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of times Sarah saw her reflection:\n- Sarah saw her reflection 10 times each time she was in the room with tall mirrors. Since she passed through the room with tall mirrors 3 times, the total number of reflections she saw in the room with tall mirrors is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 3 = 30\n  \\]\n- Sarah saw her reflection 5 times each time she was in the room with wide mirrors. Since she passed through the room with wide mirrors 5 times, the total number of reflections she saw in the room with wide mirrors is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 5 = 25\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the total number of reflections Sarah saw is:\n  \\[\n  30 + 25 = 55\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of times Ellie saw her reflection:\n- Ellie saw her reflection 6 times each time she was in the room with tall mirrors. Since she passed through the room with tall mirrors 3 times, the total number of reflections she saw in the room with tall mirrors is:\n  \\[\n  6 \\times 3 = 18\n  \\]\n- Ellie saw her reflection 3 times each time she was in the room with wide mirrors. Since she passed through the room with wide mirrors 5 times, the total number of reflections she saw in the room with wide mirrors is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 5 = 15\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the total number of reflections Ellie saw is:\n  \\[\n  18 + 15 = 33\n  \\]\n\nFinally, to find the total number of reflections both Sarah and Ellie saw, we add the number of reflections Sarah saw to the number of reflections Ellie saw:\n\\[\n55 + 33 = 88\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of times Sarah and Ellie saw their reflections is \\(\\boxed{88}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of times Sarah and Ellie saw their reflections, we need to calculate the reflections each of them saw in the room with tall mirrors and the room with wide mirrors, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of reflections Sarah saw:\n- Sarah saw her reflection 10 times each time she was in the room with tall mirrors. Since she passed through the room with tall mirrors 3 times, the total number of reflections she saw in the room with tall mirrors is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 3 = 30\n  \\]\n- Sarah saw her reflection 5 times each time she was in the room with wide mirrors. Since she passed through the room with wide mirrors 5 times, the total number of reflections she saw in the room with wide mirrors is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 5 = 25\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the total number of reflections Sarah saw is:\n  \\[\n  30 + 25 = 55\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of reflections Ellie saw:\n- Ellie saw her reflection 6 times each time she was in the room with tall mirrors. Since she passed through the room with tall mirrors 3 times, the total number of reflections she saw in the room with tall mirrors is:\n  \\[\n  6 \\times 3 = 18\n  \\]\n- Ellie saw her reflection 3 times each time she was in the room with wide mirrors. Since she passed through the room with wide mirrors 5 times, the total number of reflections she saw in the room with wide mirrors is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 5 = 15\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the total number of reflections Ellie saw is:\n  \\[\n  18 + 15 = 33\n  \\]\n\nFinally, to find the total number of reflections Sarah and Ellie saw together, we add the number of reflections Sarah saw to the number of reflections Ellie saw:\n\\[\n55 + 33 = 88\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of times Sarah and Ellie saw their reflections is \\(\\boxed{88}\\).",
