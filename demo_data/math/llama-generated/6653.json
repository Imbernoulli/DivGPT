        "Let's denote the three consecutive odd integers as \\(x-2\\), \\(x\\), and \\(x+2\\). According to the problem, the sum of these three integers is -147. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\n(x-2) + x + (x+2) = -147\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nx - 2 + x + x + 2 = -147\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies further to:\n\n\\[\n3x = -147\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-147}{3} = -49\n\\]\n\nSo, the three consecutive odd integers are \\(-49-2\\), \\(-49\\), and \\(-49+2\\), which are \\(-51\\), \\(-49\\), and \\(-47\\). The largest of these three integers is \\(-47\\).\n\nTherefore, the largest number is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-47}\n\\]",
        "To find the three consecutive odd integers that sum up to -147, we can represent these integers in terms of a variable. Let the middle odd integer be \\( x \\). Then the three consecutive odd integers can be written as \\( x-2 \\), \\( x \\), and \\( x+2 \\).\n\nThe sum of these three integers is:\n\\[\n(x-2) + x + (x+2)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\\[\nx-2 + x + x+2 = 3x\n\\]\n\nWe know that the sum of these integers is -147, so we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n3x = -147\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-147}{3} = -49\n\\]\n\nThe three consecutive odd integers are \\( x-2 \\), \\( x \\), and \\( x+2 \\). Substituting \\( x = -49 \\) into these expressions, we get:\n\\[\nx-2 = -49-2 = -51\n\\]\n\\[\nx = -49\n\\]\n\\[\nx+2 = -49+2 = -47\n\\]\n\nThe largest of these three integers is \\( -47 \\).\n\nTherefore, the largest number is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-47}\n\\]"
