        "To determine the number of hats each person gets after combining and sharing them equally, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of red hats Zola has.\n2.

Since Paityn has 20 red hats, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{5} \\times 20 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Zola has 16 red hats.\n\n2. Zola has twice the number of blue hats as Paityn. Since Paityn has 24 blue hats, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 24 = 48\n   \\]\n   So, Zola has 48 blue hats.\n\n3. The total number of hats Paityn has is the sum of her red and blue hats:\n   \\[\n   20 + 24 = 44\n   \\]\n\n4.

To find out how many hats each person gets, we divide the total number of hats by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{108}{2} = 54\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hats each gets is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
