        "To determine how many necklaces Latch caught, we need to follow the information given step by step.\n\n1. First, we find out how many necklaces Rhonda caught. According to the problem, Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux. Since Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of necklaces Rhonda caught} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how many necklaces Latch caught.
