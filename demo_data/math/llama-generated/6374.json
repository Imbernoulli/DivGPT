        "To determine the amount of food remaining in the food bank, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of food donated in the second week.\n2. Find the total amount of food donated over the first two weeks.\n3. Determine the amount of food given out in the third week.\n4. Subtract the amount of food given out from the total amount donated to find the remaining food.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The amount of food donated in the second week is twice the amount donated in the first week. Since 40 pounds were donated in the first week, the amount donated in the second week is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 40 = 80 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. The total amount of food donated over the first two weeks is the sum of the donations from the first week and the second week:\n   \\[\n   40 + 80 = 120 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. In the third week, Lyanna gave out 70% of the donated food. To find out how much food was given out, we calculate 70% of 120 pounds:\n   \\[\n   0.70 \\times 120 = 84 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. The amount of food remaining in the food bank is the total amount donated minus the amount given out:\n   \\[\n   120 - 84 = 36 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of food remaining in the food bank is \\boxed{36}.",

        "To determine the amount of food remaining in the food bank, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of food donated in the first two weeks.\n2. Determine how much food was given out in the third week.\n3. Subtract the amount of food given out from the total amount donated to find the remaining food.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of food donated in the first two weeks. In the first week, 40 pounds of food were donated. In the second week, the donations were twice as high as the first week, so:\n\\[ 2 \\times 40 = 80 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nAdding the donations from the first and second weeks gives:\n\\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much food was given out in the third week. Lyanna gave out 70% of the donated food. Therefore, we calculate 70% of 120 pounds:\n\\[ 0.70 \\times 120 = 84 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the amount of food given out from the total amount donated to find the remaining food:\n\\[ 120 - 84 = 36 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThus, the amount of food remaining in the food bank is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
