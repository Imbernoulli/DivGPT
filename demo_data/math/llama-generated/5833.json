        "To determine how much Emily's salary would be after she takes part of her salary to ensure all of her employees make $35,000 per year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total current salary of all employees.\n2. Calculate the total desired salary of all employees.\n3. Determine the difference between the desired total salary and the current total salary.\n4. Subtract this difference from Emily's current salary to find her new salary.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total current salary of all employees:**\n   Each employee currently makes $20,000 per year, and there are 10 employees.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total current salary} = 10 \\times 20,000 = 200,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total desired salary of all employees:**\n   Each employee desired salary is $35,000 per year, and there are 10 employees.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total desired salary} = 10 \\times 35,000 = 350,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the difference between the desired total salary and the current total salary:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 350,000 - 200,000 = 150,000\n   \\]\n   This difference is the amount Emily needs to give to her employees to increase their salaries to $35,000 each.\n\n4. **Subtract this difference from Emily's current salary to find her new salary:**\n   Emily's current salary is $1,000,000.\n   \\[\n   \\text{New salary} = 1,000,000 - 150,000 = 850,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Emily's new salary would be \\(\\boxed{850000}\\).",
