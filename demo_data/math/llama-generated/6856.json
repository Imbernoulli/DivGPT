        "To determine the daily average rain total for the week, we need to calculate the total rainfall for each day and then sum these amounts. Finally, we will divide the total rainfall by the number of days in the week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the rainfall for each day:\n\n- **Monday**: Emily sees that it rained 2 inches in the morning and 1 inch later in the day. So, the total rainfall on Monday is:\n  \\[\n  2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ inches}\n  \\]\n\n- **Tuesday**: It rained twice as much as it did on Monday. Since it rained 3 inches on Monday, the total rainfall on Tuesday is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n  \\]\n\n- **Wednesday**: It did not rain at all. So, the total rainfall on Wednesday is:\n  \\[\n  0 \\text{ inches}\n  \\]\n\n- **Thursday**: It rained 1 inch. So, the total rainfall on Thursday is:\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ inch}\n  \\]\n\n- **Friday**: The total rainfall on Friday was equal to the combined total for Monday through Thursday. First, we sum the rainfall from Monday through Thursday:\n  \\[\n  3 + 6 + 0 + 1 = 10 \\text{ inches}\n  \\]\n  Therefore, the total rainfall on Friday is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ inches}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we sum the total rainfall for the entire week:\n\\[\n3 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 10 = 20 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the daily average rain total by dividing the total rainfall by the number of days in the week (which is 5):\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{5} = 4 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThus, the daily average rain total for the week is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
