        "To determine the number of Kia vehicles on the lot, we start by defining the number of each type of vehicle in terms of the total number of vehicles. Let's denote the total number of vehicles by \\( T \\), the number of Dodge vehicles by \\( D \\), the number of Hyundai vehicles by \\( H \\), and the number of Kia vehicles by \\( K \\). According to the problem, the total number of vehicles is 400, so we have:\n\n\\[ T = D + H + K = 400 \\]\n\nWe are given that half of the vehicles on the lot are Dodge. Therefore, the number of Dodge vehicles is:\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{T}{2} = \\frac{400}{2} = 200 \\]\n\nWe are also given that there are half as many Hyundai vehicles as there are Dodge vehicles. Therefore, the number of Hyundai vehicles is:\n\n\\[ H = \\frac{D}{2} = \\frac{200}{2} = 100 \\]\n\nNow, we substitute the values of \\( D \\) and \\( H \\) into the equation for the total number of vehicles:\n\n\\[ 200 + 100 + K = 400 \\]\n\nTo find the number of Kia vehicles, we solve for \\( K \\):\n\n\\[ K = 400 - 200 - 100 = 100 \\]\n\nThus, the number of Kia vehicles on the lot is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]",
