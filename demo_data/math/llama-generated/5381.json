        "First, we determine how many pencils Jeff donated. Jeff initially had 300 pencils and donated 30% of them. The number of pencils Jeff donated is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ 300 \\times 0.30 = 90 \\]\n\nAfter donating 90 pencils, the number of pencils Jeff has left is:\n\n\\[ 300 - 90 = 210 \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many pencils Vicki donated. Vicki had twice as many pencils as Jeff, so she initially had:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 300 = 600 \\]\n\nVicki donated \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of her pencils. The number of pencils Vicki donated is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ 600 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 450 \\]\n\nAfter donating 450 pencils, the number of pencils Vicki has left is:\n\n\\[ 600 - 450 = 150 \\]\n\nTo find the total number of pencils remaining altogether, we add the number of pencils Jeff has left to the number of pencils Vicki has left:\n\n\\[ 210 + 150 = 360 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pencils remaining altogether is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]",
