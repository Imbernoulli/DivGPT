        "To determine the price of the coffee table, we need to start by calculating the total cost of the other items in the living room set. The items include a sofa, two armchairs, and the coffee table.\n\n1. The cost of the sofa is $1,250.\n2. The cost of each armchair is $425, and there are two armchairs. Therefore, the total cost of the armchairs is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 425 = 850\n   \\]\n\n3. Let the price of the coffee table be denoted as \\( x \\).\n\nThe total cost of the living room set is the sum of the cost of the sofa, the cost of the armchairs, and the cost of the coffee table. According to the problem, the total invoice amount is $2,430. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n1250 + 850 + x = 2430\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine the known costs:\n\\[\n2100 + x = 2430\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we subtract 2100 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nx = 2430 - 2100\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 330\n\\]\n\nThus, the price of the coffee table is \\(\\boxed{330}\\).",

Subtract the total cost of the sofa and the two armchairs from the invoice amount to find the price of the coffee table:\n   \\[\n   2430 - 2100 = 330\n   \\]\n   So, the price of the coffee table is \\(\\boxed{330}\\).",
