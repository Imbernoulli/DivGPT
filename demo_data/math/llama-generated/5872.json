        "To determine how many cupcakes Carl must sell per day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cupcakes Carl needs to sell after accounting for the cupcakes he has to give to Bonnie.\n2. Divide the remaining number of cupcakes by the number of days Carl has to sell them.\n\nFirst, we know Carl's goal is to sell 96 cupcakes in 2 days, but he needs to give 24 cupcakes to Bonnie.

Therefore, the total number of cupcakes Carl needs to sell is:\n\n\\[ 96 + 24 = 120 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cupcakes Carl needs to sell per day. Since he has 2 days to sell these cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by 2:\n\n\\[ 120 \\div 2 = 60 \\]\n\nThus, Carl must sell \\(\\boxed{60}\\) cupcakes per day to reach his goal.",
