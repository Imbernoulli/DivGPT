Since she has 2 potatoes, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of carrots} = 6 \\times 2 = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of onions:**\n   Maria wants to cut up twice as many onions as carrots. Since she has 12 carrots, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of onions} = 2 \\times 12 = 24\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of green beans:**\n   Maria wants to cut up \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) as many green beans as onions. Since she has 24 onions, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of green beans} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 24 = 8\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Maria needs to cut \\(\\boxed{8}\\) green beans."
