        "To determine how much Simon must spend to make 40 kabob sticks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of beef cubes needed for 40 kabob sticks.\n2.

Calculate the total cost of the slabs of beef.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of beef cubes needed for 40 kabob sticks.**\n\nEach kabob stick has 4 cubes of beef. Therefore, for 40 kabob sticks, the total number of beef cubes needed is:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ kabob sticks} \\times 4 \\text{ cubes per kabob stick} = 160 \\text{ cubes} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many slabs of beef are required to get the total number of beef cubes.**\n\nEach slab of beef can be cut into 80 cubes. Therefore, to find out how many slabs are needed for 160 cubes, we divide the total number of cubes by the number of cubes per slab:\n\\[ 160 \\text{ cubes} \\div 80 \\text{ cubes per slab} = 2 \\text{ slabs} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the slabs of beef.**\n\nEach slab of beef costs $25.
