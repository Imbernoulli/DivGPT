        "To determine how long Fiona was cleaning, we start by noting that the total time spent cleaning the room is 8 hours. According to the problem, a quarter of the time was spent by Lilly, and Fiona was responsible for the rest of the cleaning.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time Lilly spent cleaning:\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent by Lilly} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 8 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find out how much time Fiona spent cleaning by subtracting the time spent by Lilly from the total time:\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent by Fiona} = 8 \\text{ hours} - 2 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we convert the time spent by Fiona from hours to minutes.
