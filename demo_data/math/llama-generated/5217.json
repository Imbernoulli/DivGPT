        "To determine how many pairs of jeans both of Noah's closets can fit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the capacity of one of Noah's closets:**\n   - Ali's closet can fit 200 pairs of jeans.\n   - Each of Noah's closets can fit \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) as much as Ali's closet.\n   - Therefore, the capacity of one of Noah's closets is:\n     \\[\n     200 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 50 \\text{ pairs of jeans}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total capacity of both Noah's closets:**\n   - Noah has two closets.\n   - Each closet can fit 50 pairs of jeans.\n   - Therefore, the total capacity of both closets is:\n     \\[\n     50 \\times 2 = 100 \\text{ pairs of jeans}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pairs of jeans that both of Noah's closets can fit is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
