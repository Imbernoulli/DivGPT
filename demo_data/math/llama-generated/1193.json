        "To determine how much the restaurant charged for gratuities, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the subtotal of the items ordered.\n2. Add the sales tax to the subtotal to get the total after tax.\n3. Subtract the total after tax from the total bill to find the gratuities.\n\nLet's start with the subtotal:\nThe NY Striploin cost $80 and the glass of wine cost $10, so the subtotal is:\n\\[ 80 + 10 = 90 \\]\n\nNext, we add the sales tax to the subtotal. The sales tax rate is 10%, so we calculate 10% of $90:\n\\[ 0.10 \\times 90 = 9 \\]\nAdding this to the subtotal gives us the total after tax:\n\\[ 90 + 9 = 99 \\]\n\nThe total bill given was $140. To find the gratuities, we subtract the total after tax from the total bill:\n\\[ 140 - 99 = 41 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount charged for gratuities is:\n\\[ \\boxed{41} \\]",

The sales tax rate is 10%, so the sales tax amount is:\n\\[ 90 \\times 0.10 = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we determine the total cost after adding the sales tax:\n\\[ 90 + 9 = 99 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total cost after tax from the total bill to find the gratuities charged:\n\\[ 140 - 99 = 41 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the restaurant charged \\(\\boxed{41}\\) dollars for gratuities.",
        "First, let's determine the total cost of the items before tax.
