        "First, we need to determine the initial number of marbles of each color. Since Beth has 72 marbles and each color has the same amount, we divide 72 by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{72}{3} = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, Beth initially has 24 red, 24 blue, and 24 yellow marbles.\n\nNext, we calculate how many marbles Beth loses for each color:\n- Beth loses 5 red marbles.\n- Beth loses twice as many blue marbles as red marbles. Since she loses 5 red marbles, she loses \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) blue marbles.\n- Beth loses three times as many yellow marbles as red marbles. Since she loses 5 red marbles, she loses \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) yellow marbles.\n\nNow, we subtract the number of marbles lost from the initial number of marbles for each color:\n- Red marbles left: \\(24 - 5 = 19\\)\n- Blue marbles left: \\(24 - 10 = 14\\)\n- Yellow marbles left: \\(24 - 15 = 9\\)\n\nFinally, we add the remaining marbles of all three colors to find the total number of marbles Beth has left:\n\n\\[\n19 + 14 + 9 = 42\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of marbles Beth has left is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",
        "To determine how many marbles Beth has left after losing some, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of marbles of each color:**\n   Beth has 72 marbles in total, and each color has the same amount.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of marbles per color} = \\frac{72}{3} = 24\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of marbles lost for each color:**\n   - Beth loses 5 red marbles.\n   - She loses twice as many blue marbles as red marbles:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Blue marbles lost} = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n     \\]\n   - She loses three times as many yellow marbles as red marbles:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Yellow marbles lost} = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of marbles lost:**\n   Add the marbles lost for all three colors:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total marbles lost} = 5 \\text{ (red)} + 10 \\text{ (blue)} + 15 \\text{ (yellow)} = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of marbles remaining:**\n   Subtract the total number of marbles lost from the initial total:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Marbles remaining} = 72 - 30 = 42\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of marbles Beth has left is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",

Since she loses 5 red marbles, she loses:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 5 = 10\n     \\]\n     blue marbles.\n   - Beth loses three times as many yellow marbles as red marbles.

Therefore, the number of marbles left is:\n   \\[\n   72 - 30 = 42\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of marbles Beth has left is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",
