Use the number of water balloons Randy has to find out how many water balloons Cynthia has.\n\nFirst, we know that Janice has 6 water balloons and Randy has half as many water balloons as Janice. Therefore, we calculate the number of water balloons Randy has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of water balloons Randy has} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Cynthia has four times as many water balloons as Randy. Therefore, we calculate the number of water balloons Cynthia has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of water balloons Cynthia has} = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n\\]\n\nThe number of water balloons Cynthia has is not affected by Janice throwing her water balloons at Randy.
