        "To determine how many more dollars per month the shoe company needs to make to achieve their annual goal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money the company currently makes in a year.\n2. Determine the difference between the current annual revenue and the desired annual revenue.\n3. Find out how many more dollars per month are needed to make up for the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money the company currently makes in a year. Since they sell $4000 worth of shoes every month, we multiply this monthly amount by 12 (the number of months in a year):\n\n\\[\n4000 \\times 12 = 48000\n\\]\n\nThe company currently makes $48000 in a year. Their goal is to make $60000 in a year. To find out how many more dollars per month they need to make, we first determine the difference between the desired annual revenue and the current annual revenue:\n\n\\[\n60000 - 48000 = 12000\n\\]\n\nThis means the company needs to make an additional $12000 in a year. To find out how many more dollars per month this corresponds to, we divide the annual difference by 12:\n\n\\[\n12000 \\div 12 = 1000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the company needs to make an additional $1000 per month to achieve their annual goal. The answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1000}\n\\]",

There are 12 months in a year, so the current annual revenue is:\n\\[ 4000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months} = 48000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the difference between the company's current annual revenue and their target annual revenue.**\n\nThe target annual revenue is $60000. The difference between the target and the current revenue is:\n\\[ 60000 \\text{ dollars} - 48000 \\text{ dollars} = 12000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many more dollars per month the company needs to make to cover the difference.**\n\nTo find out how many more dollars per month the company needs to make, we divide the difference by the number of months in a year:\n\\[ 12000 \\text{ dollars} \\div 12 \\text{ months} = 1000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\nTherefore, the company needs to make \\(\\boxed{1000}\\) more dollars per month to reach their annual goal of $60000.",
        "To determine how many more dollars per month the shoe company should make to reach their annual goal of $60000, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the current annual revenue:**\n   The company currently sells $4000 worth of shoes each month. Therefore, the annual revenue is:\n   \\[\n   4000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 48000 \\text{ dollars/year}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the target annual revenue:**\n   The company wants to make $60000 in an entire year.\n\n3. **Calculate the additional annual revenue needed:**\n   The additional revenue needed is the difference between the target annual revenue and the current annual revenue:\n   \\[\n   60000 \\text{ dollars/year} - 48000 \\text{ dollars/year} = 12000 \\text{ dollars/year}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert the additional annual revenue to monthly revenue:**\n   To find out how many more dollars per month are needed, we divide the additional annual revenue by the number of months in a year:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12000 \\text{ dollars/year}}{12 \\text{ months/year}} = 1000 \\text{ dollars/month}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the company should make \\(\\boxed{1000}\\) more dollars per month to meet their annual goal of $60000.",
