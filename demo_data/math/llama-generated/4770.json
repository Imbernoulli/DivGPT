        "To determine how many slices of bread Kiki's guests ate, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches consumed and then determine how many slices of bread those sandwiches account for.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of triangles from the cucumber sandwiches:\n- Each cucumber sandwich is cut into 4 triangles.\n- Kiki made 10 cucumber sandwiches.\n\\[\n4 \\text{ triangles/sandwich} \\times 10 \\text{ sandwiches} = 40 \\text{ triangles}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of rectangles from the egg sandwiches:\n- Each egg sandwich is cut into 2 rectangles.\n- Kiki made 8 egg sandwiches.\n\\[\n2 \\text{ rectangles/sandwich} \\times 8 \\text{ sandwiches} = 16 \\text{ rectangles}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that the guests ate 28 triangles and 12 rectangles.
