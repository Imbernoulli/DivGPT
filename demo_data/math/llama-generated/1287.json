After 1 hour, the total number of snowflakes is the initial number plus the number of snowflakes that fell. According to the problem, this total is 58. So, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   x + 48 = 58\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   To find \\( x \\), subtract 48 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   x = 58 - 48 = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the initial number of snowflakes was \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
