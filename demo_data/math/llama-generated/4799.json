        "To determine how many minutes the second runner can remain stopped before the first runner catches up, we need to calculate the distances each runner has covered after 56 minutes and then find the time it takes for the first runner to cover the remaining distance to catch up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance each runner has covered after 56 minutes.\n\n**Second Runner:**\n- The second runner's pace is 7 minutes per mile.\n- In 56 minutes, the distance covered by the second runner is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance}_{\\text{second}} = \\frac{56 \\text{ minutes}}{7 \\text{ minutes per mile}} = 8 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n\n**First Runner:**\n- The first runner's pace is 8 minutes per mile.\n- In 56 minutes, the distance covered by the first runner is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance}_{\\text{first}} = \\frac{56 \\text{ minutes}}{8 \\text{ minutes per mile}} = 7 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n\nAfter 56 minutes, the second runner has covered 8 miles, and the first runner has covered 7 miles. The second runner is 1 mile ahead of the first runner.\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes for the first runner to cover this 1-mile gap. The first runner's pace is 8 minutes per mile, so the time it takes for the first runner to cover 1 mile is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time to cover 1 mile} = 8 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the second runner can remain stopped for 8 minutes before the first runner catches up.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",

Let \\( t \\) be the time in minutes that the second runner remains stopped.\n\nDuring this time, the first runner continues to run. The additional distance the first runner covers in \\( t \\) minutes is:\n\\[\n\\text{Additional Distance}_{\\text{first}} = \\frac{t \\text{ minutes}}{8 \\text{ minutes per mile}} = \\frac{t}{8} \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nWhen the second runner stops, he is 1 mile ahead of the first runner (since he has covered 8 miles and the first runner has covered 7 miles). For the first runner to catch up, he needs to cover this 1-mile gap. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{8} = 1\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( t \\):\n\\[\nt = 1 \\times 8 = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the second runner can remain stopped for \\(\\boxed{8}\\) minutes before the first runner catches up with him.",

Since the first runner runs at an average pace of 8 minutes per mile, we can find the distance by dividing the total time by the pace:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance covered by the first runner} = \\frac{56 \\text{ minutes}}{8 \\text{ minutes per mile}} = 7 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nWhen the second runner stops, he is 8 miles from the start and the first runner is 7 miles from the start.

Therefore, the second runner is 1 mile ahead of the first runner.\n\nNext, we need to determine how long it will take the first runner to cover this 1-mile gap. The first runner runs at a pace of 8 minutes per mile, so it will take him:\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{8 \\text{ minutes per mile}} = 8 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the second runner can remain stopped for \\(\\boxed{8}\\) minutes before the first runner catches up with him.",

This distance is:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ miles} - 7 \\text{ miles} = 1 \\text{ mile}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it takes the first runner to cover this 1-mile distance. Since the first runner runs at an average pace of 8 minutes per mile, the time it takes for the first runner to cover 1 mile is:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ mile} \\times 8 \\text{ minutes per mile} = 8 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the second runner can remain stopped for \\(\\boxed{8}\\) minutes before the first runner catches up with him.",

Since the second runner runs at an average pace of 7 minutes per mile, we can find the distance by dividing the total time by the pace:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance covered by the second runner} = \\frac{56 \\text{ minutes}}{7 \\text{ minutes per mile}} = 8 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance the first runner covers in 56 minutes.
