        "To determine how many meals Angela delivers, we start by defining variables for the unknowns. Let \\( m \\) represent the number of meals Angela delivers. According to the problem, Angela delivers 8 times as many packages as meals, so the number of packages she delivers can be expressed as \\( 8m \\).\n\nThe total number of meals and packages combined is given as 27. Therefore, we can write the following equation to represent this relationship:\n\\[\nm + 8m = 27\n\\]\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\n9m = 27\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( m \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 9:\n\\[\nm = \\frac{27}{9} = 3\n\\]\nSo, Angela delivers \\(\\boxed{3}\\) meals.",
