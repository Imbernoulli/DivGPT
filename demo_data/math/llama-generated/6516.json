        "To determine the total number of marbles in the jar, let's denote the total number of marbles by \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem:\n- Half of the marbles are blue, so the number of blue marbles is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\).\n- A quarter of the marbles are red, so the number of red marbles is \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\).\n- There are 27 green marbles.\n- There are 14 yellow marbles.\n\nThe sum of all the marbles is equal to the total number of marbles \\( x \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{4} + 27 + 14 = x\n\\]\n\nFirst, we combine the fractions on the left side. To do this, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 2 and 4 is 4. So, we rewrite \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) as \\( \\frac{2x}{4} \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{2x}{4} + \\frac{x}{4} + 27 + 14 = x\n\\]\n\nNow, combine the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{3x}{4} + 41 = x\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting \\( \\frac{3x}{4} \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n41 = x - \\frac{3x}{4}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we need to combine the \\( x \\) terms on the right side. Again, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1 and 4 is 4. So, we rewrite \\( x \\) as \\( \\frac{4x}{4} \\):\n\\[\n41 = \\frac{4x}{4} - \\frac{3x}{4}\n\\]\n\nNow, combine the fractions:\n\\[\n41 = \\frac{x}{4}\n\\]\n\nFinally, solve for \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[\nx = 41 \\times 4\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 164\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of marbles in the jar is \\(\\boxed{164}\\).",
