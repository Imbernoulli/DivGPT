        "To determine Harry's age, we need to find the ages of Bea, Job, Figaro, and then Harry step by step.\n\n1. **Determine Bea's age:**\n   Kiarra is twice as old as Bea. Since Kiarra is 30 years old, we can write:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Kiarra's age} = 2 \\times \\text{Bea's age} \\implies 30 = 2 \\times \\text{Bea's age} \\implies \\text{Bea's age} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Job's age:**\n   Job is 3 times older than Bea. Since Bea is 15 years old, we can write:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Job's age} = 3 \\times \\text{Bea's age} \\implies \\text{Job's age} = 3 \\times 15 = 45\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Figaro's age:**\n   Figaro is 7 years older than Job. Since Job is 45 years old, we can write:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Figaro's age} = \\text{Job's age} + 7 \\implies \\text{Figaro's age} = 45 + 7 = 52\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine Harry's age:**\n   Harry is half as old as Figaro. Since Figaro is 52 years old, we can write:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Harry's age} = \\frac{\\text{Figaro's age}}{2} \\implies \\text{Harry's age} = \\frac{52}{2} = 26\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Harry is \\(\\boxed{26}\\) years old.",
