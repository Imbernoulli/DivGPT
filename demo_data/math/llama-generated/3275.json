        "To determine the population of Lake Bright, we start by defining the populations of the three towns. Let's denote the population of Toadon as \\( T \\), the population of Gordonia as \\( G \\), and the population of Lake Bright as \\( L \\).\n\nWe know the total population of the three towns is 80,000 people:\n\\[ T + G + L = 80,000. \\]\n\nWe are given that Gordonia has \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) times the total population in the three cities. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ G = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 80,000 = 40,000. \\]\n\nNext, we know that the population of Toadon is 60 percent of Gordonia's population. So, we can write:\n\\[ T = 0.60 \\times G = 0.60 \\times 40,000 = 24,000. \\]\n\nNow that we have the populations of Toadon and Gordonia, we can substitute these values into the total population equation to find the population of Lake Bright:\n\\[ T + G + L = 80,000, \\]\n\\[ 24,000 + 40,000 + L = 80,000, \\]\n\\[ 64,000 + L = 80,000, \\]\n\\[ L = 80,000 - 64,000, \\]\n\\[ L = 16,000. \\]\n\nThus, the population of Lake Bright is \\(\\boxed{16000}\\).",
