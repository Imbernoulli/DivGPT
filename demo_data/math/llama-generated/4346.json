        "To determine the number of kittens at the animal shelter, we start by defining the relationship between the number of kittens and the number of puppies. According to the problem, there are 14 more kittens than two times the number of puppies. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of kittens} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of puppies} + 14 \\]\n\nWe know from the problem that the number of puppies is 32. So, we substitute 32 for the number of puppies in the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of kittens} = 2 \\times 32 + 14 \\]\n\nNext, we perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 32 = 64 \\]\n\nThen, we add 14 to the result of the multiplication:\n\n\\[ 64 + 14 = 78 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of kittens at the shelter is \\(\\boxed{78}\\).",
