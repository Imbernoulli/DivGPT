Calculate the new daily cost of the coffees after the price increase and reduction in the number of coffees.\n4. Find the difference between the original daily cost and the new daily cost to determine the savings.\n\nLet's start with the original daily cost:\nJohn used to buy 4 coffees a day, each costing $2.\nSo, the original daily cost is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ coffees/day} \\times \\$2/\\text{coffee} = \\$8/\\text{day} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the new price of each coffee after a 50% increase:\nThe original price is $2, so a 50% increase is:\n\\[ \\$2 \\times 0.50 = \\$1 \\]\nTherefore, the new price of each coffee is:\n\\[ \\$2 + \\$1 = \\$3 \\]\n\nJohn now drinks half the number of coffees he used to drink. Since he used to drink 4 coffees a day, he now drinks:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\text{ coffees/day} \\]\nSo, the new daily cost is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ coffees/day} \\times \\$3/\\text{coffee} = \\$6/\\text{day} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the savings by subtracting the new daily cost from the original daily cost:\n\\[ \\$8/\\text{day} - \\$6/\\text{day} = \\$2/\\text{day} \\]\n\nThus, John saves \\(\\boxed{2}\\) dollars per day compared to what he used to spend.",
