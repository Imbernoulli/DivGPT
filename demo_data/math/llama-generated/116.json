To find out how many minutes it takes him to type 2000 words, we divide the total number of words by his typing speed:\n\\[ 2000 \\text{ words} \\div 50 \\text{ words per minute} = 40 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 40 minutes into hours:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water Stan needs to drink.**\n\nStan drinks 15 ounces of water for each hour he types. Since he types for \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of an hour, we multiply the number of hours by the amount of water he drinks per hour:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ hours} \\times 15 \\text{ ounces per hour} = 10 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water Stan needs to drink while writing his paper is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",
        "To determine how much water Stan needs to drink while writing his paper, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of words in the paper:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total words} = \\text{Number of pages} \\times \\text{Words per page}\n   \\]\n   Given that Stan needs to write a 5-page paper and each page contains 400 words:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total words} = 5 \\times 400 = 2000 \\text{ words}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total time Stan spends typing:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent typing} = \\frac{\\text{Total words}}{\\text{Words per minute}}\n   \\]\n   Stan types at a rate of 50 words per minute:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent typing} = \\frac{2000}{50} = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the time spent typing into hours:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent typing in hours} = \\frac{\\text{Time spent typing in minutes}}{60}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent typing in hours} = \\frac{40}{60} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount of water Stan needs to drink:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Water needed} = \\text{Time spent typing in hours} \\times \\text{Water per hour}\n   \\]\n   Stan needs to drink 15 ounces of water per hour:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Water needed} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 15 = 10 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water Stan needs to drink while writing his paper is \\boxed{10} ounces.",
