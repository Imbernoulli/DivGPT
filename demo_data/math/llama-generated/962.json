Determine the predicted population after five years based on the given percentage increase.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the current population of Mojave.**\n\nThe population of Mojave a decade ago was 4000. The town's population has increased three times since then. Therefore, the current population is:\n\\[ 4000 \\times 3 = 12000 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the predicted population after five years.**\n\nThe population analysis firm predicts that the population will increase by 40% after five years. To find the increase in population, we calculate 40% of the current population:\n\\[ 12000 \\times 0.40 = 4800 \\]\n\nAdding this increase to the current population gives us the predicted population after five years:\n\\[ 12000 + 4800 = 16800 \\]\n\nThus, the number of people in Mojave in five years will be \\(\\boxed{16800}\\).",
        "To determine the population of Mojave in five years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the current population:**\n   - The population of Mojave a decade ago was 4000.\n   - The population has increased three times since then.\n   - Therefore, the current population is:\n     \\[\n     4000 \\times 3 = 12000\n     \\]\n\n2. **Predict the population increase over the next five years:**\n   - The population analysis firm predicts a 40% increase in the next five years.\n   - To find 40% of the current population:\n     \\[\n     12000 \\times 0.40 = 4800\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the future population:**\n   - Add the predicted increase to the current population:\n     \\[\n     12000 + 4800 = 16800\n     \\]\n\nThus, the population of Mojave in five years will be \\(\\boxed{16800}\\).",
