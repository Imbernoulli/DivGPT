They split their show into talking segments, ad breaks and songs. Talking segments last 10 minutes each, ad breaks last 5 minutes each and songs are played throughout the rest of the show. If the radio show includes 3 talking segments and 5 ad breaks in today’s show, how long, in minutes, does the show play songs?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Each ad break lasts 5 minutes, and there are 5 ad breaks:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ ad breaks} \\times 5 \\text{ minutes per break} = 25 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the total time spent on talking segments and ad breaks:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ minutes} + 25 \\text{ minutes} = 55 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThe total duration of the radio show is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 3 hours to minutes:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 180 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total time spent on talking segments and ad breaks from the total duration of the show to find the time spent playing songs:\n\\[\n180 \\text{ minutes} - 55 \\text{ minutes} = 125 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the show plays songs for \\boxed{125} minutes.",
