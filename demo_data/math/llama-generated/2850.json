        "To determine the total number of gumballs Hector purchased, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of gumballs given away to each person. Let's denote the initial number of gumballs Hector purchased as \\( x \\).\n\n1. Hector gave 4 gumballs to Todd.\n2. Hector gave twice as many gumballs to Alisha as he gave to Todd. Therefore, he gave \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) gumballs to Alisha.\n3. Hector gave 5 less than four times as many gumballs to Bobby as he gave to Alisha. Therefore, he gave \\( 4 \\times 8 - 5 = 32 - 5 = 27 \\) gumballs to Bobby.\n\nAfter giving gumballs to Todd, Alisha, and Bobby, Hector had 6 gumballs remaining. So, the total number of gumballs given away is:\n\\[ 4 + 8 + 27 = 39 \\]\n\nSince Hector had 6 gumballs left, the initial number of gumballs \\( x \\) is:\n\\[ x = 39 + 6 = 45 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of gumballs Hector purchased, we need to follow the sequence of gumballs he gave away and then add the remaining gumballs.\n\n1. **Gumballs given to Todd:**\n   Hector gave Todd 4 gumballs.\n\n2. **Gumballs given to Alisha:**\n   Hector gave Alisha twice as many gumballs as he gave to Todd.
