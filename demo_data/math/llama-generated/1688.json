        "Let's start with the initial number of cows the man had, which is 39. Last year, 25 cows died and 6 cows were sold. So, we need to subtract these numbers from the initial count:\n\n\\[ 39 - 25 - 6 = 8 \\]\n\nThis means that at the end of last year, the man had 8 cows. This year, the number of cows increased by 24, and the man bought 43 more. So, we need to add these numbers to the count of cows he had at the end of last year:\n\n\\[ 8 + 24 + 43 = 75 \\]\n\nAdditionally, his friend gave him 8 cows as a gift. So, we need to add these 8 cows to the current count:\n\n\\[ 75 + 8 = 83 \\]\n\nTherefore, the man now has \\(\\boxed{83}\\) cows.",
