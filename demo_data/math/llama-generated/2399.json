        "To determine how many minutes longer it would take Derek to walk 20 miles if he had to take his brother, we need to calculate the time it takes for each scenario and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes Derek to walk 20 miles without his brother. Since it takes him 9 minutes to walk a mile, we can multiply the time per mile by the total number of miles:\n\\[\n9 \\text{ minutes/mile} \\times 20 \\text{ miles} = 180 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes Derek to walk 20 miles with his brother. Since it takes him 12 minutes to walk a mile, we can multiply the time per mile by the total number of miles:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ minutes/mile} \\times 20 \\text{ miles} = 240 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in time between walking with his brother and walking without his brother:\n\\[\n240 \\text{ minutes} - 180 \\text{ minutes} = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it would take Derek \\boxed{60} minutes longer to walk 20 miles if he had to take his brother.",
