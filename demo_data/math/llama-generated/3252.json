        "To determine the total cost of lunch for Adam, Rick, and Jose, we start by identifying the cost of each person's lunch based on the given information.\n\n1. We know that Jose's lunch costs $45.\n2. Rick's lunch costs the same as Jose's lunch, so Rick's lunch also costs $45.\n3. Adam spends two-thirds as much money on lunch as Rick. Therefore, we calculate Adam's lunch cost as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Adam's lunch cost} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\text{Rick's lunch cost} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 45 = 30\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the costs of lunch for all three friends:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Adam's lunch cost} + \\text{Rick's lunch cost} + \\text{Jose's lunch cost} = 30 + 45 + 45 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost of lunch for all three friends is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
