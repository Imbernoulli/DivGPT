The spaceship travels at a consistent speed its entire journey unless it is stopped for the crew’s break. After launch, the spaceship traveled for 10 hours then stopped for 3 hours. It then traveled for another 10 hours then stopped for 1 hour. After this, the spaceship would take an hour’s break after every 11 hours of traveling and maintained this routine until the end of its journey. If the entire journey took 3 days then how long, in hours, was the spaceship not moving?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how long the spaceship was not moving during its journey, we need to break down the journey into segments and calculate the total time spent on breaks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time spent on breaks for the initial part of the journey:\n- The spaceship traveled for 10 hours, stopped for 3 hours.\n- Then it traveled for another 10 hours, stopped for 1 hour.\n\nSo, the total time spent on breaks for the first two segments is:\n\\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the time spent on breaks for the remaining part of the journey. The entire journey took 3 days, which is equivalent to:\n\\[ 3 \\times 24 = 72 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nAfter the first 20 hours (10 + 10), there are:\n\\[ 72 - 20 = 52 \\text{ hours} \\]\nleft in the journey.\n\nAccording to the problem, after the first 20 hours, the spaceship takes an hour's break after every 11 hours of traveling. To find out how many such breaks occur in the remaining 52 hours, we divide 52 by 11:\n\\[ 52 \\div 11 = 4 \\text{ breaks with a remainder of } 8 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThis means that there are 4 breaks of 1 hour each, and the remaining 8 hours are spent traveling without any breaks. Therefore, the total time spent on breaks in the remaining part of the journey is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 1 = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nAdding the breaks from the initial part of the journey to the breaks from the remaining part, we get the total time spent on breaks:\n\\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total time the spaceship was not moving is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",

        "To determine the total time the spaceship was not moving during its journey, we need to break down the journey into segments and calculate the break time for each segment.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total travel time and break time for the initial part of the journey:\n1. The spaceship travels for 10 hours, then stops for 3 hours.\n2. The spaceship travels for another 10 hours, then stops for 1 hour.\n3. After this, the spaceship takes an hour's break after every 11 hours of traveling.\n\nThe total time for the initial part of the journey is:\n\\[10 + 3 + 10 + 1 = 24 \\text{ hours}\\]\nThis means after 24 hours, the spaceship has completed the first two segments of its journey and has taken a total break of:\n\\[3 + 1 = 4 \\text{ hours}\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much time is left in the journey after the initial 24 hours. Since the entire journey took 3 days, we convert 3 days into hours:\n\\[3 \\text{ days} = 3 \\times 24 = 72 \\text{ hours}\\]\nSubtracting the time already traveled from the total journey time, we get:\n\\[72 - 24 = 48 \\text{ hours}\\]\nSo, the spaceship has 48 hours left to travel.\n\nNow, we need to calculate how many 11-hour travel segments fit into the remaining 48 hours and how many breaks the spaceship will take.

The total travel time for the 4 full segments is:\n\\[4 \\times 11 = 44 \\text{ hours}\\]\nSo, the total travel time for the entire journey is:\n\\[24 + 44 + 4 = 72 \\text{ hours}\\]\nThe total break time for the 4 segments is:\n\\[4 \\times 1 = 4 \\text{ hours}\\]\nAdding the break time from the initial part of the journey, the total break time is:\n\\[4 + 4 = 8 \\text{ hours}\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time the spaceship was not moving is:\n\\[\\boxed{8}\\]",

It stopped for 1 hour.\n\nAdding these segments together:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ hours} + 3 \\text{ hours} + 10 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 24 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSo, the first 24 hours of the journey include:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many complete 11-hour travel segments fit into the remaining 48 hours (since \\(72 - 24 = 48\\)).\n\nEach complete cycle consists of 11 hours of travel and 1 hour of break:\n\\[\n11 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 12 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many complete cycles fit into 48 hours:\n\\[\n\\frac{48}{12} = 4\n\\]\n\nEach complete cycle includes 1 hour of break. Therefore, 4 complete cycles include:\n\\[\n4 \\times 1 = 4 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nAdding the breaks from the initial part of the journey and the complete cycles:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ hours} + 4 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time the spaceship was not moving is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",
        "To determine how long the spaceship was not moving during its entire journey, we need to break down the journey into segments and calculate the total time spent stopped.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time spent书 הסיפור and stopped in the initial two segments:\n1. The spaceship traveled for 10 hours, then stopped for 3 hours.\n2. The spaceship traveled for another 10 hours, then stopped for 1 hour.\n\nThe total time spent traveling in these two segments is:\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe total time spent stopped in these two segments is:\n\\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much time is left after these two segments. The entire journey took 3 days, which is equivalent to:\n\\[ 3 \\times 24 = 72 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nAfter the first two segments, the remaining time is:\n\\[ 72 - 24 = 48 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe spaceship then follows a routine of traveling for 11 hours and stopping for 1 hour. We need to find out how many complete cycles of this routine fit into the remaining 48 hours. Each cycle consists of 11 hours of traveling and 1 hour of stopping, so each cycle is:\n\\[ 11 + 1 = 12 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe number of complete cycles that fit into 48 hours is:\n\\[ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{48}{12} \\right\\rfloor = 4 \\text{ cycles} \\]\n\nThe total time spent traveling in these 4 cycles is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 11 = 44 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe total time spent stopped in these 4 cycles is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 1 = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nAdding the time spent stopped in the initial two segments and the time spent stopped in the 4 cycles, the total time the spaceship was not moving is:\n\\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total time the spaceship was not moving is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",
        "To determine how long the spaceship was not moving over the course of its journey, we need to break down the journey into segments and calculate the total break time.\n\nFirst, let's convert the total journey time into hours:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ days} = 3 \\times 24 \\text{ hours} = 72 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we analyze the initial part of the journey:\n1.

        "To determine how long the spaceship was not moving during its journey, we need to break down the journey into segments and calculate the total time spent stopped.\n\nFirst, let's convert the total journey time from days to hours:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ days} = 3 \\times 24 = 72 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we analyze the initial part of the journey:\n1. The spaceship traveled for 10 hours.\n2. It stopped for 3 hours.\n3. It traveled for another 10 hours.\n4.

We need to determine how many such breaks occur in the remaining 48 hours.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many 11-hour intervals fit into the remaining 48 hours:\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{48}{11} \\right\\rfloor = 4\n\\]\nThis means there are 4 intervals of 11 hours in 48 hours. Since the spaceship takes a break after each interval, there are 4 breaks.\n\nEach break lasts 1 hour, so the total time spent on breaks in the remaining 48 hours is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 1 = 4 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the time spent on breaks from the initial part of the journey to the time spent on breaks in the remaining part of the journey:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} + 4 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time the spaceship was not moving during its entire journey is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",

Since each break is 1 hour, the total time spent on breaks in the remaining part of the journey is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ breaks} \\times 1 \\text{ hour/break} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nAdding the breaks from the initial part of the journey to the breaks from the remaining part of the journey gives us the total time the spaceship was not moving:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ hours} + 4 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time the spaceship was not moving is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",
