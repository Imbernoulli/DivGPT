Since each cat's vet fee is $13 and three families adopt cats, the total vet fees for the cats is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we sum the total vet fees paid for both dogs and cats:\n\\[ 120 + 39 = 159 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe vet donates a third of the total vet fees paid back to the shelter. Therefore, the amount donated by the vet is:\n\\[ \\frac{159}{3} = 53 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the vet donated \\(\\boxed{53}\\) dollars.",
