        "To determine how many more words Isaiah can type than Micah in an hour, we need to calculate the number of words each person can type in that time and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of words Micah can type in an hour. Micah types at a rate of 20 words per minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find the total number of words Micah types in an hour by multiplying his typing rate by 60:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ words/minute} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = 1200 \\text{ words}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of words Isaiah can type in an hour. Isaiah types at a rate of 40 words per minute. Similarly, we can find the total number of words Isaiah types in an hour by multiplying his typing rate by 60:\n\\[\n40 \\text{ words/minute} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = 2400 \\text{ words}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more words Isaiah can type than Micah. We do this by subtracting the number of words Micah types in an hour from the number of words Isaiah types in an hour:\n\\[\n2400 \\text{ words} - 1200 \\text{ words} = 1200 \\text{ words}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Isaiah can type \\(\\boxed{1200}\\) more words than Micah in an hour.",

Since Isaiah types 40 words per minute, we multiply his typing speed by the number of minutes in an hour:\n\\[\n40 \\text{ words/minute} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = 2400 \\text{ words}\n\\]\nSo, Isaiah can type 2400 words in an hour.\n\nTo find out how many more words Isaiah can type than Micah, we subtract the number of words Micah can type from the number of words Isaiah can type:\n\\[\n2400 \\text{ words} - 1200 \\text{ words} = 1200 \\text{ words}\n\\]\nTherefore, Isaiah can type \\(\\boxed{1200}\\) more words than Micah in an hour.",
