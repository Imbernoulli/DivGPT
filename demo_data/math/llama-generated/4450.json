        "To determine the tree's total height after 4 months, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of weeks in 4 months.\n2. Determine how much the tree grows in those weeks.\n3. Add the growth to the tree's current height.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of weeks in 4 months. Since each month is 4 weeks long, we multiply the number of months by the number of weeks per month:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ months} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 16 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how much the tree grows in 16 weeks. The tree grows at a rate of 2 feet per week, so we multiply the number of weeks by the growth rate per week:\n\\[\n16 \\text{ weeks} \\times 2 \\text{ feet/week} = 32 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the growth to the tree's current height. The tree is currently 10 feet tall, so we add the growth of 32 feet to the current height:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ feet} + 32 \\text{ feet} = 42 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the tree's total height after 4 months is \\boxed{42}.",

We add the total growth to the initial height:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ feet} + 32 \\text{ feet} = 42 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nThus, the tree's total height after 4 months is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",
        "To determine the tree's total height after 4 months, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of weeks in 4 months.\n2. Determine the total growth of the tree over those weeks.\n3. Add the total growth to the tree's current height.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of weeks in 4 months. Since each month is 4 weeks long, we have:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ months} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 16 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much the tree grows in 16 weeks. The tree grows at a rate of 2 feet per week, so:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ weeks} \\times 2 \\text{ feet/week} = 32 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNow, we add the total growth to the tree's current height. The tree is currently 10 feet tall, so:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ feet} + 32 \\text{ feet} = 42 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, the tree's total height after 4 months is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",
