        "To determine how many minutes Jenna can tan in the last two weeks of the month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of minutes Jenna tans in the first two weeks.\n2. Subtract this total from the maximum allowed tanning minutes for the month to find out how many minutes she can tan in the last two weeks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of minutes Jenna tans in the first two weeks. She tans 30 minutes a day, two days a week. Therefore, the number of minutes she tans in one week is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days/week} = 60 \\text{ minutes/week} \\]\n\nSince she tans for the first two weeks, the total number of minutes she tans in the first two weeks is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ minutes/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total number of minutes she tans in the first two weeks from the maximum allowed tanning minutes for the month:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ minutes} - 120 \\text{ minutes} = 80 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of minutes Jenna can tan in the last two weeks of the month is:\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]",
        "To determine how many minutes Jenna can tan in the last two weeks of the month, we need to calculate the total amount of time she has already tanned in the first two weeks and then subtract that from the monthly limit of 200 minutes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total tanning time for the first two weeks:\n- Jenna tans 30 minutes a day, two days a week.\n- In one week, she tans \\(30 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days/week} = 60 \\text{ minutes/week}\\).\n- For the first two weeks, she tans \\(60 \\text{ minutes/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 120 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\nNext, we subtract the total tanning time for the first two weeks from the monthly limit:\n- The monthly limit is 200 minutes.\n- The tanning time for the first two weeks is 120 minutes.\n- Therefore, the remaining tanning time for the last two weeks is \\(200 \\text{ minutes} - 120 \\text{ minutes} = 80 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\nSo, Jenna can tan \\(\\boxed{80}\\) minutes in the last two weeks of the month.",

        "To determine how many minutes Jenna can tan in the last two weeks of the month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of minutes Jenna tans in the first two weeks of the month.\n2. Subtract the minutes tanned in the first two weeks from the monthly limit of 200 minutes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of minutes Jenna tans in the first two weeks. She tans 30 minutes a day, two days a week. Therefore, the number of minutes she tans in one week is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days/week} = 60 \\text{ minutes/week} \\]\n\nSince she tans for the first two weeks, the total number of minutes she tans in the first two weeks is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ minutes/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the minutes tanned in the first two weeks from the monthly limit of 200 minutes:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ minutes} - 120 \\text{ minutes} = 80 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jenna can tan \\(\\boxed{80}\\) minutes in the last two weeks of the month."
