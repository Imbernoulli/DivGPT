Each set of clothes consists of a woolen hat, a scarf, a sweater, a pair of mittens, and a pair of wooly socks. She can knit a hat in 2 hours. A scarf takes her 3 hours. Each mitten takes her about an hour to knit. A sock takes an hour and a half. Each sweater takes her 6 hours. How long will it take her to knit all the outfits?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total time Martha will take to knit all the outfits for her grandchildren, we need to calculate the time required to knit one set of clothes and then multiply that by 3, since she has three grandchildren.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes to knit one set of clothes. The set consists of:\n- 1 hat\n- 1 scarf\n- 1 sweater\n- 2 mittens\n- 2 socks\n\nThe time required for each item is:\n- Hat: 2 hours\n- Scarf: 3 hours\n- Sweater: 6 hours\n- Mittens: 1 hour per mitten, so 2 mittens take \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) hours\n- Socks: 1.5 hours per sock, so 2 socks take \\(2 \\times 1.5 = 3\\) hours\n\nNow, we sum up the times for all the items in one set:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ (hat)} + 3 \\text{ (scarf)} + 6 \\text{ (sweater)} + 2 \\text{ (mittens)} + 3 \\text{ (socks)} = 16 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSince Martha has three grandchildren, she needs to knit 3 sets of clothes.
