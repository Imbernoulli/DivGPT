        "To determine the time it will take to travel from Edmonton to Calgary, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance between Edmonton and Calgary.\n2. Use the given speed to find the travel time.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total distance**\n\nEdmonton is 220 kilometers north of Red Deer, and Calgary is 110 kilometers south of Red Deer. Therefore, the total distance from Edmonton to Calgary is the sum of the distances from Edmonton to Red Deer and from Red Deer to Calgary.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = 220 \\text{ km} + 110 \\text{ km} = 330 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Use the given speed to find the travel time**\n\nThe speed of travel is 110 kilometers per hour. To find the travel time, we divide the total distance by the speed.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Travel time} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{330 \\text{ km}}{110 \\text{ km/h}} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take \\boxed{3} hours to get from Edmonton to Calgary.",
