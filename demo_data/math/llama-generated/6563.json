        "To find out how much Gondor earns in total, we need to calculate his earnings from repairing phones and laptops each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate his earnings from repairing phones:\n- On Monday, he repaired 3 phones. Since he earns $10 per phone, his earnings for Monday are:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- On Tuesday, he repaired 5 phones. So, his earnings for Tuesday are:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 10 = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate his earnings from repairing laptops:\n- On Wednesday, he repaired 2 laptops. Since he earns $20 per laptop, his earnings for Wednesday are:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- On Thursday, he repaired 4 laptops. So, his earnings for Thursday are:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 20 = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum up his earnings from all the days:\n\\[\n30 + 50 + 40 + 80 = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Gondor earns a total of \\boxed{200} dollars.",
