        "To determine the total number of sharks Mabel counted over the two days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of fish Mabel counted on day two.\n2. Find the total number of fish counted over both days.\n3. Determine the number of sharks based on the percentage of fish that are sharks.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of fish Mabel counted on day two.**\n\nOn day one, Mabel counts 15 fish. On day two, she counts three times as many fish as she did on day one.\n\\[\n3 \\times 15 = 45\n\\]\nSo, on day two, Mabel counts 45 fish.\n\n**Step 2: Find the total number of fish counted over both days.**\n\nAdd the number of fish counted on day one to the number of fish counted on day two.\n\\[\n15 + 45 = 60\n\\]\nSo, the total number of fish counted over both days is 60.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of sharks based on the percentage of fish that are sharks.**\n\nWe know that 25% of the fish are sharks. Therefore, we need to find 25% of 60.\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 60 = 15\n\\]\nSo, the total number of sharks Mabel counted over the two days is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",

Determine the total number of fish counted over the two days.\n3. Calculate the number of sharks based on the percentage of fish that are sharks.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of fish Mabel counted on day 2.**\n\nOn day 1, Mabel counted 15 fish. On day 2, she counted three times as many fish as she did on day 1.\n\\[\n15 \\times 3 = 45\n\\]\nSo, Mabel counted 45 fish on day 2.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of fish counted over the two days.**\n\nAdd the number of fish counted on day 1 to the number of fish counted on day 2.\n\\[\n15 + 45 = 60\n\\]\nSo, Mabel counted a total of 60 fish over the two days.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of sharks based on the percentage of fish that are sharks.**\n\nWe know that 25% of the fish Mabel sees are sharks. Therefore, we need to find 25% of 60.\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 60 = 15\n\\]\nSo, Mabel counted 15 sharks over the two days.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]"
