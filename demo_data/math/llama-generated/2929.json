        "To determine how many goats Ahmed has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find out how many goats Andrew has:**\n   - Adam has 7 goats.\n   - Andrew has 5 more than twice as many goats as Adam.\n   - Twice as many goats as Adam is \\( 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\).\n   - Adding 5 to this number gives \\( 14 + 5 = 19 \\).\n\n   Therefore, Andrew has 19 goats.\n\n2. **Find out how many goats Ahmed has:**\n   - Ahmed has 6 fewer goats than Andrew.\n   - Andrew has 19 goats.\n   - Subtracting 6 from this number gives \\( 19 - 6 = 13 \\).\n\n   Therefore, Ahmed has 13 goats.\n\nThus, the number of goats Ahmed has is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",
        "To determine how many goats Ahmed has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, find out how many goats Andrew has.\n2. Then, use the number of goats Andrew has to find out how many goats Ahmed has.\n\nLet's start with Adam. Adam has 7 goats.\n\nNext, we calculate how many goats Andrew has. According to the problem, Andrew has 5 more than twice as many goats as Adam. So, we first find twice the number of goats Adam has:\n\\[ 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\]\nThen, we add 5 to this result:\n\\[ 14 + 5 = 19 \\]\nTherefore, Andrew has 19 goats.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many goats Ahmed has. The problem states that Ahmed has 6 fewer goats than Andrew. So, we subtract 6 from the number of goats Andrew has:\n\\[ 19 - 6 = 13 \\]\nTherefore, Ahmed has 13 goats.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]",
