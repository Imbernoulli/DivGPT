        "To determine how many barrels of water are left for the fourth neighborhood, we need to calculate the water usage of the first three neighborhoods and subtract that total from the total amount of water in the water tower.\n\n1. **First neighborhood:**\n   The first neighborhood uses 150 barrels of water in a week.\n\n2. **Second neighborhood:**\n   The second neighborhood uses twice as many barrels of water as the first neighborhood.
