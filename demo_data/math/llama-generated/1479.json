        "To determine how much Sarah makes in an 8-hour day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how much Sarah earns per hour.\n2. Calculate Sarah's total earnings for an 8-hour day.\n\nFirst, we know that Sarah makes 5 times more money per hour than Connor does. Connor earns $7.20 per hour. Therefore, we can calculate Sarah's hourly wage as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Sarah's hourly wage} = 5 \\times 7.20 = 36.00 \\text{ dollars per hour} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much Sarah makes in an 8-hour day. We do this by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a day:\n\\[ \\text{Sarah's daily earnings} = 36.00 \\times 8 = 288.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the amount Sarah makes in an 8-hour day is \\(\\boxed{288}\\).",
