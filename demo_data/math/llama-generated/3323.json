        "To determine the total length of thread Roland needs, we start by calculating the additional length he requires. Roland already has a 12 cm long thread, and his teacher says he needs an additional three-quarters of what he has.\n\nFirst, we calculate three-quarters of 12 cm:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 12 = \\frac{3 \\times 12}{4} = \\frac{36}{4} = 9 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add this additional length to the original length of the thread:\n\\[\n12 + 9 = 21 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total length of thread required is \\(\\boxed{21}\\) cm.",
