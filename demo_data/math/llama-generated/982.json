        "To determine how many minutes it takes Jenna to hem her dress, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the length of the hem from feet to inches.\n2. Calculate the total number of stitches needed.\n3. Determine the time it takes to make all the stitches.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the length of the hem from feet to inches.**\n\nThe hem is 3 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert feet to inches by multiplying by 12:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 36 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of stitches needed.**\n\nEach stitch is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many stitches are needed to cover 36 inches, we divide the length of the hem by the length of each stitch:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ inches} \\div \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ inch/stitch} = 36 \\times 4 = 144 \\text{ stitches} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the time it takes to make all the stitches.**\n\nJenna makes 24 stitches per minute. To find out how many minutes it takes to make 144 stitches, we divide the total number of stitches by the number of stitches she makes per minute:\n\\[ 144 \\text{ stitches} \\div 24 \\text{ stitches/minute} = 6 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Jenna \\(\\boxed{6}\\) minutes to hem her dress.",
