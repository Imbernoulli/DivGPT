Since 40% of the 10 marbles are blue, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 10 = 4 \\text{ blue marbles} \\]\n\nThe rest of the marbles are red, so we have:\n\n\\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \\text{ red marbles} \\]\n\nPete keeps 1 red marble, so he will trade the remaining 5 red marbles with his friend. According to the trade Amp, Pete will receive 2 blue marbles for each red marble he trades. Therefore, for 5 red marbles, he will receive:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\text{ blue marbles} \\]\n\nAfter the trade, Pete will have the following number of marbles:\n- Blue marbles: He initially had 4 blue marbles and received 10 more, so he now has:\n\n\\[ 4 + 10 = 14 \\text{ blue marbles} \\]\n\n- Red marbles: He initially had 6 red marbles and kept 1, so he now has:\n\n\\[ 6 - 5 = 1 \\text{ red marble} \\]\n\nThe total number of marbles Pete has after the trade is:\n\n\\[ 14 + 1 = 15 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of marbles Pete has after trading with his friend is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
