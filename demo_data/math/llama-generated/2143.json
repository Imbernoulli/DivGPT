Since there are 40 winning tickets in total and 32 of them are for $5 and 1 is for $5,000, the number of other tickets is:\n\\[\n40 - 32 - 1 = 7\n\\]\n\\[\n7 \\times 10 = 70\n\\]\nSo, the total winnings from the other tickets is $70.\n\nAdding up all the winnings, we get:\n\\[\n160 + 5000 + 70 = 5230\n\\]\nSo, the total winnings is $5,230.\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total winnings to find the profit.**\n\n\\[\n5230 - 400 = 4830\n\\]\nSo, the profit is $4,830.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4830}\n\\]",
        "To determine James's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, the total winnings, and then find the difference between the winnings and the cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ tickets} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per ticket} = \\$400 \\]\n\nNext, let's determine how many of the tickets are winners. Since 20% of the tickets are winners:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ tickets} \\times 0.20 = 40 \\text{ winners} \\]\n\nNow, let's find out how many of these winners are for $5.
