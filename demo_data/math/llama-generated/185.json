Therefore, he will not hand in any money from the coins.\n\n5. **Final answer.**\n   The total amount of money Jack will be handing in is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{142}\n   \\]",
        "To determine how much money Jack will be handing in, we first need to calculate the total amount of money in the till in terms of notes. We will then subtract the $300 in notes from the total to find out how much money he will be handing in.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of each type of bill in the till:\n- The value of the $100 bills is \\(2 \\times 100 = 200\\) dollars.\n- The value of the $50 bill is \\(1 \\times 50 = 50\\) dollars.\n- The value of the $20 bills is \\(5 \\times 20 = 100\\) dollars.\n- The value of the $10 bills is \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\) dollars.\n- The value of the $5 bills is \\(7 \\times 5 = 35\\) dollars.\n- The value of the $1 bills is \\(27 \\times 1 = 27\\) dollars.\n\nNext, we sum up the values of all the notes:\n\\[200 + 50 + 100 + 30 + 35 + 27 = 442\\] dollars.\n\nJack is supposed to leave $300 in notes in the till. Therefore, the amount of money he will be handing in is:\n\\[442 - 300 = 142\\] dollars.\n\nSince the problem states that Jack is supposed to leave all the coins in the till and turn the rest in to the main office, the amount of money he will be handing in is \\(\\boxed{142}\\) dollars.",
        "First, let's calculate the total value of the notes in the till. We'll break it down by the denomination of each bill and then sum them up.\n\n1. The value of the $100 bills is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n2. The value of the $50 bill is:\n\\[ 1 \\times 50 = 50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n3. The value of the $20 bills is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 20 = 100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n4. The value of the $10 bills is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n5. The value of the $5 bills is:\n\\[ 7 \\times 5 = 35 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n6. The value of the $1 bills is:\n\\[ 27 \\times 1 = 27 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we sum up all these values to get the total value of the notes:\n\\[ 200 + 50 + 100 + 30 + 35 + 27 = 442 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nJack is supposed to leave $300 in notes in the till and turn in the rest. Therefore, the amount of money he will be handing in is:\n\\[ 442 - 300 = 142 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince the problem does not specify the value of the coins, the coins will remain in the till and will not be turned in. Thus, the amount of money Jack will be handing in is:\n\\[ \\boxed{142} \\]",
        "To determine how much money Jack will be handing in, we first need to calculate the total amount of money in notes in his till. We can do this by adding up the value of each type of bill.\n\n1. **$100 bills**: Jack has 2 $100 bills.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 100 = 200\n   \\]\n\n2. **$50 bill**: Jack has 1 $50 bill.\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 50 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **$20 bills**: Jack has 5 $20 bills.\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 20 = 100\n   \\]\n\n4. **$10 bills**: Jack has 3 $10 bills.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\n5. **$5 bills**: Jack has 7 $5 bills.\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 5 = 35\n   \\]\n\n6. **$1 bills**: Jack has 27 $1 bills.\n   \\[\n   27 \\times 1 = 27\n   \\]\n\nNext, we sum all these values to find the total amount of money in notes:\n\\[\n200 + 50 + 100 + 30 + 35 + 27\n\\]\n\nAdding these step-by-step:\n\\[\n200 + 50 = 250\n\\]\n\\[\n250 + 100 = 350\n\\]\n\\[\n350 + 30 = 380\n\\]\n\\[\n380 + 35 = 415\n\\]\n\\[\n415 + 27 = 442\n\\]\n\nSo, the total amount of money in notes is $442.\n\nJack is supposed to leave $300 in notes in the till. Therefore, the amount of money he needs to hand in is:\n\\[\n442 - 300 = 142\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Jack will be handing in is \\(\\boxed{142}\\).",

        "To determine how much money Jack will be handing in, we first need to calculate the total value of the notes in his till.
