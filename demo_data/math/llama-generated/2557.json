        "To determine the total number of loaves of bread the baker bakes in 3 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of loaves baked in one day for each type of day (weekdays and weekend days).\n\n**Weekdays:**\n- The baker bakes for 5 hours each weekday.\n- He has 4 ovens, and each oven bakes 5 loaves per hour.\n- Therefore, the number of loaves baked per hour in total is \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\) loaves.\n- So, the number of loaves baked in one weekday is \\(20 \\times 5 = 100\\) loaves.\n\nSince there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of loaves baked in a week from Monday to Friday is:\n\\[100 \\times 5 = 500 \\text{ loaves}\\]\n\n**Weekend days:**\n- The baker bakes for 2 hours each weekend day.\n- He has 4 ovens, and each oven bakes 5 loaves per hour.\n- Therefore, the number of loaves baked per hour in total is \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\) loaves.\n- So, the number of loaves baked in one weekend day is \\(20 \\times 2 = 40\\) loaves.\n\nSince there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of loaves baked in a week on Saturday and Sunday is:\n\\[40 \\times 2 = 80 \\text{ loaves}\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of loaves baked in one week:\n\\[500 + 80 = 580 \\text{ loaves}\\]\n\nSince we need to find out how many loaves are baked in 3 weeks, we multiply the number of loaves baked in one week by 3:\n\\[580 \\times 3 = 1740 \\text{ loaves}\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of loaves of bread the baker bakes in 3 weeks is \\(\\boxed{1740}\\).",
