        "To determine how many hours Jake had to work to pay off the rest of his debt, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the remaining debt after the partial payment:**\n   Jake originally owed $100. He paid $40.\n   \\[\n   100 - 40 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, Jake still owes $60.\n\n2. **Determine the hourly wage and the total number of hours needed:**\n   Jake earns $15 per hour.
