Horatio's lady fair listened to 7 sonnets, and he has 70 lines that she never heard. We can use this information to find out how many sonnets Horatio wrote in total.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of lines in the 7 sonnets that she heard:\n\\[\n7 \\text{ sonnets} \\times 14 \\text{ lines/sonnet} = 98 \\text{ lines}\n\\]\nNext, we know that there are 70 lines that she never heard. Therefore, the total number of lines in all the sonnets Horatio wrote is the sum of the lines she heard and the lines she did not hear:\n\\[\n98 \\text{ lines} + 70 \\text{ lines} = 168 \\text{ lines}\n\\]\nSince each sonnet is 14 lines long, we can find the total number of sonnets by dividing the total number of lines by the number of lines per sonnet:\n\\[\n168 \\text{ lines} \\div 14 \\text{ lines/sonnet} = 12 \\text{ sonnets}\n\\]\nThus, the total number of sonnets Horatio wrote is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
