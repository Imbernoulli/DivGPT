        "To determine the total number of animals Erica saw during her safari, we need to add up the number of animals she saw each day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of animals she saw on Saturday:\n- Erica saw 3 lions and 2 elephants.\n- Therefore, the total number of animals on Saturday is \\(3 + 2 = 5\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of animals she saw on Sunday:\n- Erica spotted 2 buffaloes and 5 leopards.\n- Therefore, the total number of animals on Sunday is \\(2 + 5 = 7\\).\n\nThen, let's calculate the number of animals she saw on Monday:\n- Erica spotted 5 rhinos and 3 warthogs.\n- Therefore, the total number of animals on Monday is \\(5 + 3 = 8\\).\n\nNow, we add up the total number of animals seen over the three days:\n- The total number of animals is \\(5 + 7 + 8 = 20\\).\n\nThus, the total number of animals that Erica saw is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
