        "To determine how much farther Margarita ran and jumped than Ricciana, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance Margarita ran and jumped.\n2. Subtract Ricciana's total distance from Margarita's total distance.\n\nFirst, let's find out how far Margarita jumped. Ricciana jumped 4 feet, and Margarita jumped 1 foot less than twice Ricciana's jump. So, we calculate:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate Margarita's total distance by adding her running distance and her jumping distance:\n\\[ 18 + 7 = 25 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNow, we know that Ricciana's total distance is 24 feet. To find out how much farther Margarita ran and jumped than Ricciana, we subtract Ricciana's total distance from Margarita's total distance:\n\\[ 25 - 24 = 1 \\text{ foot} \\]\n\nTherefore, Margarita ran and jumped \\(\\boxed{1}\\) foot farther than Ricciana.",

        "To determine how much farther Margarita ran and jumped than Ricciana, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Margarita's total distance for running and jumping.\n2. Subtract Ricciana's total distance from Margarita's total distance.\n\nFirst, let's find Margarita's total distance. Margarita ran for 18 feet and jumped 1 foot less than twice Ricciana's jump. Ricciana's jump was 4 feet, so twice Ricciana's jump is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ feet} \\]\nMargarita jumped 1 foot less than 8 feet, which is:\n\\[ 8 - 1 = 7 \\text{ feet} \\]\nTherefore, Margarita's total distance is:\n\\[ 18 + 7 = 25 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract Ricciana's total distance from Margarita's total distance.
