        "To determine how long it will take Jaime to save $135, we need to consider both her savings rate and her spending pattern. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Savings Rate:**\n   Jaime saves $50 each week.\n\n2. **Spending Pattern:**\n   Jaime spends $46 every two weeks on lunch with her mum.\n\n3. **Net Savings over Two Weeks:**\n   - In two weeks, Jaime saves:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 50 = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - In two weeks, she spends:\n     \\[\n     46 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, her net savings over two weeks is:\n     \\[\n     100 - 46 = 54 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Two-Week Periods Needed:**\n   Jaime needs to save a total of $135. To find out how many two-week periods she needs, we divide the total savings goal by the net savings per two weeks:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{135}{54} = 2.5 \\text{ two-week periods}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert Two-Week Periods to Weeks:**\n   Since each two-week period is 2 weeks, the total number of weeks needed is:\n   \\[\n   2.5 \\times 2 = 5 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jaime \\boxed{5} weeks to save $135.",
        "To determine how long it will take Jaime to save $135, we need to consider both her weekly savings and her bi-weekly expenses. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate Jaime's net savings every two weeks:**\n   - Jaime saves $50 each week. Therefore, in two weeks, she saves:\n     \\[\n     50 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Every two weeks, she spends $46 on a nice lunch with her mum. Therefore, her net savings every two weeks is:\n     \\[\n     100 \\text{ dollars} - 46 \\text{ dollars} = 54 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many two-week periods are needed to save $135:**\n   - To find out how many two-week periods it will take to save $135, we divide $135 by her net savings per two-week period:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{135 \\text{ dollars}}{54 \\text{ dollars/two-week period}} = 2.5 \\text{ two-week periods}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the number of two-week periods into weeks:**\n   - Since each two-week period is 2 weeks, 2.5 two-week periods is:\n     \\[\n     2.5 \\times 2 = 5 \\text{ weeks}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jaime \\(\\boxed{5}\\) weeks to save $135.",

        "To determine how long it will take Jaime to save $135, we need to consider both her savings and her expenses over time. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate Jaime's net savings every two weeks:**\n   - Jaime saves $50 each week.\n   - Over two weeks, she saves \\( 50 \\times 2 = 100 \\) dollars.\n   - Every two weeks, she spends $46 on lunch.\n   - Therefore, her net savings every two weeks is \\( 100 - 46 = 54 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Determine how many two-week periods are needed to save $135:**\n   - Jaime saves $54 every two weeks.\n   - We need to find out how many two-week periods are required to reach $135.\n   -我们将 $135 by $54 to get the number of two-week periods: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{135}{54} = 2.5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the number of two-week periods into weeks:**\n   - Since 2.5 two-week periods means \\( 2.5 \\times 2 = 5 \\) weeks.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jaime \\(\\boxed{5}\\) weeks to save $135.",
        "To determine how long it will take Jaime to save $135, we need to consider both her savings rate and her spending pattern. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Savings Rate**: Jaime saves $50 each week.\n2. **Spending Pattern**: Jaime spends $46 every two weeks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much Jaime saves in two weeks:\n\\[\n50 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount she spends every two weeks from her total savings over two weeks:\n\\[\n100 \\text{ dollars} - 46 \\text{ dollars} = 54 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo, Jaime saves $54 every two weeks.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many two-week periods it will take her to save $135. We do this by dividing $135 by the amount she saves in two weeks:\n\\[\n\\frac{135 \\text{ dollars}}{54 \\text{ dollars/two-week period}} = 2.5 \\text{ two-week periods}\n\\]\n\nSince Jaime cannot save for a fraction of a two-week period, we need to convert this to whole weeks.

        "To determine how long it will take Jaime to save $135, we need to account for both her savings and her expenses. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate Jaime's net savings every two weeks:**\n   - Jaime saves $50 each week.\n   - Over two weeks, she saves \\( 50 \\times 2 = 100 \\) dollars.\n   - She spends $46 every two weeks on lunch.\n   - Therefore, her net savings every two weeks is \\( 100 - 46 = 54 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Determine how many two-week periods are needed to save $135:**\n   - We need to find out how many two-week periods it will take to save $135.\n   - We do this by dividing $135 by her net savings per two-week period: \\( \\frac{135}{54} \\).\n\n3. **Perform the division:**\n   - \\( \\frac{135}{54} = 2.5 \\).\n\n4. **Convert the number of two-week periods into weeks:**\n   - Since each period is two weeks, we multiply the number of periods by 2: \\( 2.5 \\times 2 = 5 \\) weeks.\n\nTherefore, it will take Jaime \\(\\boxed{5}\\) weeks to save $135.",
        "To determine how long it will take Jaime to save $135, we need to consider both her savings and her expenditures. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate Jaime's net savings over two weeks:**\n   - Jaime saves $50 each week.\n   - Over two weeks, she saves \\( 50 \\times 2 = 100 \\) dollars.\n   - Every two weeks, she spends $46 on a lunch with her mum.\n   - Therefore, her net savings over two weeks is \\( 100 - 46 = 54 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Determine how many two-week periods are needed to save $135:**\n   - Jaime saves $54 every two weeks.\n   - To find out how many two-week periods are needed to save $135, we divide $135 by $54:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{135}{54} = 2.5\n     \\]\n   - This means Jaime needs 2.5 two-week periods to save $135.\n\n3. **Convert the number of two-week periods into weeks:**\n   - Since each period is 2 weeks, we multiply 2.5 by 2:\n     \\[\n     2.5 \\times 2 = 5\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jaime \\(\\boxed{5}\\) weeks to save $135.",

We do this by dividing $135 by her net savings over two weeks:\n\\[\n\\frac{135}{54} = 2.5\n\\]\n\nThis means it will take Jaime 2.5 two-week periods to save $135. Since each two-week period is 2 weeks, we multiply 2.5 by 2:\n\\[\n2.5 \\times 2 = 5 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take Jaime \\boxed{5} weeks to save $135.",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Weekly Savings Calculation:**\n   Jaime saves $50 each week.\n\n2. ** bi-weekly Expenses Calculation:**\n   Jaime spends $46 every two weeks.\n\n3. **Net Savings Over Two Weeks:**\n   - In two weeks, Jaime saves \\( 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\) dollars.\n   - In two weeks, she spends $46.\n   - Therefore, her net savings over two weeks is \\( 100 - 46 = 54 \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Determine Number of Two-Week Periods Needed:**\n   Jaime needs to save $135. We divide her total savings goal by her net savings per two weeks:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{135}{54} = 2.5\n   \\]\n   This means Jaime needs 2.5 two-week periods to save $135.\n\n5. **Convert Two-Week Periods to Weeks:**\n   Since each two-week period is 2 weeks, we multiply the number of two-week periods by 2:\n   \\[\n   2.5 \\times 2 = 5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jaime \\(\\boxed{5}\\) weeks to save $135.",
        "To determine how long it will take Jaime to save $135, we need to consider her weekly savings and her bi-weekly expenses.\n\n1. **Weekly Savings**:\n   Jaime saves $50 each week.\n\n2. **Bi-Weekly Expenses**:\n   Every two weeks, she spends $46 on a lunch with her mum.\n\nLet's calculate her net savings over two weeks:\n- In two weeks, Jaime saves:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 50 = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- In two weeks, she spends $46.\n- Therefore, her net savings over two weeks is:\n  \\[\n  100 - 46 = 54 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many two-week periods are required to save $135. We do this by dividing $135 by her net savings per two-week period:\n\\[\n\\frac{135}{54} \\approx 2.5\n\\]\n\nSince Jaime cannot save for half a two-week period, we need to round up to the next whole number of two-week periods. Thus, she needs 3 two-week periods to save at least $135.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time in weeks:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ two-week periods} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks per period} = 6 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's verify the total savings over 6 weeks:\n- In 6 weeks, Jaime saves:\n  \\[\n  6 \\times 50 = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- In 6 weeks (which is 3 two-week periods), she spends:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 46 = 138 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- Therefore, her net savings over 6 weeks is:\n  \\[\n  300 - 288 = 138 \\text{ dollars}\n  secretion*Math…\"

        "To determine how long it will take Jaime to save $135, we need to consider both her savings rate and her spending pattern.\n\n1. **Savings Rate:**\n   Jaime saves $50 each week.\n\n2. **Spending Pattern:**\n   Jaime spends $46 every two weeks.\n\n3. **Net Savings over Two Weeks:**\n   - In two weeks, Jaime saves \\( 50 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 100 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n   - In two weeks, she spends $46.\n   - Therefore, her net savings over two weeks is \\( 100 \\text{ dollars} - 46 \\text{ dollars} = 54 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Two-Week Periods:**\n   To find out how many two-week periods Jaime needs to save $135, we divide $135 by her net savings per two weeks:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{135 \\text{ dollars}}{54 \\text{ dollars/two-week period}} \\approx 2.5 \\text{ two-week periods}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert Two-Week Periods to Weeks:**\n   Since each period is two weeks, we multiply the number of two-week periods by

and spends $46, netming $54.\n   - In the next two weeks, she saves another $100 and spends $46, netming another $54.\n   - In the fifth week, she saves $50 but does not spend anything\t
