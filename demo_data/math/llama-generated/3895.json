        "To determine how many times the poodle barked, we start by analyzing the barking pattern and the actions of the terrier's owner.\n\n1. The poodle barks twice for every one time the terrier barks.\n2. The terrier's owner hushes the terrier every second time it barks.\n3. The owner has to say \"hush\" six times before the dogs stopped barking.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of times the terrier barked. Since the owner hushes the terrier every second time it barks and she says \"hush\" six times, the terrier must have barked:\n\\[\n6 \\times 2 = 12 \\text{ times}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many times the poodle barked.
