Since strawberries are sold in 2 cup packages, she will need:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4 \\text{ cups}}{2 \\text{ cups/package}} = 2 \\text{ packages}\n  \\]\n- Each package of strawberries costs $3.00, so the total cost for strawberries is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ packages} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/package} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- Martha also needs 2 cups of heavy cream.
