        "To determine how much Abraham spent on the box of laundry detergent, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of the 4 shower gels. Each shower gel costs $4, so the total cost for the shower gels is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ shower gels} \\times \\$4 \\text{ per shower gel} = \\$16 \\]\n\nNext, we add the cost of the tube of toothpaste, which is $3:\n\\[ \\$16 + \\$3 = \\$19 \\]\n\nLet's denote the cost of the box of laundry detergent as \\( x \\). According to the problem, after buying the shower gels and the toothpaste, and after buying the laundry detergent, Abraham has $30 left from his $60 budget. Therefore, the total amount of money he has spent is:\n\\[ \\$60 - \\$30 = \\$30 \\]\n\nThis total spent amount is the sum of the cost of the shower gels, the toothpaste, and the laundry detergent:\n\\[ \\$19 + x = \\$30 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ x = \\$30 - \\$19 = \\$11 \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Abraham spent on the box of laundry detergent is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]",

        "To determine how much Abraham spent on the box of laundry detergent, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he spent on the other items he bought. Abraham's budget is $60 and he has $30 remaining after his shopping. Therefore, the amount he spent on all the items is:\n\n\\[ 60 - 30 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the shower gels. Abraham bought 4 shower gels, each costing $4:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nHe also bought a tube of toothpaste for $3. Adding the cost of the toothpaste to the cost of the shower gels, we get:\n\n\\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe remaining amount of money he spent is on the box of laundry detergent. Since he spent a total of $30 and $19 on the shower gels and toothpaste, the amount he spent on the laundry detergent is:\n\n\\[ 30 - 19 = 11 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Abraham spent on the box of laundry detergent is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]",

According to the problem, after buying all the items, Abraham has $30 remaining from his $60 budget.
