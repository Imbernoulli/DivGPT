        "To determine the combined total time Jonathan spends exercising in a week, we need to calculate the time he spends on each exercise day and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time he spends on Mondays. On Mondays, he walks at a speed of 2 miles per hour and travels 6 miles. The time spent is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values for Monday:\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_{\\text{Monday}} = \\frac{6 \\text{ miles}}{2 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time he spends on Wednesdays. On Wednesdays, he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour and travels 6 miles. Using the same formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_{\\text{Wednesday}} = \\frac{6 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the time he spends on Fridays. On Fridays, he runs at a speed of 6 miles per hour and travels 6 miles. Using the same formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_{\\text{Friday}} = \\frac{6 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the times spent on each exercise day to find the total time spent exercising in a week:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\text{Time}_{\\text{Monday}} + \\text{Time}_{\\text{Wednesday}} + \\text{Time}_{\\text{Friday}} = 3 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the combined total time Jonathan spends exercising in a week is \\(\\boxed{6}\\) hours.",
