        "Let's define the ages of the characters using variables. Let \\( P \\) be the age of Peter Parker. Then, the age of Captain America is \\( 7P \\) because Captain America is 7 times older than Peter Parker. The age of Thor is \\( 13 \\times 7P = 91P \\) because Thor is 13 times older than Captain America. We know that Thor is 1456 years old, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 91P = 1456 \\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 91:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{1456}{91} = 16 \\]\n\nSo, Peter Parker is 16 years old.
