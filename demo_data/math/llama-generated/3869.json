Calculate the total number of brownies baked.\n   Melanie baked 10 batches of brownies, with 20 brownies in each batch.\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 20 = 200\n   \\]\n   So, the total number of brownies baked is 200.\n\n2. Determine how many brownies were set aside for the bake sale.\n   Melanie set aside \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the brownies in each batch for the bake sale. Since there are 20 brownies in each batch, the number of brownies set aside from each batch is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\times 20 = 15\n   \\]\n   Since there are 10 batches, the total number of brownies set aside for the bake sale is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 15 = 150\n   \\]\n   So, 150 brownies were set aside for the bake sale.\n\n3. Find out how many brownies remained after setting aside some for the bake sale.\n   The total number of brownies baked is 200, and 150 were set aside. Therefore, the number of brownies remaining is:\n   \\[\n   200 - 150 = 50\n   \\]\n\n4. Determine how many of the remaining brownies were put in a container.\n   Melanie put \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the remaining brownies in a container. So, the number of brownies put in a container is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{5} \\times 50 = 30\n   \\]\n\n5. Calculate the number of brownies given out.\n   The number of brownies given out is the number of remaining brownies after putting some in a container. Since 50 brownies remained and 30 were put in a container, the number of brownies given out is:\n   \\[\n   50 - 30 = 20\n   \\]\n\nSo, the number of brownies given out is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
