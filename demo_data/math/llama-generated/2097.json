        "To determine how much money John has left after giving some to his mother and father, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of money John gave to his mother.\n2. Calculate the amount of money John gave to his father.\n3. Subtract the amounts given to his mother and father from the original amount of money John had.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount of money John gave to his mother.**\n\nJohn gave \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) of his $200 to his mother.\n\\[\n\\text{Amount given to mother} = \\frac{3}{8} \\times 200\n\\]\nTo perform the multiplication, we can simplify:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8} \\times 200 = \\frac{3 \\times 200}{8} = \\frac{600}{8} = 75\n\\]\nSo, John gave $75 to his mother.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the amount of money John gave to his father.**\n\nJohn gave \\( \\frac{3}{10} \\) of his $200 to his father.\n\\[\n\\text{Amount given to father} = \\frac{3}{10} \\times 200\n\\]\nTo perform the multiplication:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{10} \\times 200 = \\frac{3 \\times 200}{10} = \\frac{600}{10} = 60\n\\]\nSo, John gave $60 to his father.\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the amounts given to his mother and father from the original amount of money John had.**\n\nJohn originally had $200. After giving $75 to his mother and $60 to his father, the amount of money he has left is:\n\\[\n\\text{Money left} = 200 - 75 - 60\n\\]\nFirst, subtract $75 from $200:\n\\[\n200 - 75 = 125\n\\]\nThen, subtract $60 from $125:\n\\[\n125 - 60 = 65\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money John has left is \\(\\boxed{65}\\).",

John gave \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) of his $200 to his mother:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount given to mother} = \\frac{3}{8} \\times 200 = \\frac{3 \\times 200}{8} = \\frac{600}{8} = 75\n\\]\nSo, John gave $75 to his mother.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much money John gave to his father.
