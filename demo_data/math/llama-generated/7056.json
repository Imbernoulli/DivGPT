        "To determine the total number of plugs, we start by finding out how many pairs of plugs were originally in the box. We know that the box of mittens has 20 fewer pairs than the box of plugs. Let's denote the original number of pairs of plugs as \\( p \\). According to the problem, the box of mittens has 150 pairs of mittens, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ p - 20 = 150 \\]\n\nTo find \\( p \\), we add 20 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ p = 150 + 20 \\]\n\\[ p = 170 \\]\n\nSo, the original number of pairs of plugs is 170. Next, we are told that Gunner adds 30 more pairs of plugs to the box. Therefore, the new number of pairs of plugs is:\n\n\\[ 170 + 30 = 200 \\]\n\nSince each pair of plugs consists of 2 plugs, the total number of plugs is:\n\n\\[ 200 \\times 2 = 400 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of plugs is \\(\\boxed{400}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of plugs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the initial number of pairs of plugs:**\n   - The box of mittens has 150 pairs.\n   - There are 20 fewer pairs of mittens than plugs.\n   - Let \\( P \\) represent the initial number of pairs of plugs.\n   - Therefore, we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     150 = P - 20\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\( P \\):**\n   - Add 20 to both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     150 + 20 = P\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     P = 170\n     \\]\n\n3. **Add the additional pairs of plugs:**\n   - Gunner adds 30 more pairs of plugs to the box.\n   - The new total number of pairs of plugs is:\n     \\[\n     P + 30 = 170 + 30\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     P + 30 = 200\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert pairs of plugs to individual plugs:**\n   - Each pair consists of 2 plugs.\n   - Therefore, the total number of individual plugs is:\n     \\[\n     200 \\times 2 = 400\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of plugs is \\(\\boxed{400}\\).",
