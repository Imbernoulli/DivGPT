        "To determine how many seconds Xena has to get to the cave before the dragon can burn her, we need to calculate the time it takes for the dragon to close the gap between itself and Xena to within 120 feet.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial gap between Xena and the dragon:\n\\[\n\\text{Initial gap} = 600 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThe dragon can burn Xena if it gets within 120 feet of her. Therefore, the dragon needs to cover:\n\\[\n\\text{ Tibierarchical distance} = 600 \\text{ feet} - 120 \\text{ feet} = 480 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the relative speed at which the dragon is closing the gap. The dragon flies at 30 feet per second, and Xena runs at 15 feet per second. The relative speed is the difference between their speeds:\n\\[\n\\text{Relative speed} = 30 \\text{ feet per second} - 15 \\text{ feet per second} = 15 \\text{ feet per second}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the time it takes for the dragon to cover the 480 feet at the relative speed of 15 feet per second:\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{480 \\text{ feet}}{15 \\text{ feet per second}} = 32 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Xena has \\boxed{32} seconds to get to the cave before the dragon can burn her."
