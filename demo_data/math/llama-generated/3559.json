        "To determine how many NBA players are younger than 25 years, we start by calculating the number of players in each age group based on the given fractions of the total number of players.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of players aged between 25 and 35 years. We know that exactly two-fifths of the players fall into this age group:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of players aged between 25 and 35} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 1000 = 400\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of players older than 35 years.

We do this by subtracting the number of players aged between 25 and 35 years and the number of players older than 35 years from the total number of players:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of players younger than 25} = 1000 - 400 - 375 = 225\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of players younger than 25 years is \\(\\boxed{225}\\).",
        "To determine how many NBA players are younger than 25 years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of players aged between 25 and 35 years:**\n\n   Given that two-fifths of the players are aged between 25 and 35 years, we use the total number of players who signed up:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of players aged between 25 and 35} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 1000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{2 \\times 1000}{5} = \\frac{2000}{5} = 400\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of players older than 35 years:**\n\n   Given that three-eighths of the players are older than 35 years, we use the total number of players who signed up:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of players older than 35} = \\frac{3}{8} \\times 1000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{3 \\times 1000}{8} = \\frac{3000}{8} = 375\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of players younger than 25 years:**\n\n   The total number of players is the sum of players aged between 25 and 35 years, players older than 35 years, and players younger than 25 years. We already know the total number of players is 1000. Let \\( x \\) be the number of players younger than 25 years. We set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   400 + 375 + x = 1000\n   \\]\n\n   Combine the known values:\n   \\[\n   775 + x = 1000\n   \\]\n\n   Solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 1000 - 775 = 225\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of players younger than 25 years is \\(\\boxed{225}\\).",

Since two-fifths of the players fall into this age range, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times 1000 = 400\n\\]\nSo, there are 400 players aged between 25 and 35 years.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of players older than 35 years. Since three-eighths of the players are older than 35, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8} \\times 1000 = 375\n\\]\nSo, there are 375 players older than 35 years.\n\nNow, we can find the number of players younger than 25 years by subtracting the number of players aged between 25 and 35 years and the number of players older than 35 years from the total number of players. The total number of players is 1000, so we calculate:\n\\[\n1000 - 400 - 375 = 225\n\\]\nSo, the number of players younger than 25 years is \\boxed{225}.",
