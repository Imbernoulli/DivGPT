He needs to drain all of them and put them in the recycling bin. He can carry four cans at once, and it takes him 30 seconds to drain those 4 cans. It takes him ten seconds each way to walk to the sink and recycling bin and then back to his desk. If there are 28 cans on Jerry's desk, how long does it take him to throw all of them away?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Therefore, the time taken for one trip is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ seconds} + 10 \\text{ seconds} = 20 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n   Since he makes 7 trips, the total time to walk to the sink and back to the desk is:\n   \\[\n   7 \\text{ trips} \\times 20 \\text{ seconds/trip} = 140 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total time taken:**\n   The total time taken to throw all the cans away is the sum of the time taken to drain the cans and the time taken to walk to the sink and back to the desk:\n   \\[\n   210 \\text{ seconds} + 140 \\text{ seconds} = 350 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes Jerry to throw all the cans away is \\(\\boxed{350}\\) seconds.",
        "To determine how long it takes Jerry to throw away all 28 cans, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate the time for each step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of trips Jerry needs to make:**\n   Jerry can carry 4 cans at once. Therefore, the number of trips he needs to make is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{28 \\text{ cans}}{4 \\text{ cans/trip}} = 7 \\text{ trips}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the time taken for each trip:**\n   Each trip consists of three parts:\n   - Walking to the sink and recycling bin (10 seconds)\n   --write-(10 seconds)\n   - Drain the cans (30 seconds)\n\n   The total time for one trip is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ seconds} + 10 \\text{ seconds} + 30 \\text{ seconds} = 50 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total time for all trips:**\n   Since Jerry makes 7 trips, the total time taken is:\n   \\[\n   7 \\text{ trips} \\times 50 \\text{ seconds/trip} = 350 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total time it takes Jerry to throw all 28 cans away is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{350}\n\\]"
