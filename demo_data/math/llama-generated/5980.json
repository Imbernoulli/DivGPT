        "To determine the number of students in the class, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pizza slices:**\n   The teacher orders 6 pizzas, and each pizza has 18 slices.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 18 = 108\n   \\]\n   So, there are 108 slices of pizza in total.\n\n2. **Determine the number of slices eaten:**\n   After eating, there are 8 pieces of cheese and 4 pieces of onion leftover. Since each student eats 2 pieces of cheese and 1 piece of onion, the leftover slices represent the slices that were not eaten.\n\n   First, let's find the total number of leftover slices:\n   \\[\n   8 + 4 = 12\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the number of slices eaten is:\n   \\[\n   108 - 12 = 96\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of students:**\n   Each student eats 3 slices of pizza (2 pieces of cheese and 1 piece of onion).\n   To find the number of students, divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices each student eats:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{96}{3} = 32\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of students in the class is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
