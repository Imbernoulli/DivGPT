        "To determine how many toy cars Bobby will have in three years, we need to calculate the increase in the number of toy cars each year based on a 50% increase.\n\n1. **Initial number of toy cars:**\n   Bobby starts with 16 toy cars.\n\n2. **First year:**\n   The number of toy cars increases by 50%. To find the increase, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   16 \\times 0.50 = 8\n   \\]\n   Adding this increase to the initial number:\n   \\[\n   16 + 8 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, after the first year, Bobby has 24 toy cars.\n\n3. **Second year:**\n   The number of toy cars again increases by 50%. To find the increase, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   24 \\times 0.50 = 12\n   \\]\n   Adding this increase to the number of toy cars after the first year:\n   \\[\n   24 + 12 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, after the second year, Bobby has 36 toy cars.\n\n4. **Third year:**\n   The number of toy cars increases by 50% again. To find the increase, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   36 \\times 0.50 = 18\n   \\]\n   Adding this increase to the number of toy cars after the second year:\n   \\[\n   36 + 18 = 54\n   \\]\n   So, after the third year, Bobby has 54 toy cars.\n\nTherefore, the number of toy cars Bobby will have in three years is \\boxed{54}.",

Therefore, the number of toy cars after the second year is:\n   \\[\n   24 + 0.5 \\times 24 = 24 \\times (1 + 0.5) = 24 \\times 1.5 = 36\n   \\]\n4. **After the third year**: The number of toy cars increases by 50% once more.

Therefore, the number of toy cars after the first year is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   16 + 0.5 \\times 16 = 16 + 8 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, after the first year, Bobby has 24 toy cars.\n3. **Second year**: The number of toy cars again increases by 50%. Therefore, the number of toy cars after the second year is:\n   \\[\n   24 + 0.5 \\times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, after the second year, Bobby has 36 toy cars.\n4. **Third year**: The number of toy cars increases by 50% once more. Therefore, the number of toy cars after the third year is:\n   \\[\n   36 + 0.5 \\times 36 = 36 + 18 = 54\n   \\]\n   So, after the third year, Bobby has 54 toy cars.\n\nThus, the number of toy cars Bobby will have in three years is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
        "To determine how many toy cars Bobby will have in three years, given that he starts with 16 toy cars and the number of cars increases by 50% each year, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of toy cars Bobby has after the first year.\n2. Calculate the number of toy cars Bobby has after the second year.\n3. Calculate the number of toy cars Bobby has after the third year.\n\nLet's start with the first year. The number of toy cars increases by 50%, so we need to find 50% of 16 and add it to the original number of toy cars:\n\\[ 16 \\times 0.50 = 8 \\]\n\\[ 16 + 8 = 24 \\]\nSo, after the first year, Bobby has 24 toy cars.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of toy cars Bobby has after the second year. Again, the number of toy cars increases by 50%, so we need to find 50% of 24 and add it to the current number of toy cars:\n\\[ 24 \\times 0.50 = 12 \\]\n\\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \\]\nSo, after the second year, Bobby has 36 toy cars.\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of toy cars Bobby has after the third year. The number of toy cars increases by 50%, so we need to find 50% of 36 and add it to the current number of toy cars:\n\\[ 36 \\times 0.50 = 18 \\]\n\\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \\]\nSo, after the third year, Bobby has 54 toy cars.\n\nTherefore, the number of toy cars Bobby will have in three years is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
