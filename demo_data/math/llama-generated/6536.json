        "To determine the total time Mr. John will have spent jogging after two weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the daily jogging time from hours and minutes to just hours.\n2. Calculate the total jogging time for one week.\n3. Calculate the total jogging time for two weeks.\n\nFirst, let's convert the daily jogging time from hours and minutes to just hours. Mr. John jogs for 1 hour 30 minutes each day. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can express this as:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ hour} + 0.5 \\text{ hour} = 1.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total jogging time for one week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily jogging time by 7:\n\\[ 1.5 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 10.5 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total jogging time for two weeks. There are 2 weeks, so we multiply the weekly jogging time by 2:\n\\[ 10.5 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 21 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Mr. John will have spent jogging after two weeks is \\(\\boxed{21}\\) hours.",

Mr. John jogs for 1 hour 30 minutes each day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 30 minutes into hours by dividing 30 by 60:\n\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{30}{60} \\text{ hours} = 0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, Mr. John jogs for:\n\n\\[ 1 \\text{ hour} + 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 1.5 \\text{ hours} \\text{ each day} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total jogging time for one week.

Therefore, the daily jogging time is:\n\\[ 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total jogging time for one week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total jogging time for one week is:\n\\[ 1.5 \\times 7 = 10.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total jogging time for two weeks. There are 2 weeks, so the total jogging time for two weeks is:\n\\[ 10.5 \\times 2 = 21 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total time Mr. John will have spent jogging after two weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]",
        "To determine how much time Mr. John will have spent jogging after two weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the daily jogging time into hours.\n2. Calculate the total jogging time over two weeks.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the daily jogging time into hours.**\n\nMr. John jogs for 1 hour 30 minutes each day. We know that 30 minutes is half an hour.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is equal to \\( \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \\) hours. Therefore, 1 hour 30 minutes is equal to \\( 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 \\) hours.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total jogging time for two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks there are \\( 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\) days. Since Mr. John jogs for 1.5 hours each day, the total jogging time for two weeks is \\( 1.5 \\times 14 \\) hours.\n\nNow, let's perform the multiplication:\n\\[ 1.5 \\times 14 = 1.5 \\times (10 + 4) = (1.5 \\times 10) + (1.5 \\times 4) = 15 + 6 = 21 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Mr. John will have spent jogging after two weeks is \\(\\boxed{21}\\) hours.",
        "To determine the total time Mr. John will have spent jogging after two weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Convert the daily jogging time into hours:**\n   Mr. John jogs for 1 hour 30 minutes each day. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can express this as:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ hour} + 0.5 \\text{ hour} = 1.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of days in two weeks:**\n   There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks there are:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 7 = 14 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the daily jogging time by the number of days:**\n   To find the total time spent jogging over two weeks, we multiply the daily jogging time by the number of days:\n   \\[\n   1.5 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 21 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Mr. John will have spent jogging after two weeks is \\(\\boxed{21}\\) hours.",
