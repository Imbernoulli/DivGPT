        "To determine how many chairs Gerald can make if he makes 24 tables, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of wood used to make 24 tables.\n2. Subtract the amount of wood used for the tables from the total amount of wood Gerald has.\n3. Determine how many chairs can be made with the remaining wood.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of wood used to make 24 tables. Since each table requires 12 pieces of wood, we multiply the number of tables by the amount of wood per table:\n\\[\n24 \\text{ tables} \\times 12 \\text{ pieces of wood per table} = 288 \\text{ pieces of wood}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount of wood used for the tables from the total amount of wood Gerald has:\n\\[\n672 \\text{ pieces of wood} - 288 \\text{ pieces of wood} = 384 \\text{ pieces of wood}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we determine how many chairs can be made with the remaining wood. Since each chair requires 8 pieces of wood, we divide the remaining amount of wood by the amount of wood per chair:\n\\[\n384 \\text{ pieces of wood} \\div 8 \\text{ pieces of wood per chair} = 48 \\text{ chairs}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of chairs Gerald can make is \\boxed{48}.",
