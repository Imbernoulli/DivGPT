        "To determine how many rotten apples in the orchard did not smell, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of rotten apples:**\n   - Given that 40 percent of the 200 apples were rotten, we can find the number of rotten apples by multiplying the total number of apples by 40 percent.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rotten apples} = 0.40 \\times 200 = 80\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of rotten apples that smelled:**\n   - Given that 70 percent of the rotten apples smelled, we can find the number of rotten apples that smelled by multiplying the number of rotten apples by 70 percent.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rotten apples that smelled} = 0.70 \\times 80 = 56\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of rotten apples that did not smell:**\n   - To find the number of rotten apples that did not smell, we subtract the number of rotten apples that smelled from the total number of rotten apples.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rotten apples that did not smell} = 80 - 56 = 24\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of rotten apples in the orchard that did not smell is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",

Since 40 percent of the 200 apples were rotten, we can find the number of rotten apples by multiplying 200 by 0.40:\n\n\\[\n200 \\times 0.40 = 80\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 80 rotten apples.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these rotten apples smelled. Since 70 percent of the rotten apples smelled, we multiply the number of rotten apples by 0.70:\n\n\\[\n80 \\times 0.70 = 56\n\\]\n\nSo, 56 rotten apples smelled.\n\nTo find the number of rotten apples that did not smell, we subtract the number of rotten apples that smelled from the total number of rotten apples:\n\n\\[\n80 - 56 = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of rotten apples in the orchard that did not smell is \\boxed{24}.",

Since 70 percent of the rotten apples smelled, we can find the number of rotten apples that smelled by multiplying 80 by 0.70:\n\\[\n80 \\times 0.70 = 56\n\\]\nSo, 56 rotten apples smelled.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of rotten apples that smelled from the total number of rotten apples to find the number of rotten apples that did not smell:\n\\[\n80 - 56 = 24\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of rotten apples in the orchard that did not smell is \\boxed{24}.",

Subtract the number of rotten apples that smelled from the total number of rotten apples to find the number of rotten apples that did not smell.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of rotten apples.\n   The orchard has 200 apples, and 40 percent of them are rotten.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rotten apples} = 200 \\times \\frac{40}{100} = 200 \\times 0.40 = 80\n   \\]\n   So, there are 80 rotten apples.\n\n2. Determine the number of rotten apples that smelled.\n   70 percent of the rotten apples smelled.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rotten apples that smelled} = 80 \\times \\frac{70}{100} = 80 \\times 0.70 = 56\n   \\]\n   So, 56 rotten apples smelled.\n\n3. Subtract the number of rotten apples that smelled from the total number of rotten apples to find the number of rotten apples that did not smell.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rotten apples that did not smell} = 80 - 56 = 24\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of rotten apples in the orchard that did not smell is \\boxed{24}.",
        "To determine how many rotten apples in the orchard did not smell, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of rotten apples:**\n   Given that 40 percent of the 200 apples were rotten, we can find the number of rotten apples by multiplying the total number of apples by 40 percent.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rotten apples} = 200 \\times 0.40 = 80\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of rotten apples that smelled:**\n   We know that 70 percent of the rotten apples smelled. Therefore, we can find the number of rotten apples that smelled by multiplying the number of rotten apples by 70 percent.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rotten apples that smelled} = 80 \\times 0.70 = 56\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of rotten apples that did not smell:**\n   To find the number of rotten apples that did not smell, we subtract the number of rotten apples that smelled from the total number of rotten apples.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rotten apples that did not smell} = 80 - 56 = 24\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of rotten apples in the orchard that did not smell is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
