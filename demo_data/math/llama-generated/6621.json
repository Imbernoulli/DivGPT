        "To determine how long Tony's drive will take the next day, we first need to calculate his driving speed. We know that he drove 120 miles in 3 hours.\n\nFirst, we calculate the speed:\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{120 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ hours}} = 40 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take him to drive 200 miles at this speed. We use the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{200 \\text{ miles}}{40 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the drive will take \\boxed{5} hours."
