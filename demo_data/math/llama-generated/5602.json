        "To determine the total number of hours Bethany rode over a 2-week period, we need to calculate the number of hours she rode each day and then sum these amounts for the two weeks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of hours Bethany rode in one week:\n- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, she rode for 1 hour each day. Therefore, for these three days, she rode:\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ hour/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n- On Tuesday and Thursday, she rode for 30 minutes each day. Since 30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours, for these two days, she rode:\n  \\[\n  0.5 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n  \\]\n- On Saturday, she rode for 2 hours. Therefore, for Saturday, she rode:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n- Adding these amounts together gives the total number of hours she rode in one week:\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours she rode in two weeks. Since she rides 6 hours each week, for two weeks, she rides:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 12 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Bethany rode over a 2-week period is \\boxed{12}.",
        "To determine the total number of hours Bethany rode horses over a 2-week period, we need to calculate her weekly riding time and then double it.\n\nFirst, let's calculate her riding time for one week:\n\n- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, she rides for 1 hour each day.\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ hour/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n\n- On Tuesday and Thursday, she rides for 30 minutes each day.
