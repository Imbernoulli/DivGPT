        "To determine how much Jimmy will earn if he sells all his action figures, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the value of each action figure and the discount he is offers.\n2. Calculate the selling price for each action figure.\n3. Sum up the selling prices of all the action figures.\n\nFirst, let's identify the value of each action figure and the discount:\n- Jimmy has 4 action figures worth $15 each.\n- Jimmy has 1 action figure worth $20.\n- Each action figure is sold for $5 less than its value.\n\nNext, we calculate the selling price for each type of action figure:\n- The selling price for each of the 4 action figures worth $15 is $15 - $5 = $10.\n- The selling price for the 1 action figure worth $20 is $20 - $5 = $15.\n\nNow, we sum up the selling prices of all the action figures:\n- The total selling price for the 4 action figures worth $10 each is $10 * 4 = $40.\n- The total selling price for the 1 action figure worth $15 is $15 * 1 = $15.\n- The total selling price for all the action figures is $40 + $15 = $55.\n\nTherefore, Jimmy will earn \\(\\boxed{55}\\) dollars if he sells all the figures.",

Determine the total earnings from selling all the figures.\n\nFirst, let's identify the value of each type of action figure:\n- Jimmy has 4 action figures worth $15 each.\n- Jimmy has 1 action figure worth $20.\n\nNext, calculate the reduced price for each type of action figure:\n- Each $15 action figure is sold for $5 less, so the reduced price is $15 - $5 = $10.\n- The $20 action figure is sold for $5 less, so the reduced price is $20 - $5 = $15.\n\nNow, determine the total earnings from selling all the figures:\n- Jimmy sells 4 action figures at $10 each, so the earnings from these figures are $10 * 4 = $40.\n- Jimmy sells 1 action figure at $15, so the earnings from this figure are $15 * 1 = $15.\n- The total earnings from selling all the figures is $40 + $15 = $55.\n\nTherefore, Jimmy will earn \\(\\boxed{55}\\) dollars if he sells all the figures.",
