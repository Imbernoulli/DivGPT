        "To determine how many students choose to attend Harvard University, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students accepted to Harvard University.\n2. Determine how many of the accepted students choose to attend Harvard University.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of students accepted to Harvard University.**\n\nThe total number of applicants is 20,000, and 5% of them are accepted. Therefore, the number of students accepted is:\n\\[ 20,000 \\times 0.05 = 1,000 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many of the accepted students choose to attend Harvard University.**\n\nOf the 1,000 accepted students, 90% choose to attend. Therefore, the number of students who choose to attend is:\n\\[ 1,000 \\times 0.90 = 900 \\]\n\nSo, the number of students who choose to attend Harvard University is \\(\\boxed{900}\\).",

Therefore, the number of students accepted is:\n\\[ 20,000 \\times 0.05 = 1,000 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of accepted students who choose to attend Harvard University.**\n\nOf the 1,000 accepted students, 90% choose to attend. Therefore, the number of students who choose to attend is:\n\\[ 1,000 \\times 0.90 = 900 \\]\n\nThus, the number of students who choose to attend Harvard University is \\(\\boxed{900}\\).",
