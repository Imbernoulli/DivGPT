When she was done, she had three times as many white eggs as brown eggs. On her way back to the house, she stumbled, dropping her egg basket. Upon inspecting the damage, she found that all 5 of the brown eggs survived, but now she only had a dozen eggs left. How many eggs did Linda break?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "Let's denote the number of brown eggs Linda initially had as \\( b \\) and the number of white eggs as \\( w \\). According to the problem, Linda had three times as many white eggs as brown eggs, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ w = 3b \\]\n\nAfter Linda dropped her egg basket, all 5 of the brown eggs survived, and she had a total of 12 eggs left. This means the number of brown eggs remaining is 5, and the number of white eggs remaining is \\( 12 - 5 = 7 \\).\n\nLet's denote the number of brown eggs broken as \\( x \\) and the number of white eggs broken as \\( y \\). Since all the brown eggs were initially \\( b \\) and only 5 survived, the number of brown eggs broken is:\n\\[ x = b - 5 \\]\n\nSimilarly, since all the white eggs were initially \\( w \\) and only 7 survived, the number of white eggs broken is:\n\\[ y = w - 7 \\]\n\nThe total number of eggs broken is the sum of the brown eggs broken and the white eggs broken:\n\\[ x + y = (b - 5) + (w - 7) = b + w - 12 \\]\n\nWe already know that \\( w = 3b \\), so we substitute \\( w \\) with \\( 3b \\) in the equation:\n\\[ x + y = b + 3b - 12 = 4b - 12 \\]\n\nSince Linda had a total of 12 eggs left after the drop, the total number of eggs she initially had is:\n\\[ b + w = b + 3b = 4b \\]\n\nThe number of eggs broken is the difference between the initial number of eggs and the number of eggs left:\n\\[ 4b - 12 \\]\n\nWe know this is equal to the total number of eggs broken, so the equation is already satisfied. Therefore, the number of eggs Linda broke is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",

The total number of eggs left after the drop is 12. Therefore, the number of white eggs remaining is:\n\n\\[ 12 - 5 = 7 \\]\n\nSince the number of white eggs remaining is 7, and initially Linda had \\( w = 3b \\) white eggs, the number of white eggs broken is:\n\n\\[ w - 7 = 3b - 7 \\]\n\nWe also know that the initial number of brown eggs \\( b \\) must be 5 (since all 5 brown eggs survived). Substituting \\( b = 5 \\) into the equation for the number of white eggs broken, we get:\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 5 - 7 = 15 - 7 = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the number of white eggs broken is 8. Since no brown eggs were broken, the total number of eggs broken is:\n\n\\[ 8 + (5 - 5) = 8 + 0 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs Linda broke is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",
        "Let's denote the number of brown eggs Linda initially had as \\( b \\). According to the problem, Linda had three times as many white eggs as brown eggs, so the number of white eggs she initially had is \\( 3b \\).\n\nThe total number of eggs Linda initially had is the sum of the brown eggs and the white eggs:\n\\[\nb + 3b = 4b\n\\]\n\nAfter dropping the egg basket, Linda found that all 5 of the brown eggs survived, but she only had a dozen (12) eggs left in total. This means that out of the white eggs, only \\( 12 - 5 = 7 \\) white eggs survived. Therefore, the number of white eggs she broke is:\n\\[\n3b - 7\n\\]\n\nThe total number of eggs Linda broke is the sum of the brown eggs she broke and the white eggs she broke. Since all 5 brown eggs survived, she did not break any brown eggs. So, the total number of eggs she broke is:\n\\[\n0 + (3b - 7) = 3b - 7\n\\]\n\nWe know that the total number of eggs Linda had before dropping the basket was \\( 4b \\), and after the drop, she had 12 eggs left. Therefore, the number of eggs she broke is:\n\\[\n4b - 12\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 4b - 12 = 3b - 7 \\), we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n4b - 12 = 3b - 7\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( b \\), we subtract \\( 3b \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nb - 12 = -7\n\\]\n\nNext, we add 12 to both sides:\n\\[\nb = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, Linda initially had 5 brown eggs. Since she had three times as many white eggs as brown eggs, she initially had:\n\\[\n3 \\times 5 = 15\n\\]\nwhite eggs.\n\nThe total number of eggs Linda initially had is:\n\\[\n5 + 15 = 20\n\\]\n\nAfter dropping the basket, she had 12 eggs left. Therefore, the number of eggs she broke is:\n\\[\n20 - 12 = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of eggs Linda broke is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",

Since she didn't break any brown eggs, the number of eggs she broke is just the number of white eggs she broke, which is \\( 3b - 7 \\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n4b - 12 = 3b - 7\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( b \\), we subtract \\( 3b \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nb - 12 = -7\n\\]\n\\[\nb = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, Linda initially had 5 brown eggs.

        "Let's start by defining the variables for the number of white eggs and brown eggs Linda initially had. Let \\( b \\) be the number of brown eggs.

This means that the number of white eggs that survived is:\n\\[\n12 - 5 = 7\n\\]\n\nSince the number of white eggs Linda initially had was \\( 3b \\), and she only 7 white eggs survived, the number of white eggs she broke is:\n\\[\n3b - 7\n\\]\n\nThe total number of eggs Linda initially had was \\( 4b \\), and after the drop, she had 12 eggs left. Therefore, the number of eggs she broke is:\n\\[\n4b - 12\n\\]\n\nSince the number of eggs she broke is the same in both calculations, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n3b - 7 = 4b - 12\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( b \\), we subtract \\( 3b \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n-7 = b - 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we add 12 to both sides:\n\\[\nb = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, Linda initially had 5 brown eggs.

        "Let's denote the number of brown eggs Linda initially had as \\( b \\). According to the problem, Linda had three times as many white eggs as brown eggs, so the number of white eggs she initially had is \\( 3b \\). Therefore, the total number of eggs she initially had is:\n\\[\nb + 3b = 4b\n\\]\n\nAfter dropping her egg basket, all 5 brown eggs survived, so the number of brown eggs she has left is 5. The total number of eggs she has left after the drop is 12. Since all the brown eggs survived, the number of white eggs she has left is \\( 12 - 5 = 7 \\). This means that she broke \\( 3b - 7 \\) white eggs.\n\nThe total number of eggs she initially had is \\( 4b \\), and the number of eggs she has left is 12, so the number of eggs she broke is:\n\\[\n4b - 12\n\\]\n\nSince the number of white eggs she broke is \\( 3b - 7 \\) and the total number of eggs she broke is \\( 4b - 12 \\), we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n3b - 7 = 4b - 12\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( b \\), we solve the equation by isolating \\( b \\):\n\\[\n3b - 4b = -12 + 7\n\\]\n\\[\n-b = -5\n\\]\n\\[\nb = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, Linda initially had 5 brown eggs. Therefore, the number of white eggs she initially had is:\n\\[\n3b = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n\\]\n\nThe total number of eggs she initially had is:\n\\[\nb + 3b = 5 + 15 = 20\n\\]\n\nSince she has 12 eggs left after the drop, the number of eggs she broke is:\n\\[\n20 - 12 = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of eggs Linda broke is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many eggs Linda broke, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the initial number of brown eggs:**\n   - Linda found that all 5 brown eggs survived.\n   - Let \\( b \\) represent the initial number of brown eggs.\n   - Therefore, \\( b = 5 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the initial number of white eggs:**\n   - Linda had three times as many white eggs as brown eggs.\n   - Let \\( w \\) represent the initial number of white eggs.\n   - Therefore, \\( w = 3b \\).\n   - Substituting \\( b = 5 \\) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     w = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total initial number of eggs:**\n   - The total initial number of eggs is the sum of the brown eggs and the white eggs.\n   - Therefore, the total initial number of eggs is:\n     \\[\n     b + w = 5 + 15 = 20\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of eggs left after the drop:**\n   - Linda found that she only had a dozen eggs left.\n   - Therefore, the number of eggs left is 12.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of eggs broken:**\n   - The number of eggs broken is the difference between the total initial number of eggs and the number of eggs left.\n   - Therefore, the number of eggs broken is:\n     \\[\n     20 - 12 = 8\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of eggs Linda broke is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
        "To determine how many eggs Linda broke, we start by defining the variables for the number of brown and white eggs she initially had. Let \\( b \\) represent the number of brown eggs and \\( w \\) represent the number of white eggs. According to the problem, Linda had three times as many white eggs as brown eggs, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ w = 3b \\]\n\nNext, we know that Linda dropped her egg basket and all 5 of the brown eggs survived. This means that the number of brown eggs she had initially is 5:\n\\[ b = 5 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( b = 5 \\) into the equation \\( w = 3b \\), we find the number of white eggs:\n\\[ w = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs Linda had initially is the sum of the brown and white eggs:\n\\[ b + w = 5 + 15 = 20 \\]\n\nAfter the drop, Linda only had a dozen eggs left, which means she broke:\n\\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \\]\n\nThus, the number of eggs Linda broke is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
        "Let \\( w \\) represent the number of white eggs and \\( b \\) represent the number of brown eggs Linda initially gathered. According to the problem, Linda had three times as many white eggs as brown eggs. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\nw = 3b\n\\]\n\nWe are also given that all 5 brown eggs survived the fall, so \\( b = 5 \\). Substituting \\( b = 5 \\) into the equation \\( w = 3b \\), we get:\n\\[\nw = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, Linda initially had 15 white eggs and 5 brown eggs. The total number of eggs she initially had is:\n\\[\nw + b = 15 + 5 = 20\n\\]\n\nAfter the fall, Linda only had a dozen eggs left. Therefore, the number of eggs she broke is:\n\\[\n20 - 12 = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of eggs Linda broke is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

Therefore, the number of white eggs she broke is:\n\n\\[ 3b - 7 \\]\n\nThe total number of eggs she broke is the sum of the brown eggs she broke and the white eggs she broke. Since she didn't break any brown eggs, the number of brown eggs she broke is 0. Thus, the total number of eggs she broke is:\n\n\\[ 0 + (3b - 7) = 3b - 7 \\]\n\nWe also know that the total number of eggs she broke plus the number of eggs she survived equals the initial number of eggs. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 3b - 7 + 12 = 4b \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 3b + 5 = 4b \\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 3b \\) from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ 5 = b \\]\n\nSo, Linda initially had \\( b = 5 \\) brown eggs.

        "To determine how many eggs Linda broke, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of brown eggs before the drop:**\n   Linda found that all 5 brown eggs survived the drop. Therefore, the number of brown eggs before the drop was 5.\n\n2. **Determine the number of white eggs before the drop:**\n   Linda had three times as many white eggs as brown eggs. Let \\( W \\) represent the number of white eggs. According to the problem:\n   \\[\n   W = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of eggs before the drop:**\n   The total number of eggs before the drop is the sum of the brown eggs and the white eggs:\n   \\[\n   5 + 15 = 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of eggs left after the drop:**\n   Linda found that she had a dozen eggs left after the drop. Therefore, the number of eggs left is 12.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of eggs broken:**\n   The number of eggs broken is the difference between the total number of eggs before the drop and the number of eggs left:\n   \\[\n   20 - 12 = 8\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of eggs Linda broke is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

According to the problem, she had three times as many white eggs as brown eggs, so the number of white eggs is \\( 3b \\).\n\nThe total number of eggs Linda originally had is the sum of the brown eggs and the white eggs:\n\\[\nb + 3b = 4b\n\\]\n\nAfter dropping her egg basket, she found that all 5 of the brown eggs survived, but she only had a dozen eggs left in total. This means that she still has 5 brown eggs and some number of white eggs that add up to 12. Let's denote the number of white eggs she still has as \\( w \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n5 + w = 12\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( w \\), we get:\n\\[\nw = 12 - 5 = 7\n\\]\n\nSo, Linda still has 7 white eggs. Since she originally had \\( 3b \\) white eggs, the number of white eggs she broke is:\n\\[\n3b - 7\n\\]\n\nWe also know that the total number of eggs she originally had was \\( 4b \\), and after the drop, she has 12 eggs left. Therefore, the number of eggs she broke is:\n\\[\n4b - 12\n\\]\n\nSince both expressions represent the number of eggs she broke, we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n3b - 7 = 4b - 12\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( b \\), we get:\n\\[\n12 - 7 = 4b - 3b\n\\]\n\\[\n5 = b\n\\]\n\nSo, Linda originally had 5 brown eggs.

Since the total number of eggs Linda originally had was \\( 4b \\), and she now has 12 eggs left, the number of eggs broken is \\( 4b - 12 \\).\n\nSince the number of white eggs broken is \\( 3b - 7 \\) and this must equal the total number of eggs broken \\( 4b - 12 \\), we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 3b - 7 = 4b - 12 \\]\nSolving for \\( b \\), we subtract \\( 3b \\) from both sides:\n\\[ -7 = b - 12 \\]\nAdding 12 to both sides:\n\\[ b = 5 \\]\n\nSo, Linda originally had \\( 4b = 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\) eggs.

Since no brown eggs were broken, the total number of eggs broken is:\n\n\\[ 0 + 8 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of eggs Linda broke is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",
        "To determine how many eggs Linda broke, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. Let \\( b \\) represent the number of brown eggs Linda initially had.\n2. Since Linda had three times as many white eggs as brown eggs, the number of white eggs she initially had is \\( 3b \\).\n3. The total number of eggs Linda initially had is the sum of the brown eggs and the white eggs, which is \\( b + 3b = 4b \\).\n4. After dropping the basket, Linda found that all 5 brown eggs survived, and she had a total of 12 eggs left. Therefore, the number of white eggs she had left after the drop is \\( 12 - 5 = 7 \\).\n5. Since she originally had \\( 3b \\) white eggs and now has 7 white eggs left, the number of white eggs she broke is \\( 3b - 7 \\).\n6. The total number of eggs she broke is the sum of the brown eggs she broke and the white eggs she broke. She broke \\( 3b - 3 \\) brown eggs (since she originally had \\( b \\) brown eggs and now has 5 left), and \\( 3b - 7 \\) white eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs she broke is \\( (b - 5) + (3b - 7) = 4b - 12 \\).\n7. We know that the total number of eggs she initially had is \\( 4b \\), and after the drop, she had 12 eggs left. Therefore, the number of eggs she broke is \\( 4b - 12 \\).\n8.
