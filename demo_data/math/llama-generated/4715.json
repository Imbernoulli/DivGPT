        "To determine how many rats Bill bought, let's define the number of chihuahuas he bought as \\( c \\) and the number of rats he bought as \\( r \\). According to the problem, the total number of animals Bill bought is 70, and the number of rats is 6 times the number of chihuahuas. We can express this information with the following equations:\n\n\\[ c + r = 70 \\]\n\\[ r = 6c \\]\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ c + 6c = 70 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ 7c = 70 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( c \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:\n\n\\[ c = 10 \\]\n\nNow that we know Bill bought 10 chihuahuas, we can find the number of rats by substituting \\( c = 10 \\) back into the second equation:\n\n\\[ r = 6 \\times 10 = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of rats Bill bought is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
        "Let's define the number of chihuahuas Bill bought as \\( C \\).
