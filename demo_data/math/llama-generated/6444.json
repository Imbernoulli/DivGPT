        "To determine the total number of people who bought tickets, we start by defining variables for the number of adults and children. Let \\( a \\) represent the number of adults. According to the problem, there are three times as many children as adults, so the number of children is \\( 3a \\).\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue from adult tickets and child tickets separately. The cost of an adult ticket is $7, so the total revenue from adult tickets is:\n\\[ 7a \\]\n\nThe cost of a child's ticket is $3, so the total revenue from child tickets is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 3a = 9a \\]\n\nThe total revenue collected from both adult and child tickets is given as $6,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 7a + 9a = 6000 \\]\n\nCombining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 16a = 6000 \\]\n\nTo find the number of adults, we solve for \\( a \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 16:\n\\[ a = \\frac{6000}{16} = 375 \\]\n\nNow that we know there are 375 adults, we can find the number of children by multiplying the number of adults by 3:\n\\[ 3a = 3 \\times 375 = 1125 \\]\n\nThe total number of people who bought tickets is the sum of the number of adults and the number of children:\n\\[ 375 + 1125 = 1500 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of people who bought tickets is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1500} \\]",
