        "To determine the number of junior girls on Ben's hockey team, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of boys on the team:**\n   The team is 60% boys. Since the total number of players is 50, we can find the number of boys by multiplying 50 by 60% (or 0.60).\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of boys} = 50 \\times 0.60 = 30\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of girls on the team:**\n   The rest of the team are girls. Since there are 50 players in total and 30 of them are boys, the number of girls is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls} = 50 - 30 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of junior girls:**\n   Half of the girls are juniors and the other half are seniors. Therefore, the number of junior girls is half of the total number of girls.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of junior girls} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of junior girls on the team is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
