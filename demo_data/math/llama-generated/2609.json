        "To determine the number of blue, spotted fish in the tank, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of blue fish.\n2. Determine how many of the blue fish have spots.\n\nFirst, we know there are 30 fish in the tank and one third of them are blue. Therefore, the number of blue fish is:\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{3} = 10\n\\]\nNext, we know that half of the blue fish have spots. Therefore, the number of blue, spotted fish is:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{2} = 5\n\\]\nSo, the number of blue, spotted fish in the tank is \\boxed{5}.",
