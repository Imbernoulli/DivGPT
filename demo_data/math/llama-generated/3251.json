        "To determine the total distance Alice walks in a week, we need to calculate the distance she walks each day and then sum these distances over the five days of the week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Alice walks each day. From Monday to Friday morning, she walks 10 miles to school. Therefore, the distance she walks to school each day is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance Alice walks each day on her way home. From Monday to Friday afternoon, she walks 12 miles through a forest.
