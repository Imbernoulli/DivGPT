John has to pay $5000 in rent and $3000 in non-rent extra expenses each month. Therefore, the total expenses are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total expenses} = 48000 + 5000 + 3000 = 56000\n   \\]\n\n5. The profit is the total revenue minus the total expenses:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 67200 - 56000 = 11200\n   \\]\n\nSo, John's monthly profit is \\(\\boxed{11200}\\).",
