        "To determine how many seats are still available in the auditorium, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of seats currently taken.\n2. Calculate the number of broken seats.\n3. Subtract the number of seats taken and the number of broken seats from the total number of seats to find the number of seats still available.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of seats currently taken. The auditorium holds 500 people, and two-fifths of the seats are taken:\n\\[\n\\text{Seats taken} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 500 = 200\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of broken seats. One-tenth of the seats are broken:\n\\[\n\\text{Broken seats} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 500 = 50\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of seats taken and the number of broken seats from the total number of seats to find the number of seats still available:\n\\[\n\\text{Seats available} = 500 - \\text{Seats taken} - \\text{Broken seats} = 500 - 200 - 50 = 250\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of seats still available is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{250}\n\\]",

Calculate the number of broken seats.\n3. Subtract the number of taken seats and broken seats from the total number of seats to find the number of available seats.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of seats that are currently taken. The auditorium holds 500 people, and two-fifths of the seats are taken:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of seats taken} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 500 = \\frac{2 \\times 500}{5} = \\frac{1000}{5} = 200\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of broken seats. One-tenth of the seats are broken:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of broken seats} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 500 = \\frac{500}{10} = 50\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of taken seats and broken seats from the total number of seats to find the number of available seats:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of available seats} = 500 - 200 - 50 = 250\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of seats still available is \\boxed{250}.",

Subtract the number of seats taken and the number of broken seats from the total number of seats.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of seats currently taken. The auditorium holds 500 people, and two-fifths of the seats are taken:\n\\[\n\\text{Seats taken} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 500 = 200\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of broken seats. One-tenth of the seats are broken:\n\\[\n\\text{Broken seats} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 500 = 50\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of seats taken and the number of broken seats from the total number of seats to find out how many seats are still available:\n\\[\n\\text{Seats available} = 500 - 200 - 50 = 250\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of seats still available is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",
