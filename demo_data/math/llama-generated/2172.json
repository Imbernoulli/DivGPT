        "To determine how many times greater the area Tommy's friend can ride in compared to Tommy, we need to calculate the area each can ride in and then find the ratio of the two areas.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area Tommy can ride in. Tommy's mother lets him ride his bike 2 blocks north, 3 blocks east, 2 blocks west, and 2 blocks south. This means that the maximum distance Tommy can travel north from his starting point is 2 blocks, and the maximum distance he can travel south from his starting point is also 2 blocks. Therefore, the total distance he can travel north to south is:\n\\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \\text{ blocks} \\]\n\nSimilarly, the maximum distance Tommy can travel east from his starting point is 3 blocks, and the maximum distance he can travel west from his starting point is 2 blocks. Therefore, the total distance he can travel east to west is:\n\\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \\text{ blocks} \\]\n\nThe area Tommy can ride in is a rectangle with a length of 5 blocks and a width of 4 blocks. The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[ A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\]\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[ A_{\\text{Tommy}} = 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ square blocks} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Tommy's friend's father lets his friend ride his bike in an area of 80 square blocks. Therefore, the area \\( A_{\\text{friend}} \\) is:\n\\[ A_{\\text{friend}} = 80 \\text{ square blocks} \\]\n\nTo find out how many times greater the area Tommy's friend can ride in compared to Tommy, we divide the area Tommy's friend can ride in by the area Tommy can ride in:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{A_{\\text{friend}}}{A_{\\text{Tommy}}} = \\frac{80}{20} = 4 \\]\n\nThus, the area Tommy's friend can ride in is \\(\\boxed{4}\\) times greater than the area Tommy can ride in.",

        "To determine how many times greater the area his friend can ride in compared to Tommy, we need to calculate the area each of them can ride in and then find the ratio of the two areas.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area Tommy can ride in. Tommy's mother lets him ride his bike 2 blocks north, 3 blocks east, 2 blocks west, and 2 blocks south. This means Tommy can ride in a rectangular area with a width of \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) blocks and a height of \\(2 + 2 = 4\\) blocks.
