        "To determine the total weight of the remaining coconut macaroons after John's little brother Steve eats the contents of one brown bag, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of all the coconut macaroons John baked.\n2. Determine the weight of the coconut macaroons in one brown bag.\n3. Subtract the weight of the coconut macaroons in one brown bag from the total weight to find the weight of the remaining coconut macaroons.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total weight of all the coconut macaroons. John baked 12 coconut macaroons, and each macaroon weighs 5 ounces. Therefore, the total weight is:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ macaroons} \\times 5 \\text{ ounces per macaroon} = 60 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the weight of the coconut macaroons in one brown bag. John packed an equal number of macaroons into 4 different brown bags. Since there are 12 macaroons in total, the number of macaroons in each brown bag is:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ macaroons} \\div 4 \\text{ bags} = 3 \\text{ macaroons per bag}\n\\]\nSince each macaroon weighs 5 ounces, the weight of the coconut macaroons in one brown bag is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ macaroons} \\times 5 \\text{ ounces per macaroon} = 15 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the weight of the coconut macaroons in one brown bag from the total weight to find the weight of the remaining coconut macaroons:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ ounces} - 15 \\text{ ounces} = 45 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total weight of the remaining coconut macaroons is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{45}\n\\]",

John baked 12 coconut macaroons, and each macaroon weighs 5 ounces.\n\\[\n12 \\text{ macaroons} \\times 5 \\text{ ounces per macaroon} = 60 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the weight of the coconut macaroons in each brown bag. John packed an equal number of macaroons in 4 different brown bags. Since he baked 12 macaroons, each brown bag contains:\n\\[\n\\frac{12 \\text{ macaroons}}{4 \\text{ bags}} = 3 \\text{ macaroons per bag}\n\\]\nEach macaroon weighs 5 ounces, so the weight of the macaroons in each brown bag is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ macaroons} \\times 5 \\text{ ounces per macaroon} = 15 \\text{ ounces per bag}\n\\]\n\nSteve eats the entire contents of one of the brown bags, so the weight of the coconut macaroons Steve ate is:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the weight of the coconut macaroons Steve ate from the total weight of all the coconut macaroons to find the total weight of the remaining coconut macaroons:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ ounces} - 15 \\text{ ounces} = 45 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the remaining coconut macaroons is \\boxed{45}.",
