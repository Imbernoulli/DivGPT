        "To determine how old Lydia will be when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the age of the tree when Lydia planted it:**\n   Lydia planted the tree when she was 4 years old.\n\n2. **Calculate the current age of the tree:**\n   Lydia is currently 9 years old. Therefore, the tree has been growing for:\n   \\[\n   9 - 4 = 5 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many more years it will take for the tree to bear fruit:**\n   It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit.
