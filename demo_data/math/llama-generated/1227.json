Determine how many photos Lisa took by subtracting 15 from Leslie's total.\n\nFirst, we know Leslie took 10 photos of animals. Since she took 3 times as many photos of flowers as animals, we calculate the number of photos of flowers as follows:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\]\nSo, Leslie took 30 photos of flowers.\n\nNext, we know Leslie took 10 fewer photos of scenery than the flowers. Therefore, the number of photos of scenery is:\n\\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \\]\nSo, Leslie took 20 photos of scenery.\n\nNow, we add up all the photos Leslie took:\n\\[ 10 + 30 + 20 = 60 \\]\nSo, Leslie took a total of 60 photos.\n\nSince Lisa took 15 fewer photos than Leslie, we subtract 15 from Leslie's total to find the number of photos Lisa took:\n\\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \\]\nSo, Lisa took \\(\\boxed{45}\\) photos last weekend.",

Determine how many photos Lisa took by subtracting 15 from Leslie's total.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of photos Leslie took of flowers. Leslie took 3 times as many photos of flowers as animals. Since she took 10 photos of animals, we have:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\]\nSo, Leslie took 30 photos of flowers.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of photos Leslie took of scenery. Leslie took 10 fewer photos of scenery than the flowers. Since she took 30 photos of flowers, we have:\n\\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \\]\nSo, Leslie took 20 photos of scenery.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of photos Leslie took. We add the photos of animals, flowers, and scenery:\n\\[ 10 + 30 + 20 = 60 \\]\nSo, Leslie took a total of 60 photos.\n\nFinally, let's determine how many photos Lisa took. Lisa took 15 fewer photos than Leslie. Since Leslie took 60 photos, we have:\n\\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \\]\nSo, Lisa took \\(\\boxed{45}\\) photos last weekend.",
