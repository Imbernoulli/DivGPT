        "To determine how many minutes on average faster this year's winner ran one mile of the race compared to last year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance each runner covered.\n2. Determine the time it took each runner to cover one mile.\n3. Find the difference in the time it took each runner to cover one mile.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total distance each runner covered.**\n\nThe town square is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of a mile long, and each runner ran around it 7 times.\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance} = 7 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{21}{4} = 5.25 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the time it took each runner to cover one mile.**\n\nThis year's winner finished the race in 42 minutes. To find the time it took to run one mile, we divide the total time by the total distance:\n\\[\n\\text{Time per mile for this year's winner} = \\frac{42}{5.25} = 8 \\text{ minutes per mile}\n\\]\n\nLast year's winner finished the race in 47.25 minutes. To find the time it took to run one mile, we divide the total time by the total distance:\n\\[\n\\text{Time per mile for last year's winner} = \\frac{47.25}{5.25} = 9 \\text{ minutes per mile}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference in the time it took each runner to cover one mile.**\n\nTo find out how many minutes faster this year's winner ran one mile compared to last year, we subtract the time it took this year's winner from the time it took last year's winner:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 9 - 8 = 1 \\text{ minute}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, this year's winner ran one mile on average \\(\\boxed{1}\\) minute faster than last year.",

Therefore, the total distance is:\n\\[\n7 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{21}{4} = 5.25 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the average time per mile for this year's winner. This year's winner finished the race in 42 minutes. So, the average time per mile is:\n\\[\n\\frac{42}{5.25} = 8 \\text{ minutes per mile}\n\\]\n\nThen, we determine the average time per mile for last year's winner. Last year's winner finished the race in 47.25 minutes. So, the average time per mile is:\n\\[\n\\frac{47.25}{5.25} = 9 \\text{ minutes per mile}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference in the average time per mile between this year's winner and last year's winner:\n\\[\n9 - 8 = 1 \\text{ minute}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, this year's winner ran on average \\(\\boxed{1}\\) minute faster per mile compared to last year.",
