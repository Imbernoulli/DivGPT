        "To determine how much Leila spent altogether, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of fixing the automobile.\n2. Set up an equation to find out how much she spent at the supermarket.\n3. Calculate the total amount spent.\n\nFirst, we know that the cost of fixing the automobile is $350. According to the problem, this cost is $50 more than three times the amount she spent at the supermarket. Let's denote the amount she spent at the supermarket by \\( x \\).\n\nThe relationship between the cost of fixing the automobile and the amount spent at the supermarket can be expressed by the equation:\n\\[ 350 = 3x + 50 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 50 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 350 - 50 = 3x \\]\n\\[ 300 = 3x \\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ x = \\frac{300}{3} \\]\n\\[ x = 100 \\]\n\nSo, Leila spent $100 at the supermarket. Now, we need to find out how much she spent altogether. This is the sum of the amount she spent at the supermarket and the amount she spent fixing her automobile:\n\\[ 100 + 350 = 450 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Leila has spent altogether is \\(\\boxed{450}\\).",
        "To determine the total amount Leila spent, we need to find out how much she spent at the supermarket and then add it to the cost of fixing her automobile.\n\nLet's denote the amount Leila spent at the supermarket as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the cost of fixing her automobile is $350, which is $50 more than three times the amount she spent at the supermarket. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n\n\\[\n350 = 3x + 50\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 50 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n350 - 50 = 3x\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n300 = 3x\n\\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{300}{3} = 100\n\\]\n\nSo, Leila spent $100 at the supermarket.

We do this by subtracting 50 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n350 - 50 = 3S\n\\]\n\\[\n300 = 3S\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( S \\) by dividing both sides by 3:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{300}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nS = 100\n\\]\n\nSo, Leila spent $100 at the supermarket.\n\nNow, we add the amount she spent at the supermarket to the amount she spent fixing her automobile to find the total amount spent:\n\\[\nS + 350 = 100 + 350\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount spent} = 450\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Leila has spent altogether is \\(\\boxed{450}\\).",
