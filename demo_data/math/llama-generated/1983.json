Lazlo has 6 ounces less than 4 pounds of fudge. First, we convert 4 pounds to ounces:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ pounds} = 4 \\times 16 = 64 \\text{ ounces} \\]\nThen, we subtract 6 ounces from 64 ounces to find out how many ounces Lazlo has:\n\\[ 64 \\text{ ounces} - 6 \\text{ ounces} = 58 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the amounts of fudge Marina and Lazlo have:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ ounces} - 58 \\text{ ounces} = 14 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nTherefore, Marina has \\(\\boxed{14}\\) more ounces of fudge than Lazlo.",
        "To determine how many more ounces of fudge Marina had than Lazlo, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert Marina's fudge from pounds to ounces.\n2.
