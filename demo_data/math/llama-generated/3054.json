        "To determine the total number of calories John consumes in a day, we need to calculate the calories for each meal and the shakes, and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Breakfast:**\n   John eats breakfast, which is 500 calories.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Calories from breakfast} = 500\n   \\]\n\n2. **Lunch:**\n   Lunch contains 25% more calories than breakfast. First, we calculate 25% of 500 calories.\n   \\[\n   25\\% \\text{ of } 500 = 0.25 \\times 500 = 125\n   \\]\n   Adding this to the calories from breakfast gives us the total calories for lunch.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Calories from lunch} = 500 + 125 = 625\n   \\]\n\n3. **Dinner:**\n   Dinner is twice as many calories as lunch. First, we calculate twice the calories from lunch.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 625 = 1250\n   \\]\n   So, the total calories from dinner is 1250.\n\n4. **Shakes:**\n   John has 3 shakes, each containing 300 calories. First, we calculate the total calories from the shakes.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 300 = 900\n   \\]\n   So, the total calories from the shakes is 900.\n\n5. **Total calories in a day:**\n   Now, we sum up the calories from breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the shakes.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total calories} = 500 + 625 + 1250 + 900 = 3275\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of calories John gets in a day is \\boxed{3275}.",

Since dinner is twice as many calories as lunch, we can find the calories in dinner by multiplying the calories in lunch by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Calories in dinner} = 625 \\times 2 = 1250 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the calories for all three meals:\n\\[\n\\text{Calories for breakfast, lunch, and dinner} = 500 + 625 + 1250 = 2375 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total calories from the shakes. Since John has 3 shakes and each shake is 300 calories, we can find the total calories from the shakes by multiplying the number of shakes by the calories per shake:\n\\[\n\\text{Calories from shakes} = 3 \\times 300 = 900 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the calories from the meals and the shakes to get the total calories John consumes in a day:\n\\[\n\\text{Total calories} = 2375 + 900 = 3275 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of calories John gets in a day is \\boxed{3275}.",
