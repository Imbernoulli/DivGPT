        "To determine how old Trevor will be when his older brother is three times as old as Trevor is now, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the current age of Trevor's older brother.\n2. Calculate three times Trevor's current age.\n3. Set up an equation to find out how many years it will take for Trevor's older brother to be three times Trevor's current age.\n4. Solve the equation to find Trevor's age at that time.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- Trevor is currently 11 years old.\n- Trevor's older brother is currently 20 years old.\n\nFirst, calculate three times Trevor's current age:\n\\[ 3 \\times 11 = 33 \\]\n\nNext, let's denote the number of years from now when Trevor's older brother will be 33 years old as \\( x \\). In \\( x \\) years, Trevor will be \\( 11 + x \\) years old, and his older brother will be \\( 20 + x \\) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Trevor's older brother will be 33 years old, so we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 20 + x = 33 \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 33 - 20 \\]\n\\[ x = 13 \\]\n\nThis means that in 13 years, Trevor's older brother will be 33 years old. To find out how old Trevor will be at that time, we add 13 years to his current age:\n\\[ 11 + 13 = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, Trevor will be \\(\\boxed{24}\\) years old when his older brother is three times as old as Trevor is now.",
        "To determine how old Trevor will be when his older brother is three times as old as Trevor is now, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.

Three times 11 is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[3 \\times 11 = 33\\]\n\nSo, we need to find out how many years from now Trevor's older brother will be 33 years old.
