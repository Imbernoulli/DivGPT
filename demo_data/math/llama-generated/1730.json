        "To determine how many dollars Tom spends on the bricks, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of bricks Tom buys at a discount.\n2. Calculate the number of bricks Tom buys at full price.\n3. Determine the cost of the discounted bricks.\n4. Determine the cost of the full-price bricks.\n5. Add the costs of the discounted and full-price bricks to find the total cost.\n\nLet's start with step 1. Tom needs a total of 1000 bricks, and he buys half of them at a discount. Therefore, the number of bricks he buys at a discount is:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \\]\n\nNext, step 2. Since he buys half of the bricks at full price, the number of bricks he buys at full price is also:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \\]\n\nNow, step 3. The discount is 50% off of $0.50. So, the price per discounted brick is:\n\\[ 0.50 \\times (1 - 0.50) = 0.50 \\times 0.50 = 0.25 \\]\nThe total cost for the discounted bricks is:\n\\[ 500 \\times 0.25 = 125 \\]\n\nFor step 4, the price per full-price brick is $0.50. So, the total cost for the full-price bricks is:\n\\[ 500 \\times 0.50 = 250 \\]\n\nFinally, step 5. The total cost Tom spends is the sum of the cost of the discounted bricks and the cost of the full-price bricks:\n\\[ 125 + 250 = 375 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Tom spends is:\n\\[ \\boxed{375} \\]",

Calculate the number of bricks Tom buys at full price.\n3. Determine the cost of the discounted bricks.\n4. Determine the cost of the full-price bricks.\n5. Add the costs of the discounted bricks and the full-price bricks to find the total cost.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Tom needs 1000 bricks in total. Since he buys half at a discount and half at full price, we divide 1000 by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of discounted bricks} = \\frac{1000}{2} = 500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of full-price bricks} = \\frac{1000}{2} = 500\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we calculate the cost of the discounted bricks. The original price of each brick is $0.50, but with a 50% discount, the price per brick is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discounted price per brick} = 0.50 \\times 0.50 = 0.25\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total cost for the discounted bricks is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of discounted bricks} = 500 \\times 0.25 = 125\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we calculate the cost of the full-price bricks. The original price of each brick is $0.50, so the total cost for the full-price bricks is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of full-price bricks} = 500 \\times 0.50 = 250\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, we add the costs of the discounted bricks and the full-price bricks to find the total cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 125 + 250 = 375\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Tom spends is \\(\\boxed{375}\\).",

        "To determine how much Tom spends on bricks, we need to calculate the cost of the bricks he buys at a discount and the cost of the bricks he buys at full price.\n\nFirst, we find out how many bricks Tom buys at a discount. Since he needs 1000 bricks and half of them are discounted, we calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \\]\nSo, Tom buys 500 bricks at a discount.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of these 500 bricks. The discount is 50% off of $0.50, so the price per brick after the discount is:\n\\[ 0.50 \\times 0.50 = 0.25 \\]\nTherefore, the total cost for the 500 discounted bricks is:\n\\[ 500 \\times 0.25 = 125 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the cost of the other 500 bricks, which are bought at full price. The price per brick at full price is $0.50, so the total cost for the 500 full-price bricks is:\n\\[ 500 \\times 0.50 = 250 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the cost of the discounted bricks and the cost of the full-price bricks to find the total amount Tom spends:\n\\[ 125 + 250 = 375 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Tom spends is:\n\\[ \\boxed{375} \\]",

First, calculate the discount amount per brick.\n   \\[\n   0.50 \\times 0.50 = 0.25\n   \\]\n   So, each discounted brick costs $0.25. Now, calculate the total cost for 500 discounted bricks.\n   \\[\n   500 \\times 0.25 = 125\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost for the discounted bricks is $125.\n\n4. **Determine the cost of the full-price bricks:**\n   Each full-price brick costs $0.50. Now, calculate the total cost for 500 full-price bricks.\n   \\[\n   500 \\times 0.50 = 250\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost for the full-price bricks is $250.\n\n5. **Calculate the total amount spent:**\n   Add the total cost of the discounted bricks and the total cost of the full-price bricks.\n   \\[\n   125 + 250 = 375\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount Tom spends is \\(\\boxed{375}\\) dollars.",
