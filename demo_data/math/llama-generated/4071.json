        "To determine how many cookies Frank has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many cookies Mike has.\n2. Use the number of cookies Mike has to find out how many cookies Frank has.\n\nFirst, we know that Millie has 4 cookies. Since Mike has three times as many cookies as Millie, we can calculate the number of cookies Mike has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cookies Mike has} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of cookies Millie has} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Frank has three less than half the number of cookies as Mike. So, we need to find half the number of cookies Mike has and then subtract 3 from that number:\n\\[\n\\text{Half the number of cookies Mike has} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cookies Frank has} = 6 - 3 = 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies Frank has is \\boxed{3}.",
        "To determine how many cookies Frank has, we need to follow the information given step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Millie has 4 cookies.
