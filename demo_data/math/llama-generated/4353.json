        "To determine the total amount of money Jebb spent at the restaurant, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the service fee.\n2. Add the service fee to the original cost of the food.\n3. Add the tip to the total cost after the service fee.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the service fee. The service fee is 12% of the original cost of the food. The original cost of the food is $50.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Service fee} = 0.12 \\times 50 = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the service fee to the original cost of the food to find the total cost before the tip.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost before tip} = 50 + 6 = 56\n\\]\n\nThen, we add the tip to the total cost before the tip to find the total amount of money Jebb spent at the restaurant.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 56 + 5 = 61\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Jebb spent at the restaurant is \\boxed{61}.",
