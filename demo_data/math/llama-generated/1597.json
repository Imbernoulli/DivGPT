        "To determine Irene's age, we need to follow the information given step by step.\n\n1. First, we know Eddie's age is 92 years old.\n2. Becky is currently four times younger than Eddie. This means Becky's age is Eddie's age divided by 4.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Becky's age} = \\frac{92}{4} = 23\n   \\]\n3. Irene is two times Becky's age. Therefore, Irene's age is Becky's age multiplied by 2.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Irene's age} = 23 \\times 2 = 46\n   \\]\n\nThus, Irene is \\(\\boxed{46}\\) years old.",
