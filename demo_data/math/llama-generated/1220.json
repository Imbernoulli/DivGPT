        "To determine the total number of errors Genevieve has fixed so far, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of times Genevieve has debugged the program:**\n   Genevieve debugs the program every 100 lines of code. She has written 4300 lines of code.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of debugging sessions} = \\frac{4300 \\text{ lines}}{100 \\text{ lines/session}} = 43 \\text{ sessions}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of errors found in each debugging session:**\n   Each debugging session finds 3 errors.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of errors found and fixed:**\n   Since Genevieve fixes all the errors found in each session, we multiply the number of debugging sessions by the number of errors found per session.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of errors fixed} = 43 \\text{ sessions} \\times 3 \\text{ errors/session} = 129 \\text{ errors}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of errors Genevieve has fixed so far is \\(\\boxed{129}\\).",

Determine the total number of errors found and fixed based on the number of debuggings.\n\nFirst, we find out how many times Genevieve has debugged the program. She debugs the program every 100 lines of code. Since she has written 4300 lines of code, we divide 4300 by 100:\n\\[\n4300 \\div 100 = 43\n\\]\nSo, Genevieve has debugged the program 43 times.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of errors found and fixed. Since each debugging finds 3 errors, we multiply the number of debuggings by 3:\n\\[\n43 \\times 3 = 129\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of errors Genevieve has fixed so far is \\(\\boxed{129}\\).",
