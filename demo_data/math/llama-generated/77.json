        "To determine how many boxes of Graham crackers Lionel will have left over after making the maximum number of Oreo cheesecakes, we start by calculating how many cheesecakes he can make with the ingredients he bought.\n\nFirst, we calculate the maximum number of cheesecakes he can make based on the Graham crackers. Lionel has 14 boxes of Graham crackers, and each cheesecake requires 2 boxes. Therefore, the maximum number of cheesecakes he can make based on Graham crackers is:\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{14}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 7\n\\]\nNext, we calculate the maximum number of cheesecakes he can make based on the Oreos. Lionel has 15 packets of Oreos, and each cheesecake requires 3 packets. Therefore, the maximum number of cheesecakes he can make based on Oreos is:\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{15}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 5\n\\]\nSince the number of cheesecakes he can make is limited by the ingredient that runs out first, the maximum number of cheesecakes he can make is the smaller of the two values calculated above, which is 5.\n\nNow, we calculate how many boxes of Graham crackers Lionel will have left over after making 5 cheesecakes. Since each cheesecake requires 2 boxes of Graham crackers, the total number of boxes used for 5 cheesecakes is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 2 = 10\n\\]\nSubtracting the number of boxes used from the total number of boxes Lionel originally bought gives:\n\\[\n14 - 10 = 4\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of boxes of Graham crackers Lionel will have left over is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
