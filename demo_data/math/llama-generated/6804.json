This total time is the sum of the time it takes to bleach her hair and the time it takes to dye her hair. So, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   b + 2b = 9\n   \\]\n4. Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   3b = 9\n   \\]\n5. To find the value of \\( b \\), divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{9}{3} = 3\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Cordelia \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours to bleach her hair.",
        "To determine how many hours it will take Cordelia to bleach her hair, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's define the variables and relationships step by step.\n\n1. Let \\( b \\) represent the number of hours it takes to bleach her hair.\n2. According to the problem, dyeing takes twice as long as bleaching. Therefore, the time it takes to dye her hair is \\( 2b \\) hours.\n3. The total time for the entire process (bleaching and dyeing) is given as 9 hours.\n\nWe can now set up the following equation to represent the total time:\n\\[\nb + 2b = 9\n\\]\n\nCombine the terms on the left side:\n\\[\n3b = 9\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( b \\), divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[\nb = \\frac{9}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nb = 3\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take Cordelia \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours to bleach her hair."
