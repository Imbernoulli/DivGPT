        "To determine how much money Reggie has left after buying the books, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the books.\n2. Subtract the total cost of the books from the amount of money Reggie initially received.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the books. Reggie bought 5 books, and each book cost $2. So, we multiply the number of books by the cost per book:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ books} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/book} = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost of the books from the amount of money Reggie initially received. Reggie initially received $48. So, we subtract $10 from $48:\n\\[ 48 \\text{ dollars} - 10 \\text{ dollars} = 38 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Reggie has left is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",
