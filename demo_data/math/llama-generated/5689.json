        "To determine the weight of the sandbag, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the weight of the sand if the bag were filled with sand.\n2. Adjust the weight for the fact that the filling material is 40% heavier than sand.\n3. Determine the weight of the sandbag when it is 80% full.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the weight of the sand if the bag were filled with sand.**\n\nThe sandbag has a capacity of 250 pounds. If it were filled with sand, the weight would be:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Adjust the weight for the fact that the filling material is 40% heavier than sand.**\n\nSince the filling material is 40% heavier than sand, the weight of the filling material per pound of sand is:\n\\[ 1 + 0.40 = 1.40 \\text{ pounds per pound of sand} \\]\n\nTherefore, if the bag were filled with the filling material, the weight would be:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ pounds} \\times 1.40 = 350 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the weight of the sandbag when it is 80% full.**\n\nSince the bag is only 80% full, the weight of the filling material in the bag is:\n\\[ 350 \\text{ pounds} \\times 0.80 = 280 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThus, the weight of the sandbag is:\n\\[ \\boxed{280} \\]",
