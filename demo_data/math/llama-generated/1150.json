        "To determine the amount of money Betty will pay for 20 packs of nuts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find Betty's age.\n2. Determine the cost of one pack of nuts.\n3. Calculate the total cost for 20 packs of nuts.\n\nFirst, let's find Betty's age. We know that Doug is 40 years old and the sum of Doug's and Betty's ages is 90. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ \\text{Doug's age} + \\text{Betty's age} = 90 \\]\nSubstituting Doug's age into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 40 + \\text{Betty's age} = 90 \\]\nTo find Betty's age, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ \\text{Betty's age} = 90 - 40 = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the cost of one pack of nuts. We know that twice Betty's age is the cost of a pack of nuts. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of one pack of nuts} = 2 \\times \\text{Betty's age} \\]\nSubstituting Betty's age into the equation, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of one pack of nuts} = 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost for 20 packs of nuts.
