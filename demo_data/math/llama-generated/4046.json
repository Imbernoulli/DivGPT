        "To determine how much Tom sold his games for, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the new value of the games after they tripled in value.\n2. Determine the value of the games that Tom sold, which is 40% of the new value.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the new value of the games.**\n\nThe original value of the games was $200. Since the value tripled, we multiply the original value by 3:\n\\[ 200 \\times 3 = 600 \\]\nSo, the new value of the games is $600.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the value of the games that Tom sold.**\n\nTom sold 40% of the games. To find 40% of the new value, we multiply the new value by 0.40:\n\\[ 600 \\times 0.40 = 240 \\]\nSo, the value of the games that Tom sold is $240.\n\nTherefore, the amount Tom sold the games for is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",

        "To determine how much Tom sold his games for, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the new value of the games after they tripled in value.\n2. Determine the value of the games that Tom sold, which is 40% of the new value.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the new value of the games. The original value of the games was $200. Since the value tripled, we multiply $200 by 3:\n\\[\n200 \\times 3 = 600\n\\]\nSo, the new value of the games is $600.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much Tom sold 40% of the games for. To do this, we calculate 40% of $600. We can convert 40% to a decimal by dividing 40 by 100, which gives us 0.40. Then we multiply $600 by 0.40:\n\\[\n600 \\times 0.40 = 240\n\\]\nSo, Tom sold the games for \\(\\boxed{240}\\) dollars."
