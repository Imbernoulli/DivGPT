        "To determine how many stamps Tonya has left after the trade, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of matches Jimmy has:**\n   Each matchbook contains 24 matches, and Jimmy has 5 matchbooks.\n   \\[\n   24 \\text{ matches books} \\times 5 \\text{ matchbooks} = 120 \\text{ matches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert Jimmy's matches to stamps:**\n   We know that 12 matches are equivalent to 1 stamp.

Therefore, the number of stamps Jimmy receives is:\n\\[ \\frac{120}{12} = 10 \\text{ stamps} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of stamps Jimmy receives from the number of stamps Tonya initially has.**\n\nTonya initially has 13 stamps. After trading 10 stamps to Jimmy, the number of stamps Tonya has left is:\n\\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \\text{ stamps} \\]\n\nThus, the number of stamps Tonya has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]",
        "To determine how many stamps Tonya has left after the trade, we need to calculate the value of the matchbooks Jimmy trades in terms of stamps. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of matches Jimmy has in his 5 matchbooks.\n   Each matchbook contains 24 matches, so:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ matchbooks} \\times 24 \\text{ matches per matchbook} = 120 \\text{ matches}\n   \\]\n\n2. Convert the total number of matches into stamps. Since one stamp is worth 12 matches, we divide the total number of matches by 12:\n   \\[\n   120 \\text{ matches} \\div 12 \\text{ matches per stamp} = 10 \\text{ stamps}\n   \\]\n\n3. Jimmy trades all his matchbooks for stamps, so he gives Tonya 10 stamps. Tonya originally has 13 stamps, so after the trade, she has:\n   \\[\n   13 \\text{ stamps} - 10 \\text{ stamps} = 3 \\text{ stamps}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of stamps Tonya has left is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
