Determine the number of green cards by subtracting the number of red and black cards from the total number of cards.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of red cards.\n   The total number of cards is 120, and 2/5 of them are red.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red cards} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 120 = \\frac{2 \\times 120}{5} = \\frac{240}{5} = 48\n   \\]\n\n2.

        "To determine the number of green cards in the box, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of red cards.\n2. Calculate the number of black cards.\n3. Calculate the number of green cards.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of red cards.**\n\nThe total number of cards in the box is 120. Since 2/5 of the cards are red, we can find the number of red cards by multiplying 120 by 2/5:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red cards} = 120 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 120 \\times 0.4 = 48\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of black cards.**\n\nAfter removing the red cards, the remaining number of cards is:\n\\[\n120 - 48 = 72\n\\]\nSince 5/9 of the remaining cards are black, we can find the number of black cards by multiplying 72 by 5/9:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of black cards} = 72 \\times \\frac{5}{9} = 72 \\times \\frac{5}{9} = 8 \\times 5 = 40\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of green cards.**\n\nThe rest of the cards are green. Therefore, the number of green cards is the total number of cards minus the number of red cards and the number of black cards:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of green cards} = 120 - 48 - 40 = 32\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of green cards in the box is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{32}\n\\]",

Find the number of green cards by subtracting the number of red and black cards from the total number of cards.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of red cards. There are 120 cards in total, and 2/5 of them are red:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red cards} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 120 = \\frac{2 \\times 120}{5} = \\frac{240}{5} = 48\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the number of remaining cards after the red cards are removed:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining cards} = 120 - 48 = 72\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of black cards. Exactly 5/9 of the remaining cards are black:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of black cards} = \\frac{5}{9} \\times 72 = \\frac{5 \\times 72}{9} = \\frac{360}{9} = 40\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the number of green cards by subtracting the number of red and black cards from the total number of cards:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of green cards} = 120 - 48 - 40 = 32\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of green cards in the box is \\boxed{32}.",
