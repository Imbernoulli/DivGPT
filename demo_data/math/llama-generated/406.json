Start with the initial number of logs and apply the net change.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of logs burned in 3 hours:**\n   The cookfire burns 3 logs every hour. Therefore, in 3 hours, it will burn:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ logs/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 9 \\text{ logs}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of logs added to the cookfire in 3 hours:**\n   The cookfire gets 2 logs added to it at the end of every hour. Therefore, in 3 hours, it will get:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ logs/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ logs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the net change in the number of logs:**\n   The net change in the number of logs is the number of logs added minus the number of logs burned. So, the net change is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ logs} - 9 \\text{ logs} = -3 \\text{ logs}\n   \\]\n   This means that the number of logs decreases by 3 logs over the 3 hours.\n\n4. **Start with the initial number of logs and apply the net change:**\n   The initial number of logs is 6. After 3 hours, the number of logs will be:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ logs} + (-3 \\text{ logs}) = 6 \\text{ logs} - 3 \\text{ logs} = 3 \\text{ logs}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of logs left after 3 hours is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
