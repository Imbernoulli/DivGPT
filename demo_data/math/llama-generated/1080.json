Determine how many groups of three students can be formed from the total number of students.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of students in the class:\n\\[\n9 \\text{ boys} + 12 \\text{ girls} = 21 \\text{ students}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many groups of three students can be formed from these 21 students. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per group:\n\\[\n\\frac{21 \\text{ students}}{3 \\text{ students/group}} = 7 \\text{ groups}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of groups formed is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",
