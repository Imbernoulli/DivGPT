        "To determine the total time Harry will spend traveling, we need to break down the journey into its components: the bus ride and the walk.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total time Harry spends on the bus:\n- Harry has already been on the bus for 15 minutes.\n- The rest of the journey will take another 25 minutes.\n\nAdding these times together:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ minutes} + 25 \\text{ minutes} = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the time it takes Harry to walk from the bus stop to his house. The walk takes half the amount of time the bus journey took. Since the bus journey took 40 minutes, we calculate half of this time:\n\\[\n\\frac{40 \\text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the time spent on the bus to the time spent walking to find the total travel time:\n\\[\n40 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time Harry will have spent traveling is \\boxed{60} minutes."
