On a particular week, the number of students in the class on the second day was 40 more than the first day. The number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day. On the third day, 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick. If the total number of students in the class is 280, calculate the number of absent students in the three days.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "Let's denote the total number of students in the class as \\( T = 280 \\). Let the number of students present on the first day be \\( P_1 \\).

The number of students present on the third day is \\( P_3 \\).\n\nThe number of absent students on the second day is \\( T - (P_1 + 40) = 280 - P_1 - 40 = 240 - P_1 \\). The number of absent students on the third day is \\( T - P_3 = 280 - P_3 \\). According to the problem, the number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\\[ 240 - P_1 = 2(280 - P_3) \\]\n\\[ 240 - P_1 = 560 - 2P_3 \\]\n\\[ 2P_3 - P_1 = 320 \\]\n\\[ P_1 = 2P_3 - 320 \\]\n\nOn the third day, \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) of the total number of students called in sick, so the number of students present on the third day is:\n\\[ P_3 = 280 - \\frac{1}{7} \\times 280 = 280 - 40 = 240 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( P_3 = 240 \\) into the equation \\( P_1 = 2P_3 - 320 \\), we get:\n\\[ P_1 = 2 \\times 240 - 320 = 480 - 320 = 160 \\]\n\nThe number of absent students on the first day is:\n\\[ T - P_1 = 280 - 160 = 120 \\]\n\nThe number of absent students on the second day is:\n\\[ 240 - P_1 = 240 - 160 = 80 \\]\n\nThe number of absent students on the third day is:\n\\[ 280 - P_3 = 280 - 240 = 40 \\]\n\nThe total number of absent students in the three days is:\n\\[ 120 + 80 + 40 = 240 \\]\n\nThus, the number of absent students in the three days is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",

Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 240 - x = 2(280 - a) \\]\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 240 - x = 560 - 2a \\]\nRearranging terms to isolate \\( a \\), we get:\n\\[ 2a = 560 - 240 + x \\]\n\\[ 2a = 320 + x \\]\n\\[ a = 160 + \\frac{x}{2} \\]\n\nWe also know that on the third day, \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) of the total number of students called in sick. Therefore, the number of students who attended class on the third day is:\n\\[ a = 280 - \\frac{1}{7} \\times 280 = 280 - 40 = 240 \\]\n\nNow we substitute \\( a = 240 \\) into the equation \\( a = 160 + \\frac{x}{2} \\):\n\\[ 240 = 160 + \\frac{x}{2} \\]\nSubtracting 160 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ 80 = \\frac{x}{2} \\]\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\\[ x = 160 \\]\n\nSo, the number of students who attended class on the first day is 160. The number of students who attended class on the second day is:\n\\[ x + 40 = 160 + 40 = 200 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of absent students on each day:\n- On the first day, the number of absent students is:\n\\[ 280 - 160 = 120 \\]\n- On the second day, the number of absent students is:\n\\[ 280 - 200 = 80 \\]\n- On the third day, the number of absent students is:\n\\[ 280 - 240 = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of absent students in the three days is:\n\\[ 120 + 80 + 40 = 240 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]"
