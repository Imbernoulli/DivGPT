        "To determine how many questions Martin answered correctly, we start by finding out how many questions Kelsey answered correctly. According to the problem, Kelsey answered eight more questions correctly than Campbell. Since Campbell answered 35 questions correctly, we calculate Kelsey's correct answers as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Kelsey's correct answers} = \\text{Campbell's correct answers} + 8 = 35 + 8 = 43\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many questions Martin answered correctly. The problem states that Martin answered three fewer questions correctly than Kelsey. Since Kelsey answered 43 questions correctly, we calculate Martin's correct answers as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Martin's correct answers} = \\text{Kelsey's correct answers} - 3 = 43 - 3 = 40\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of questions Martin answered correctly is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",

        "To determine how many questions Martin answered correctly, we need to follow the relationships between the number of questions answered correctly by Martin, Kelsey, and Campbell step by step.\n\n1. **Determine how many questions Kelsey answered correctly:**\n   - Campbell answered 35 questions correctly.\n   - Kelsey answered eight more questions correctly than Campbell.\n   - Therefore, the number of questions Kelsey answered correctly is:\n     \\[\n     35 + 8 = 43\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many questions Martin answered correctly:**\n   - Martin answered three fewer questions correctly than Kelsey.\n   - Therefore, the number of questions Martin answered correctly is:\n     \\[\n     43 - 3 = 40\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of questions Martin answered correctly is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
        "To determine how many questions Martin answered correctly, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many questions Campbell answered correctly.\n2. Use the information about Kelsey to find out how many questions Kelsey answered correctly.\n3. Use the information about Martin to find out how many questions Martin answered correctly.\n\nFirst, we know from the problem that Campbell answered 35 questions correctly. Let's denote the number of questions Campbell answered correctly as \\( C \\). So, we have:\n\\[ C = 35 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Kelsey answered eight more questions correctly than Campbell. Let's denote the number of questions Kelsey answered correctly as \\( K \\). Therefore, we can express \\( K \\) as:\n\\[ K = C + 8 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( C \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ K = 35 + 8 = 43 \\]\n\nNow, we know that Martin answered three fewer questions correctly than Kelsey. Let's denote the number of questions Martin answered correctly as \\( M \\). Therefore, we can express \\( M \\) as:\n\\[ M = K - 3 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( K \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ M = 43 - 3 = 40 \\]\n\nSo, the number of questions Martin answered correctly is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
