        "To determine how many cheesecakes are left to be sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial total number of cheesecakes.\n2. Subtract the number of cheesecakes sold from the initial total.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial total number of cheesecakes. The baker has 10 cheesecakes on the display and 15 more in the fridge. Therefore, the initial total is:\n\\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of cheesecakes sold from the initial total. The baker has sold 7 cheesecakes from the display. Therefore, the number of cheesecakes left to be sold is:\n\\[ 25 - 7 = 18 \\]\n\nSo, the number of cheesecakes left to be sold is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of cheesecakes left to be sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cheesecakes remaining on the display after some have been sold.\n2. Add the remaining cheesecakes on the display to the cheesecakes still in the fridge.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many cheesecakes are left on the display after 7 have been sold. The baker originally had 10 cheesecakes on the display. After selling 7, the number of cheesecakes left on the display is:\n\\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \\]\n\nNext, we add the remaining cheesecakes on the display to the cheesecakes still in the fridge. The baker still has 15 cheesecakes in the fridge. Therefore, the total number of cheesecakes left to be sold is:\n\\[ 3 + 15 = 18 \\]\n\nSo, the number of cheesecakes left to be sold is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
