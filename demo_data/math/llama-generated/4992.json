        "To determine the score the last student needs to achieve to make the class average at least 85, we start by calculating the total score required for the class.

Five students scored a 92 each, and four students scored an 80 each. Therefore, the total score of these 9 students is:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 92 + 4 \\times 80 = 460 + 320 = 780 \\]\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the score of the last student. The total score of all 10 students will be the sum of the scores of the 9 students and the score of the last student:\n\n\\[ 780 + x \\]\n\nWe know that this total score must be at least 850, so we set up the following inequality:\n\n\\[ 780 + x \\geq 850 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 780 from both sides of the inequality:\n\n\\[ x \\geq 850 - 780 \\]\n\\[ x \\geq 70 \\]\n\nTherefore, the last student must score at least \\(\\boxed{70}\\) to make the teacher happy.",
