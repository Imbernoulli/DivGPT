        "To determine the total number of hours of the favorite movies of Joyce, Michael, Nikki, and Ryn, we start by finding the length of each person's favorite movie based on the given information.\n\nFirst, we know that Nikki's favorite movie is 30 hours long. We can use this information to find the length of Michael's favorite movie. According to the problem, Nikki's movie is three times as long as Michael's movie. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Length of Nikki's movie} = 3 \\times \\text{Length of Michael's movie} \\]\n\\[ 30 = 3 \\times \\text{Length of Michael's movie} \\]\n\nTo find the length of Michael's movie, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ \\text{Length of Michael's movie} = \\frac{30}{3} = 10 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the length of Joyce's favorite movie. The problem states that Joyce's favorite movie is 2 hours longer than Michael's movie. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Length of Joyce's movie} = \\text{Length of Michael's movie} + 2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Length of Joyce's movie} = 10 + 2 = 12 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThen, we need to find the length of Ryn's favorite movie. The problem states that Ryn's favorite movie is \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) times as long as Nikki's favorite movie. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Length of Ryn's movie} = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\text{Length of Nikki's movie} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Length of Ryn's movie} = \\frac{4}{5} \\times 30 = 24 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow that we have the length of each person's favorite movie, we can find the total number of hours of their favorite movies together by adding the lengths of all four movies:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total length} = \\text{Length of Joyce's movie} + \\text{Length of Michael's movie} + \\text{Length of Nikki's movie} + \\text{Length of Ryn's movie} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total length} = 12 + 10 + 30 + 24 = 76 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours of their favorite movies together is \\(\\boxed{76}\\).",
