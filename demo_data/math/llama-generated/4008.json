When empty, the first floor of the building contains twice as much floor space for storage as the second floor.  The first items he brought into his empty building were several thousand boxes; and he put them all on the second floor, which filled one-quarter of the second floor storage space.  If the boxes used up 5,000 square feet of storage space, how many square feet of storage space is still available in the building?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total storage space available in Bubba's warehouse, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the storage space on each floor:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the square footage of storage space on the second floor.\n   - Since the first floor contains twice as much floor space as the second floor, the square footage of storage space on the first floor is \\( 2x \\).\n\n2. **Determine the storage space used on the second floor:**\n   - The boxes filled one-quarter of the second floor storage space.\n   - Given that the boxes used up 5,000 square feet, we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4}x = 5000\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to find \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 5000 \\times 4 = 20000\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the second floor has 20,000 square feet of storage space.\n\n4. **Calculate the storage space on the first floor:**\n   - Since the first floor has twice the storage space of the second floor:\n     \\[\n     2x = 2 \\times 20000 = 40000\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the first floor has 40,000 square feet of storage space.\n\n5. **Find the total storage space in the building:**\n   - Add the storage space on both floors:\n     \\[\n     40000 + 20000 = 60000\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total storage space in the building is 60,000 square feet.\n\n6. **Determine the remaining storage space:**\n   - Subtract the storage space used by the boxes from the total storage space:\n     \\[\n     60000 - 5000 = 55000\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of square feet of storage space still available in the building is \\(\\boxed{55000}\\).",
