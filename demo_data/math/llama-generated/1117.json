Therefore, the combined cost of rent and utilities is:\n\n\\[1100 + 114 = 1214\\]\n\nSince the rent and utilities are split equally between the two roommates, each roommate's share of the rent and utilities is:\n\n\\[\\frac{1214}{2} = 607\\]\n\nWe know that one roommate pays a total of $757 in all. This total includes the share of the rent and utilities plus half of the cost of the groceries. Let \\(G\\) be the total cost of the groceries for the whole apartment. Then each roommate's share of the groceries is:\n\n\\[\\frac{G}{2}\\]\n\nThe total amount paid by the roommate is the sum of his share of the rent and utilities and his share of the groceries:\n\n\\[607 + \\frac{G}{2} = 757\\]\n\nTo find \\(G\\), we first isolate \\(\\frac{G}{2}\\) by subtracting 607 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\\frac{G}{2} = 757 - 607\\]\n\\[\\frac{G}{2} = 150\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\(G\\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[G = 150 \\times 2\\]\n\\[G = 300\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the groceries for the whole apartment is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{300}\\]",
        "To determine the total cost of groceries for the whole apartment, we need to first calculate the total monthly expenses and then find out how much each roommate pays for the rent, utilities, and groceries.\n\n1. **Calculate the total monthly expenses:**\n   - Rent: $1100\n   - Utilities: $114\n\n   Adding these together:\n   \\[\n   1100 + 114 = 1214\n   \\]\n\n   This $1214 represents the combined cost of rent and utilities for the whole apartment.\n\n2. **Determine individual contributions for rent and utilities:**\n   Since the roommates split these expenses equally:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1214}{2} = 607\n   \\]\n\n   Each roommate pays $607 for rent and utilities.\n\n3. **Find out how much each roommate pays for groceries:**\n   One roommate pays a total of $757.
