        "To determine how many more pencils Dana has than Marcus, we start by finding out how many pencils each person has based on the information given.\n\nFirst, we know that Jayden has 20 pencils. According to the problem, Dana has 15 more pencils than Jayden. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pencils Dana has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pencils Dana has} = \\text{Number of pencils Jayden has} + 15 = 20 + 15 = 35\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Jayden has twice as many pencils as Marcus. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pencils Marcus has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pencils Marcus has} = \\frac{\\text{Number of pencils Jayden has}}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more pencils Dana has than Marcus. We do this by subtracting the number of pencils Marcus has from the number of pencils Dana has:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in number of pencils} = \\text{Number of pencils Dana has} - \\text{Number of pencils Marcus has} = 35 - 10 = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, Dana has \\(\\boxed{25}\\) more pencils than Marcus.",

Use the information given to find out how many pencils Marcus has.\n3. Use the information given to find out how many pencils Dana has.\n4. Calculate the difference between the number of pencils Dana has and the number of pencils Marcus has.\n\nStep 1: Jayden has 20 pencils.\nStep 2: Jayden has twice as many pencils as Marcus.
