        "Let's denote the original population of the town as \\( P \\).\n\nFirst, we account for the changes in population due to the new people moving in and the original people moving out:\n- 100 new people move in, so the population becomes \\( P + 100 \\).\n- 400 original people move out, so the population becomes \\( P + 100 - 400 = P - 300 \\).\n\nNext, we know that every yearward, the town’s population is halved. We are given that after 4 years, the population is 60 people. Let's work backwards step by step:\n\n1. After 4 years, the population is 60.\n2. After 3 years, the population was \\( 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\).\n3. After 2 years, the population was \\( 120 \\times 2 = 240 \\).\n4. After 1 year, the population was \\( 240 \\times 2 = 480 \\).\n5. Initially, after the population change due to the new people moving in and the original people moving out, the population was \\( 480 \\).\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\\[ P - 300 = 480 \\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), we solve for \\( P \\) by adding 300 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ P = 480 + 300 = 780 \\]\n\nThus, the original population of the town was \\(\\boxed{780}\\).",
        "To determine the original population of the town before the new people moved in, we need to work backwards from the current population of 60 people after 4 years. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Population after 4 years:** The population is 60 people.\n2. **Population after 3 years:** Since the population is halved each year, the population before the halving in the fourth year was \\(60 \\times 2 = 120\\) people.\n3. **Population after 2 years:** Similarly, the population before the halving in the third year was \\(120 \\times 2 = 240\\) people.\n4. **Population after 1 year:** The population before the halving in the second year was \\(240 \\times 2 = 480\\) people.\n5. **Population before the new people moved in:** Let the original population be \\(x\\). After 100 new people move in and 400 of the original population move out, the population becomes \\(x + 100 - 400 = x - 300\\). According to our calculations, this population is equal to 480 people. Therefore, we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   x - 300 = 480\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(x\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   x = 480 + 300 = 780\n   \\]\n\nThus, the original population of the town before the new people moved in was \\(\\boxed{780}\\).",
        "To determine the original population of the town, let's denote the original population as \\( P \\). After 100 new people move in, the population becomes \\( P + 100 \\). Then, 400 people move out, so the population is \\( P + 100 - 400 = P - 300 \\). After that, the population is halved each year for 4 years.\n\nLet's work backwards from the information given. After 4 years, the population is 60 people. Since the population is halved each year, we can calculate the population at the end of each previous year as follows:\n\n1. After 3 years, the population was \\( 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\).\n2. After 2 years, the population was \\( 120 \\times 2 = 240 \\).\n3. After 1 year, the population was \\( 240 \\times 2 = 480 \\).\n4. At the start of the 4th year (which is the same as the end of the 3rd year), the population was \\( 480 \\).\n\nThis population of 480 is the population after the population has been reduced by 300 due to the move-out and the move-in. Therefore, we can find the original population \\( P \\) by solving the equation:\n\\[ P - 300 = 480 \\]\nAdding 300 to both sides, we get:\n\\[ P = 480 + 300 = 780 \\]\n\nThus, the original population of the town was \\(\\boxed{780}\\).",
        "Let's denote the original population of the town as \\( P \\). After 100 new people move in, the population becomes \\( P + 100 \\). Then, 400 of the original population move out, so the population becomes \\( P + 100 - 400 = P - 300 \\).\n\nAfterward, the population is halved every year. We know that after 4 years, the population is 60 people. Let's work backwards to find the population at the start of the 4th year. If the population at the start of the 4th year is \\( x \\), then after halving it in the 4th year, the population becomes \\( \\frac{x}{2} = 60 \\). Therefore, \\( x = 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\).\n\nNext, we find the population at the start of the 3rd year. If the population at the start of the 3rd year is \\( y \\), then after halving it in the 3rd year, the population becomes \\( \\frac{y}{2} = 120 \\). Therefore, \\( y = 120 \\times 2 = 240 \\).\n\nNext, we find the population at the start of the 2nd year. If the population at the start of the 2nd year is \\( z \\), then after halving it in the 2nd year, the population becomes \\( \\frac{z}{2} = 240 \\). Therefore, \\( z = 240 \\times 2 = 480 \\).\n\nFinally, we find the population at the start of the 1st year, which is the population after the initial change when 100 new people move in and 400 of the original population move out. If the original population is \\( P \\), then after these changes, the population is \\( P - 300 \\). Since we know that \\( P - 300 = 480 \\), we can solve for \\( P \\) as follows:\n\\[ P - 300 = 480 \\]\n\\[ P = 480 + 300 \\]\n\\[ P = 780 \\]\n\nTherefore, the original population of the town was \\(\\boxed{780}\\).",
