On Tuesday she pulled 25 weeds. The next day she pulled three times the number of weeds she did the day before. On Thursday her allergies bothered her and she could only pull up one-fifth of the weeds she pulled on the day before. Finally, on Friday it rained for half the day and she managed to pull up 10 fewer weeds than she did on Thursday. In total, how many weeds did she pull up?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
