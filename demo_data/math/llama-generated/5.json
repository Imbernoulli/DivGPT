Therefore, we multiply 20 by 0.90:\n\\[\n20 \\times 0.90 = 18\n\\]\nSo, Tara's dad attended 18 games in her first year.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many games Tara's dad attended in her second year. According to the problem, he attended 4 fewer games than he did in the first year. Therefore, we subtract 4 from the number of games he attended in the first year:\n\\[\n18 - 4 = 14\n\\]\nSo, Tara's dad attended 14 games in her second year.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]",
