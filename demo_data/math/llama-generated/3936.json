        "To determine how much Janet paid for everything, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets for the adults.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the tickets for the children.\n3. Add the costs of the adult and children's tickets to get the total cost of the tickets.\n4. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the tickets.\n5. Add the cost of the soda to the discounted total cost of the tickets.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets for the adults.\n   - Janet is buying tickets for 10 people, and 4 of them are children. Therefore, the number of adults is \\(10 - 4 = 6\\).\n   - The cost of an adult ticket is $30.\n   - The total cost for the adult tickets is \\(6 \\times 30 = 180\\) dollars.\n\n2. Calculate the total cost of the tickets for the children.\n   - The cost of a child's ticket is half price, so it is \\(\\frac{30}{2} = 15\\) dollars.\n   - The total cost for the children's tickets is \\(4 \\times 15 = 60\\) dollars.\n\n3. Add the costs of the adult and children's tickets to get the total cost of the tickets.\n   - The total cost of the tickets is \\(180 + 60 = 240\\) dollars.\n\n4. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the tickets.\n   - A 20% discount means Janet pays 80% of the total cost.\n   - The discounted total cost of the tickets is \\(240 \\times 0.80 = 192\\) dollars.\n\n5. Add the cost of the soda to the discounted total cost of the tickets.\n   - The cost of the soda is $5.\n   - The total amount Janet paid is \\(192 + 5 = 197\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Janet paid for everything is \\(\\boxed{197}\\).",

The cost of the soda is $5, so the total amount Janet paid is:\n\\[ 192 + 5 = 197 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Janet paid for everything is:\n\\[ \\boxed{197} \\]",
        "To determine the total amount Janet paid for everything, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the adult tickets.\n2. Calculate the cost of the children's tickets.\n3.

Add the cost of the soda to the discounted total cost of admission.\n\nLet's start with the cost of the adult tickets. Janet gets tickets for 10 people, and 4 of them are children. Therefore, the number of adult tickets is:\n\\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \\]\nThe cost of each adult ticket is $30, so the total cost for the adult tickets is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 30 = 180 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the children's tickets. Each children's ticket is half price, so the cost of each children's ticket is:\n\\[ \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\]\nThe cost for the 4 children's tickets is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 15 = 60 \\]\n\nNow, we add the costs of the adult and children's tickets to get the total cost of admission:\n\\[ 180 + 60 = 240 \\]\n\nSince Janet buys a soda to take advantage of the discount, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of admission. A 20% discount means she pays 80% of the total cost. So, the discounted total cost of admission is:\n\\[ 240 \\times 0.80 = 192 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the cost of the soda to the discounted total cost of admission. The cost of the soda is $5, so the total amount Janet paid is:\n\\[ 192 + 5 = 197 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Janet paid for everything is:\n\\[ \\boxed{197} \\]",
