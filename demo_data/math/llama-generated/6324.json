        "To determine how many more children there are than adults in the church, we start by calculating the number of adults and the number of children.\n\nFirst, we find the number of adults. Since 40% of the church members are adults, we can calculate the number of adults as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of adults} = 40\\% \\times 120 = 0.40 \\times 120 = 48\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the number of children. Since the rest of the church members are children, we can calculate the number of children as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of children} = 120 - \\text{Number of adults} = 120 - 48 = 72\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more children there are than adults. We do this by subtracting the number of adults from the number of children:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Number of children} - \\text{Number of adults} = 72 - 48 = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are \\(\\boxed{24}\\) more children than adults.",
