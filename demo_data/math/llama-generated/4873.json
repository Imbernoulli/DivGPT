        "To determine the total of the numbers that Mickey, Jayden, and Coraline have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Coraline's number.\n2.

Add the numbers of Mickey, Jayden, and Coraline together.\n\nFirst, we know that Coraline's number is 80.\n\nNext, we are given that Jayden's number is 40 less than Coraline's number. Therefore, we can calculate Jayden's number as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Jayden's number} = \\text{Coraline's number} - 40 = 80 - 40 = 40\n\\]\n\nThen, we know that Mickey's number is 20 greater than Jayden's number. Therefore, we can calculate Mickey's number as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Mickey's number} = \\text{Jayden's number} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the numbers of Mickey, Jayden, and Coraline together:\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = \\text{Mickey's number} + \\text{Jayden's number} + \\text{Coraline's number} = 60 + 40 + 80 = 180\n\\]\n\nThus, the total of the numbers they have is \\boxed{180}.",
