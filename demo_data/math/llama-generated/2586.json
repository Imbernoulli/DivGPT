Subtract the number of players who have never lost to an AI from the total number of chess players to find the number of players who have lost to a computer at least once.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The total number of chess players on the island is given as 40.\n\nNext, we know that a quarter of the chess players have never lost to an AI. Therefore, we calculate the number of players who have never lost to an AI as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of players who have never lost to an AI} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the number of players who have lost to a computer at least once, we subtract the number of players who have never lost to an AI from the total number of chess players:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of players who have lost to a computer at least once} = 40 - 10 = 30\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people on the island who have lost to a computer at least once is \\boxed{30}.",
