Determine how many lollipops Marlon had after giving some to Emily.\n3. Find out how many lollipops Marlon gave to Lou after keeping 4 for himself.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many lollipops Marlon gave to Emily. Marlon had 42 lollipops and gave Emily \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of them:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 42 = 28\n\\]\nSo, Marlon gave Emily 28 lollipops.\n\nNext, we determine how many lollipops Marlon had after giving some to Emily. Marlon started with 42 lollipops and gave away 28, so he had:\n\\[\n42 - 28 = 14\n\\]\nlollipops left.\n\nThen, Marlon kept 4 lollipops for himself and gave the rest to Lou. So, the number of lollipops he gave to Lou is:\n\\[\n14 - 4 = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Lou received \\(\\boxed{10}\\) lollipops.",

Determine how many lollipops Marlon had left after giving some to Emily.\n3. Subtract the number of lollipops Marlon kept from the number of lollipops he had left to find out how many he gave to Lou.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Marlon initially had 42 lollipops and gave Emily \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of them. Therefore, the number of lollipops he gave to Emily is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 42 = \\frac{2 \\times 42}{3} = \\frac{84}{3} = 28\n\\]\n\nAfter giving Emily 28 lollipops, Marlon had:\n\\[\n42 - 28 = 14\n\\]\n\nNext, Marlon kept 4 lollipops for himself, so the number of lollipops he gave to Lou is:\n\\[\n14 - 4 = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Lou received \\(\\boxed{10}\\) lollipops.",
