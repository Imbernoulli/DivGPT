Add the cost of the mango lassi.\n4. Sum the costs from steps 1, 2, and 3 to find the total cost of the meal before the tip.\n5. Calculate the tip amount.\n6. Add the tip to the total cost of the meal to find the final amount Hilary paid.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The cost of the samosas is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ samosas} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per samosa} = \\$6\n   \\]\n\n2. The cost of the pakoras is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ orders of pakoras} \\times \\$3 \\text{ per order} = \\$12\n   \\]\n\n3. The cost of the mango lassi is:\n   \\[\n   \\$2\n   \\]\n\n4. The total cost of the meal before the tip is:\n   \\[\n   \\$6 + \\$12 + \\$2 = \\$20\n   \\]\n\n5. The tip amount is 25% of the total cost of the meal:\n   \\[\n   0.25 \\times \\$20 = \\$5\n   \\]\n\n6. The final amount Hilary paid is the total cost of the meal plus the tip:\n   \\[\n   \\$20 + \\$5 = \\$25\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Hilary's meal, with tax, is \\(\\boxed{25}\\) dollars."
