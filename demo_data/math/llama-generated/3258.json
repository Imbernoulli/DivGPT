        "To determine the total distance Greg travels, we need to consider the distance from his workplace to the farmer's market and the distance from the farmer's market back home.\n\nFirst, we know that Greg drives 30 miles from his workplace to the farmer's market.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the distance from the farmer's market back home. Greg drives for 30 minutes at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can calculate the distance using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = 20 \\, \\text{miles per hour} \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 10 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nSo, the distance from the farmer's market back home is 10 miles.\n\nNow, we add the distance from the workplace to the farmer's market and the distance from the farmer's market back home to find the total distance Greg travels:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = 30 \\, \\text{miles} + 10 \\, \\text{miles} = 40 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance Greg travels is \\boxed{40} miles.",
