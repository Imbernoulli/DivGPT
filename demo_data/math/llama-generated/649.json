Subtract the cranberries eaten by elk from the remaining cranberries.\n\nLet's start with the initial number of cranberries:\n\\[ 60000 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of cranberries harvested by humans. Since 40% of the cranberries are harvested, we multiply the initial number by 40% (or 0.40):\n\\[ 60000 \\times 0.40 = 24000 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of harvested cranberries from the initial total:\n\\[ 60000 - 24000 = 36000 \\]\n\nThen, we subtract the number of cranberries eaten by elk, which is 20000:\n\\[ 36000 - 20000 = 16000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cranberries left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{16000} \\]",
        "To determine the number of cranberries left in the bog after harvesting and consumption by elk, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of cranberries harvested by humans:**\n   - The bog initially has 60,000 cranberries.\n   - 40% of these cranberries are harvested by humans.\n   - To find 40% of 60,000, we use the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of cranberries harvested} = 0.40 \\times 60,000\n     \\]\n   -Perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     0.40 \\times 60,000 = 24,000\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of cranberries removed (harvested by humans and eaten by elk):**\n   - Cranberries harvested by humans: 24,000\n   - Cranberries eaten by elk: 20,000\n   - Total cranberries removed:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cranberries removed} = 24,000 + 20,000 = 44,000\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of cranberries left:**\n   - Initial number of cranberries: 60,000\n   - Total cranberries removed: 44,000\n   - Number of cranberries left:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of cranberries left} = 60,000 - 44,000 = 16,000\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of cranberries left in the bog is \\(\\boxed{16000}\\).",
