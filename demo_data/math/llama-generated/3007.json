The hotel has 10 floors, but the last floor (the 10th floor) is unavailable for guests. This means that only the first 9 floors are available.\n2. Each floor has 10 rooms. Therefore, the total number of available rooms is the number of available floors multiplied by the number of rooms per floor.\n3. The calculation is as follows:\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ floors} \\times 10 \\text{ rooms per floor} = 90 \\text{ rooms}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of different rooms Hans could be checked into is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).",
        "To determine the number of different rooms Hans could be checked into, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of floors available for guests:**\n   - The hotel has 10 floors.\n   - The last floor (floor 10) is unavailable.\n   - Therefore, the available floors are floors 1 through 9.\n\n2. **Determine the number of rooms on each floor:**\n   - Each floor has 10 identical rooms.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of rooms on the available floors:**\n   - There are 9 available floors.\n   - Each floor has 10 rooms.\n   - To find the total number of rooms, we multiply the number of floors by the number of rooms per floor:\n     \\[\n     9 \\text{ floors} \\times 10 \\text{ rooms per floor} = 90 \\text{ rooms}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of different rooms Hans could be checked into is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).",
