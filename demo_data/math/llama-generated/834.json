        "To determine how much Janice would need to pay for one sandwich and one juice, we need to find the individual prices of each item. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Janice bought five juices for $10. Therefore, the price of one juice is:\n\\[\n\\text{Price of one juice} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Janice bought two sandwiches for $6. Therefore, the price of one sandwich is:\n\\[\n\\text{Price of one sandwich} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find out how much Janice would need to pay for one sandwich and one juice, we add the price of one sandwich and the price of one juice:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 3 + 2 = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo, Janice would need to pay \\boxed{5} dollars if she would only buy one sandwich and one juice.",
        "To determine how much Janice would need to pay for one sandwich and one juice, we first need to find the price of one juice and one sandwich. We can do this by dividing the total cost of the juices and the sandwiches by the quantities purchased.\n\nFirst, we calculate the price of one juice:\n\\[\n\\text{Price of one juice} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost of juices}}{\\text{Number of juices}} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2\n\\]\nSo, one juice costs $2.\n\nNext, we calculate the price of one sandwich:\n\\[\n\\text{Price of one sandwich} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost of sandwiches}}{\\text{Number of sandwiches}} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\nSo, one sandwich costs $3.\n\nNow, we add the price of one juice and one sandwich to find the total cost for one juice and one sandwich:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost for one juice and one sandwich} = \\text{Price of one juice} + \\text{Price of one sandwich} = 2 + 3 = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Janice would need to pay \\boxed{5} dollars if she would only buy one sandwich and one juice.",
