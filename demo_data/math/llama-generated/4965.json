She recently went on a long trip to Bali. Palmer took 50 new pictures in the first week and twice that many in the second week. She was running out of space at the end of her trip and took only 80 new photos total across the third and fourth weeks. If she adds the pictures from Bali to her collection, how many total photos does Palmer have under her bed now?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
