        "To determine how many calories are remaining in the block of cheese after Rick has eaten some servings, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of calories in the entire block of cheese.\n2. Determine the number of calories Rick has already consumed.\n3. Subtract the calories consumed from the total calories to find the remaining calories.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of calories in the entire block of cheese. Since each serving has 110 calories and there are 16 servings in a block, we multiply the number of servings by the calories per serving:\n\\[\n110 \\text{ calories/serving} \\times 16 \\text{ servings} = 1760 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of calories Rick has already consumed. Since Rick has eaten 5 servings, we multiply the number of servings he has eaten by the calories per serving:\n\\[\n110 \\text{ calories/serving} \\times 5 \\text{ servings} = 550 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the calories consumed from the total calories to find the remaining calories:\n\\[\n1760 \\text{ calories} - 550 \\text{ calories} = 1210 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of calories remaining in the block is \\boxed{1210}.",
