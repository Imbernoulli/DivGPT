        "To determine the population of Beacon, we start by defining the variables based on the information given in the problem. Let's denote the population of Beacon as \\( B \\). According to the problem, Victoria has 4 times as many people as Beacon, so the population of Victoria can be expressed as \\( 4B \\). Additionally, Richmond has 1000 more people than Victoria, and we know that Richmond has 3000 people. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the relationship between the populations of Richmond and Victoria:\n\n\\[ \\text{Population of Richmond} = \\text{Population of Victoria} + 1000 \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 3000 = 4B + 1000 \\]\n\nTo find \\( B \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by first subtracting 1000 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 3000 - 1000 = 4B \\]\n\\[ 2000 = 4B \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{2000}{4} \\]\n\\[ B = 500 \\]\n\nThus, the population of Beacon is \\(\\boxed{500}\\).",
        "To determine the number of people in Beacon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the population of Victoria:**\n   - We know that Richmond has 3000 people and it has 1000 more people than Victoria.\n   - Let \\( V \\) represent the population of Victoria.\n   - Therefore, we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     R = V + 1000\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the given value for \\( R \\) ( Rich NOTIFY):\n     \\[\n     3000 = V + 1000\n     \\]\n   - To find \\( V \\), subtract 1000 from both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     V = 3000 - 1000\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     V = 2000\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the population of Beacon:**\n   - We know that Victoria has 4 times as many people as Beacon.\n   - Let \\( B \\) represent the population of Beacon.\n   - Therefore, we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     V = 4B\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the given value for \\( V \\) ( Victoria):\n     \\[\n     2000 = 4B\n     \\]\n   - To find \\( B \\), divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n     \\[\n     B = \\frac{2000}{4}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     B = 500\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of people in Beacon is \\(\\boxed{500}\\).",
