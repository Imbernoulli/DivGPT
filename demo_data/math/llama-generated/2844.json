        "To determine the total revenue generated by the movie theater on Friday night, we need to calculate the revenue from ticket sales and the revenue from popcorn sales separately, and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the revenue from ticket sales. The theater had 32 matinee customers, 40 evening customers, and 58 customers for an opening night showing. The prices for these tickets are $5, $7, and $10 respectively. Therefore, the revenue from ticket sales is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from matinee tickets} = 32 \\times 5 = 160 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from evening tickets} = 40 \\times 7 = 280 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from opening night tickets} = 58 \\times 10 = 580 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nAdding these amounts together gives the total revenue from ticket sales:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total revenue from ticket sales} = 160 + 280 + 580 = 1020 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from popcorn sales. The problem states that half of the customers bought popcorn. The total number of customers on Friday night is the sum of the matinee, evening, and opening night customers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of customers} = 32 + 40 + 58 = 130\n\\]\n\nSince half of the customers bought popcorn, the number of customers who bought popcorn is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of customers who bought popcorn} = \\frac{130}{2} = 65\n\\]\n\nThe cost of each bucket of popcorn is $10, so the revenue from popcorn sales is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from popcorn sales} = 65 \\times 10 = 650 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the revenue from ticket sales and the revenue from popcorn sales to get the total revenue for Friday night:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total revenue} = 1020 + 650 = 1670 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money the theater made on Friday night is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1670}\n\\]",
