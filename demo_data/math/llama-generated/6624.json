        "To determine the number of fence poles placed along the 900-foot path on both sides, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the effective length of the path that needs to be fenced:**\n   The total length of the path is 900 feet, but there is a 42-foot bridge that does not need to be fenced. Therefore, the length of the path that needs to be fenced is:\n   \\[\n   900 - 42 = 858 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of fence poles needed for one side of the path:**\n   Fence poles are placed every 6 feet. To find the number of fence poles, we divide the effective length of the path by the distance between each pole:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{858}{6} = 143\n   \\]\n   Since the path starts and ends with a fence pole, we do not need to add 1 for the starting point (it is already counted). Therefore, the number of fence poles needed for one side of the path is 143.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of fence poles needed for both sides of the path:**\n   Since the path is being fenced on both sides, we multiply the number of fence poles needed for one side by 2:\n   \\[\n   143 \\times 2 = 286\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of fence poles placed along the whole path on both sides is \\(\\boxed{286}\\).",

Double the number of fence poles to account for both sides of the path.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of fence poles needed for the path without the bridge.**\n\nThe path is 900 feet long, and fence poles are placed every 6 feet. To find the number of fence poles, we divide the length of the path by the distance between the poles and add 1 (since the first pole is at the start of the path).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{900}{6} + 1 = 150 + 1 = 151\n\\]\n\nSo, 151 fence poles are needed for one side of the path without the bridge.\n\n**Step 2: Adjust for the bridge.**\n\nThe bridge is 42 feet long. We need to determine how many fence poles are needed for this 42-foot section. Since fence poles are placed every 6 feet, we divide the length of the bridge by the distance between the poles and add 1.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{42}{6} + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, 8 fence poles are needed for the bridge. Therefore, the number of fence poles needed for the path with the bridge is the total number of fence poles for the entire path minus the number of fence poles for the bridge.\n\n\\[\n151 - 8 = 143\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Double the number of fence poles to account for both sides of the path.**\n\nSince the path is lined on both sides, we multiply the number of fence poles needed for one side by 2.\n\n\\[\n143 \\times 2 = 286\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of fence poles needed for the entire path on both sides is \\boxed{286}.",

Double the result to account for both sides of the path.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of fence poles needed for the entire 900-foot path if there were no bridge. Since a fence pole is placed every 6 feet, we divide 900 by 6:\n\\[\n900 \\div 6 = 150\n\\]\nThis means that there are 150 fence poles needed for one side of the path if there were no bridge.\n\nNext, we need to account for the 42-foot bridge.

The path is 900 feet long, and a fence pole is placed every 6 feet. Therefore, the number of intervals between the fence poles is:\n\\[ \\frac{900}{6} = 150 \\]\nSince there is a fence pole at both ends, the number of fence poles needed for one side is:\n\\[ 150 + 1 = 151 \\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the 42-foot bridge. The bridge covers 42 feet of the path, so we need to determine how many fence poles are needed to cover this section. The number of intervals between the fence poles on the bridge is:\n\\[ \\frac{42}{6} = 7 \\]\nSince there is a fence pole at both ends of the bridge, the number of fence poles needed to cover the bridge is:\n\\[ 7 + 1 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of fence poles needed for one side of the path, excluding the bridge, is:\n\\[ 151 - 8 = 143 \\]\n\nFinally, since the path is being lined on both sides, we need to double the number of fence poles:\n\\[ 143 \\times 2 = 286 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of fence poles needed to line the entire path on both sides is:\n\\[ \\boxed{286} \\]",
