        "To determine how many pieces of candy Mary has in total, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how much candy Megan has.\n   Megan has 5 pieces of candy.\n\n2. Calculate how much candy Mary initially has.\n   Mary has 3 times as much candy as Megan. Therefore, we multiply Megan's candy by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n   So, Mary initially has 15 pieces of candy.\n\n3. Determine how many pieces of candy Mary has after adding 10 more pieces.\n   Mary adds 10 more pieces of candy to her initial amount. Therefore, we add 10 to the 15 pieces she initially has:\n   \\[\n   15 + 10 = 25\n   \\]\n   So, Mary has 25 pieces of candy in total.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
