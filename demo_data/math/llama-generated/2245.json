        "To determine the length of the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon, we start by understanding the given information: the shadows stretch an extra 5 feet every hour past noon, and at noon, the length of the shadows is 0 feet.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total length of the shadows 6 hours past noon:\n\\[ \\text{Length of shadows} = 5 \\text{ feet/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the length from feet to inches.

        "To determine the length of the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon, we start by noting that the shadows stretch an extra 5 feet every hour past noon. Since the shadows are zero at noon, we can calculate the length of the shadows 6 hours past noon by multiplying the number of hours past noon by the rate at which the shadows stretch per hour.\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Identify the rate at which the shadows stretch: 5 feet per hour.\n2. Determine the number of hours past noon: 6 hours.\n3. Calculate the length of the shadows: \\(5 \\text{ feet/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ feet}\\).\n\nNext, we need to convert the length of the shadows from feet to inches.
