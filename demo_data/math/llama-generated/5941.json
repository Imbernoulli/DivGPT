        "To determine how many more volunteers Mr. Johnson will need, we first calculate the total number of volunteers who have already volunteered. There are two groups of volunteers: the students and the teachers.\n\n1. Calculate the number of student volunteers:\n   - There are 6 math classes.\n   - Each class has 5 students who have volunteered.\n   - Therefore, the total number of student volunteers is \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\).\n\n2. Calculate the number of teacher volunteers:\n   - There are 13 teachers who have volunteered.\n   - Therefore, the total number of teacher volunteers is 13.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of volunteers:\n   - Add the number of student volunteers and the number of teacher volunteers.\n   - Therefore, the total number of volunteers is \\(30 + 13 = 43\\).\n\n4. Determine how many more volunteers Mr. Johnson needs:\n   - Mr. Johnson needs 50 volunteers.\n   - He already has 43 volunteers.\n   - Therefore, the number of additional volunteers needed is \\(50 - 43 = 7\\).\n\nThe number of more volunteers Mr. Johnson will need is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
