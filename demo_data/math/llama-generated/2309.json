        "Let's denote the initial number of chocolate cookies Andy had as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, Andy ate 3 cookies and gave his little brother 5 cookies, so the number of cookies left after these actions is:\n\\[ x - 3 - 5 = x - 8 \\]\n\nNext, Andy handed the platter to his basketball team of eight members. The first player took 1 cookie, the second player took 3 cookies, the third player took 5 cookies, and so on. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \\( a = 1 \\) and the common difference \\( d = 2 \\). The number of cookies taken by the \\( n \\)-th player is given by:\n\\[ a_n = 1 + (n-1) \\cdot 2 = 2n - 1 \\]\n\nSince there are 8 players, the total number of cookies taken by all the players is the sum of the first 8 terms of this arithmetic sequence. The sum \\( S_n \\) of the first \\( n \\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (a + l) \\]\nwhere \\( l \\) is the last term. For our sequence, \\( n = 8 \\), \\( a = 1 \\), and \\( l = 2 \\cdot 8 - 1 = 15 \\). Therefore, the total number of cookies taken by the players is:\n\\[ S_8 = \\frac{8}{2} \\cdot (1 + 15) = 4 \\cdot 16 = 64 \\]\n\nSince the platter was empty after the last player took his share, the number of cookies left after Andy and his little brother took their share must be equal to the total number of cookies taken by the players. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ x - 8 = 64 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[ x = 64 + 8 = 72 \\]\n\nThus, the initial number of chocolate cookies Andy had is:\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]",
        "Let's denote the total number of chocolate cookies Andy started with as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, Andy ate 3 cookies and gave his little brother 5 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left after these actions is:\n\\[ x - 3 - 5 = x - 8 \\]\n\nNext, the basketball team consisting of 8 players took cookies in an arithmetic sequence where the first player took 1 cookie, the second player took 3 cookies, the third player took 5 cookies, and so on. The common difference of this sequence is 2. The number of cookies taken by the players can be expressed as:\n\\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 \\]\n\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers is \\( n^2 \\). Here, \\( n = 8 \\), so the total number of cookies taken by the players is:\n\\[ 8^2 = 64 \\]\n\nSince the platter was empty after the last player took his share, the number of cookies left after the players took their cookies is 0. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ x - 8 - 64 = 0 \\]\n\\[ x - 72 = 0 \\]\n\\[ x = 72 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of chocolate cookies Andy had from the start is:\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]",
        "Let's determine the total number of chocolate cookies Andy had initially. We know that Andy ate 3 cookies, gave 5 cookies to his little brother, and then handed the platter to his basketball team. The team consists of 8 players, and the number of cookies taken by each player follows an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 1 and the common difference is 2. Therefore, the number of cookies taken by the players is:\n\n1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15\n\nThe sum of this arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic sequence:\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (a + l) \\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(l\\) is the last term.

Plugging in these values, we get:\n\\[ S_8 = \\frac{8}{2} (1 + 15) = 4 \\times 16 = 64 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of cookies taken by the players is 64. Adding the cookies Andy ate and gave to his little brother, the total number of cookies taken is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 + 64 = 72 \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy had \\(\\boxed{72}\\) chocolate cookies from the start.",

The sum \\( S_n \\) of the first \\( n \\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula \\( S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \\).
