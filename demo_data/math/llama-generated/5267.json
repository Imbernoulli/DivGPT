        "To determine how much more Mary spends than the rest of the firm put together, we need to calculate the total cost of each person's purchases and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Mary's total cost:\n- Platter of pasta: $20\n- Loaf of bread: $2\n\n\\[\n20 + 2 = 22\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost for Elle and Andrea. They will split the cost for:\n- 4 cans of soda: $1.50 each\n- Chicken wings: $10\n\nFirst, find the total cost for the soda:\n\\[\n4 \\times 1.50 = 6\n\\]\n\nNow, add the cost of the chicken wings:\n\\[\n6 + 10 = 16\n\\]\n\nSince Elle and Andrea split this total cost equally, we divide by 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{2} = 8\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate Joe's total cost:\n- Cake: $5\n\nNow, sum up the total costs for Elle, Andrea, and Joe:\n\\[\n8 + 8 + 5 = 21\n\\]\n\nFinally, find the difference between Mary's total cost and the total cost of the rest of the firm:\n\\[\n22 - 21 = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, Mary spends \\(\\boxed{1}\\) dollar more than the rest of the firm put together.",
        "First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mary will spend. Mary is buying a platter of pasta for $20 and a loaf of bread for $2. Therefore, the total amount Mary spends is:\n\\[\n20 + 2 = 22\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of money Elle and Andrea will spend. Elle and Andrea are splitting the cost for buying 4 cans of soda and chicken wings. The cost of 4 cans of soda is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 1.50 = 6\n\\]\nThe cost of the chicken wings is $10. Therefore, the total cost for the soda and chicken wings is:\n\\[\n6 + 10 = 16\n\\]\nSince Elle and Andrea are splitting this cost equally, each of them will pay:\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{2} = 8\n\\]\nSo, the total amount Elle and Andrea spend together is:\n\\[\n8 + 8 = 16\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money Joe will spend. Joe is buying a cake that costs $5. Therefore, the total amount Joe spends is:\n\\[\n5\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find the total amount of money spent by Elle, Andrea, and Joe together:\n\\[\n16 + 5 = 21\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's determine how much more Mary spends than the rest of the firm put together. We subtract the total amount spent by Elle, Andrea, and Joe from the amount spent by Mary:\n\\[\n22 - 21 = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, Mary spends \\(\\boxed{1}\\) dollar more than the rest of the firm put together.",
