        "To determine how many paintings the artist can make in four weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours the artist spends painting in four weeks.\n2. Determine how many paintings she can complete in that total time.\n\nFirst, we know that the artist spends 30 hours every week painting. Therefore, in four weeks, the total number of hours she spends painting is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 120 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we know that it takes her 3 hours to complete one painting. To find out how many paintings she can complete in 120 hours, we divide the total number of hours by the number of hours it takes to complete one painting:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ hours} \\div 3 \\text{ hours/painting} = 40 \\text{ paintings} \\]\n\nThus, the artist can make \\(\\boxed{40}\\) paintings in four weeks.",

Determine how many paintings she can complete with those hours.\n\nFirst, we find out how many hours the artist spends painting in one week. The problem states that she spends 30 hours every week painting. Therefore, in four weeks, the total number of hours she spends painting is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 120 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many paintings she can complete with these 120 hours.

Multiply the number of paintings completed in one week by the number of weeks to find the total number of paintings completed in four weeks.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\nThe artist spends 30 hours every week painting.\n\nNext, we know that it takes her 3 hours to complete one painting. Therefore, the number of paintings she can complete in one week is:\n\\[\n\\frac{30 \\text{ hours}}{3 \\text{ hours per painting}} = 10 \\text{ paintings per week}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many paintings she can complete in four weeks. Since she completes 10 paintings each week, in four weeks she will complete:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ paintings per week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 40 \\text{ paintings}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of paintings the artist can make in four weeks is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{40}\n\\]",
