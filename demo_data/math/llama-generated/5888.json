        "To determine the total amount Pauline will spend on all the items, including sales tax, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of sales tax:**\n   Sales tax is 8% of the total amount purchased before tax. Given that the total cost before tax is $150, we can calculate the sales tax as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sales tax} = 0.08 \\times 150\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   \\[\n   0.08 \\times 150 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, the sales tax is $12.\n\n3. **Add the sales tax to the original total:**\n   To find the total amount Pauline will spend, we add the sales tax to the original total amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost including tax} = 150 + 12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the addition:**\n   \\[\n   150 + 12 = 162\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Pauline will spend on all the items, including sales tax, is \\(\\boxed{162}\\).",
