        "To determine the total number of pets Ed has, we start by calculating the number of each type of pet he has.\n\nFirst, we know that Ed has 2 dogs and 3 cats. We can find the total number of dogs and cats by adding these two quantities together:\n\\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Ed has twice as many fish as the total number of dogs and cats. Since the total number of dogs and cats is 5, the number of fish is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and fish together:\n\\[ 2 + 3 + 10 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pets Ed has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]",
