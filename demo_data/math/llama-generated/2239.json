Therefore, we can calculate the number of green apples as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of green apples} = \\text{Number of red apples} + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the number of red apples and the number of green apples to find the total number of apples in the bowl:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of apples} = \\text{Number of red apples} + \\text{Number of green apples} = 16 + 28 = 44\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of apples in the bowl is \\(\\boxed{44}\\).",
