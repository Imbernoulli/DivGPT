Since \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the 30 students are boys:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of boys} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 30 = 10\n\\]\nNext, we calculate the number of girls in the class. Since the total number of students is 30 and there are 10 boys:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} = 30 - 10 = 20\n\\]\nNow, we determine how many girls own dogs. Since 40% of the girls own dogs:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls who own dogs} = 0.40 \\times 20 = 8\n\\]\nNext, we determine how many girls own cats. Since 20% of the girls own cats:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls who own cats} = 0.20 \\times 20 = 4\n\\]\nFinally, we calculate how many girls have no pets. Since the total number of girls is 20, and 8 own dogs and 4 own cats:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls who have no pets} = 20 - 8 - 4 = 8\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of girls in the class who have no pet is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
