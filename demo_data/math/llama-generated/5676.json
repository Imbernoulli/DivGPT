Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pie pieces the bakery can sell in one hour:**\n   - The bakery makes 12 pies in one hour.\n   - Each pie has 3 pieces.\n   - Therefore, the total number of pie pieces is \\(12 \\text{ pies} \\times 3 \\text{ pieces per pie} = 36 \\text{ pieces}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the pie pieces:**\n   - Each pie piece costs $4.\n   - Therefore, the total revenue is \\(36 \\text{ pieces} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars per piece} = 144 \\text{ dollars}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of making the pies:**\n   - The cost to make one pie is $0.5.\n   - Therefore, the total cost is \\(12 \\text{ pies} \\times 0.5 \\text{ dollars per pie} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\\).\n\n4. **Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:**\n   - The profit is \\(144 \\text{ dollars} - 6 \\text{ dollars} = 138 \\text{ dollars}\\).\n\nThus, the amount of money the bakery would make is \\(\\boxed{138}\\).",
