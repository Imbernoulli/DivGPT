Add the number of jokes Jessy and Alan told last Saturday to the number of jokes they will tell next Saturday.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many jokes Jessy will tell next Saturday:\n- Jessy told 11 jokes last Saturday.\n- If she doubles the number of jokes she told last Saturday, she will tell \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\) jokes next Saturday.\n\nNext, let's find out how many jokes Alan will tell next Saturday:\n- Alan told 7 jokes last Saturday.\n- If he doubles the number of jokes he told last Saturday, he will tell \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\) jokes next Saturday.\n\nNow, let's add the number of jokes Jessy and Alan told last Saturday to the number of jokes they will tell next Saturday:\n- Jessy and Alan told \\(11 + 7 = 18\\) jokes last Saturday.\n- Jessy and Alan will tell \\(22 + 14 = 36\\) jokes next Saturday.\n- Therefore, the total number of jokes they have told so far is \\(18 + 36 = 54\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of jokes Jessy and Alan would have told in total so far, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of jokes Jessy told this past Saturday and next Saturday.\n2. Calculate the number of jokes Alan told this past Saturday and next Saturday.\n3. Add the total number of jokes told by Jessy and Alan for both Saturdays.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of jokes Jessy told:\n- Jessy told 11 jokes this past Saturday.\n- Jessy doubled the number of jokes he told next Saturday, so he told \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\) jokes next Saturday.\n- Therefore, the total number of jokes Jessy told is \\(11 + 22 = 33\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of jokes Alan told:\n- Alan told 7 jokes this past Saturday.\n- Alan doubled the number of jokes he told next Saturday, so he told \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\) jokes next Saturday.\n- Therefore, the total number of jokes Alan told is \\(7 + 14 = 21\\).\n\nFinally, we add the total number of jokes told by Jessy and Alan:\n- The total number of jokes told by Jessy and Alan together is \\(33 + 21 = 54\\).\n\nThus, the total number of jokes Jessy and Alan would have told in total so far is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",

Calculate the number of jokes Alan told next Saturday.\n3. Find the total number of jokes told by both Jessy and Alan on next Saturday.\n4. Add the jokes told on this past Saturday to the jokes told on next Saturday.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of jokes Jessy told next Saturday. Jessy told 11 jokes this past Saturday, and if she doubles that number next Saturday, we have:\n\\[ 11 \\times 2 = 22 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of jokes Alan told next Saturday. Alan told 7 jokes this past Saturday, and if he doubles that number next Saturday, we have:\n\\[ 7 \\times 2 = 14 \\]\n\nNow, we find the total number of jokes told by both Jessy and Alan on next Saturday:\n\\[ 22 + 14 = 36 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the jokes told on this past Saturday to the jokes told on next Saturday. Jessy and Alan told a total of \\(11 + 7 = 18\\) jokes this past Saturday. Therefore, the total number of jokes they have told together so far is:\n\\[ 18 + 36 = 54 \\]\n\nThe total number of jokes Jessy and Alan have told together so far is \\(\\boxed{54}\\)."
