        "To determine how many more chocolate bars James needs to sell, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of chocolate bars James has already sold.\n   - Last week, James sold 5 chocolate bars.\n   - This week, James sold 7 chocolate bars.\n   - Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars sold so far is \\(5 + 7 = 12\\).\n\n2. Subtract the number of chocolate bars already sold from the total number of chocolate bars James originally had.\n   - James originally had 18 chocolate bars.\n   - He has sold 12 chocolate bars.\n   - Therefore, the number of chocolate bars he still needs to sell is \\(18 - 12 = 6\\).\n\nSo, James needs to sell \\(\\boxed{6}\\) more chocolate bars.",
