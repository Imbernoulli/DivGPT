The number of friends who did not respond is:\n\\[ 60 - 30 = 30 \\]\nSo, the number of friends who did not respond is 30. Since Mark initially kept 40 friends, the total number of friends left after the removal is:\n\\[ 40 + 30 = 70 \\]\nSo, the total number of friends Mark has left after the removal is:\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]",

Therefore, the number of friends who respond is:\n\n\\[ 0.50 \\times 60 = 30 \\]\n\nSince Mark removes everyone who does not respond, he removes the 30 friends who did not respond. The number of friends he has left after the removal is the sum of the friends he kept and the friends who responded:\n\n\\[ 40 + 30 = 70 \\]\n\nThus, the number of friends Mark has left after the removal is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]",

Calculate the final number of friends Mark has.\n\nLet's start with the initial number of friends Mark has, which is 100.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate how many friends Mark keeps initially.**\nMark keeps 40% of his friends list.\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 100 = 40 \\]\nSo, Mark keeps 40 friends and contacts the remaining 60 friends.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many of those contacted friends respond.**\nOf the 60 friends contacted, only 50% respond.\n\\[ 0.50 \\times 60 = 30 \\]\nSo, 30 friends respond.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final number of friends Mark has.**\nMark removes everyone who did not respond. Since he keeps 40 friends initially and 30 friends respond, the total number of friends he has left is:\n\\[ 40 + 30 = 70 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of friends Mark has left after the removal is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",
        "To determine how many friends Mark has left after the removal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of friends Mark keeps initially:**\n   Mark keeps 40% of his original friends list. Since he originally has 100 friends, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   0.40 \\times 100 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, Mark keeps 40 friends and contacts the remaining 60 friends.\n\n2. **Determine how many friends respond to the contact:**\n   Of the 60 friends he contacts, only 50% respond. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   0.50 \\times 60 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, 30 friends respond and 30 do not respond.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of friends left after the removal:**\n   Mark removes everyone who did not respond. Therefore, he removes the 30 friends who did not respond. The total number of friends left is the sum of the friends he kept initially and the friends who responded:\n   \\[\n   40 + 30 = 70\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of friends Mark has left after the removal is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",
