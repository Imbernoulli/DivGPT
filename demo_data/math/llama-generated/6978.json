        "To determine the total number of clouds Carson and his little brother counted, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of clouds Carson counted.\n2. Calculate the number of clouds his little brother counted.\n3. Add the two amounts together to get the total.\n\nFirst, we know that Carson counted 6 clouds that look like funny animals. So, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Number of clouds Carson counted} = 6 \\]\n\nNext, we know that his little brother counted three times as many clouds that look like dragons as Carson counted clouds that look like funny animals. Therefore, we multiply the number of clouds Carson counted by 3:\n\\[ \\text{Number of clouds his little brother counted} = 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of clouds Carson counted to the number of clouds his little brother counted to get the total number of clouds they counted together:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of clouds} = 6 + 18 = 24 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of clouds they counted is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
