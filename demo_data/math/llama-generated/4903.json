Identify the original amount of sleep Tom gets per night.\n   Tom originally gets 6 hours of sleep per night.\n\n2. Calculate the increase in sleep.\n   Tom increases his sleep by \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of his original sleep. Therefore, we need to find \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of 6 hours.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. Add the increase to the original amount of sleep.\n   Tom's new amount of sleep per night is the sum of his original sleep and the increase.\n   \\[\n   6 + 2 = 8 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Tom now gets \\(\\boxed{8}\\) hours of sleep per night.",
        "To determine how many hours of sleep Tom gets per night after increasing his sleep by \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the original amount of sleep Tom gets per night.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Original sleep} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the increase in sleep.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increase} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. Add the increase to the original amount of sleep to find the new total.\n   \\[\n   \\text{New sleep} = 6 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hours of sleep Tom gets per night after the increase is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."
