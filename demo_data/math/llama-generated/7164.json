        "To determine the total number of full parking spots in the parking garage, we need to calculate the number of open spots on each level and then subtract the total number of open spots from the total number of spots available.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of open spots on each level:\n- The first level has 58 open spots.\n- The second level has 2 more open spots than the first level, so it has \\(58 + 2 = 60\\) open spots.\n- The third level has 5 more open spots than the second level, so it has \\(60 + 5 = 65\\) open spots.\n- The fourth level has 31 open spots.\n\nNext, we sum the number of open spots on all four levels:\n\\[58 + 60 + 65 + 31\\]\n\nWe can add these numbers step by step:\n\\[58 + 60 = 118\\]\n\\[118 + 65 = 183\\]\n\\[183 + 31 = 214\\]\n\nSo, there are 214 open spots in total.\n\nSince the parking garage has 4 levels with 100 spots each, the total number of spots available is:\n\\[4 \\times 100 = 400\\]\n\nTo find the total number of full spots, we subtract the total number of open spots from the total number of spots available:\n\\[400 - 214 = 186\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of full parking spots is \\(\\boxed{186}\\).",
