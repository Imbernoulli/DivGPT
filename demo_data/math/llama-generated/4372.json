        "To determine the pet store's profit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the selling price of the geckos by the pet store.\n2. Subtract the cost Brandon sold the geckos for from the pet store's selling price.\n\nFirst, let's find the pet store's selling price. According to the problem, the pet store sells the geckos for 5 more than 3 times the amount Brandon sold them for. Since Brandon sold the geckos for $100, we can calculate the pet store's selling price as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Pet store's selling price} = 3 \\times 100 + 5 = 300 + 5 = 305\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the pet store's profit by subtracting the cost Brandon sold the geckos for from the pet store's selling price:\n\\[\n\\text{Pet store's profit} = 305 - 100 = 205\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the pet store's profit is \\(\\boxed{205}\\).",

So, the purchase price for the pet store is $100.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much the pet store sells each gecko for. The problem states that the pet store sells them for $5 more than 3 times the purchase price. Therefore, we calculate the selling price as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Selling Price} = 3 \\times \\text{Purchase Price} + 5 \\]\nSubstituting the purchase price of $100 into the equation, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Selling Price} = 3 \\times 100 + 5 = 300 + 5 = 305 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the profit by subtracting the purchase price from the selling price:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Purchase Price} = 305 - 100 = 205 \\]\n\nThus, the pet store's profit is \\(\\boxed{205}\\).",
