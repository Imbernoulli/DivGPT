Mrs. Finley's class has 24 students, so we calculate half of 24 as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{2} = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more students are in Mr. Johnson's class compared to half the number of students in Mrs. Finley's class. According to the problem, Mr. Johnson's class has 10 more students than half the number of students in Mrs. Finley's class. Therefore, we add 10 to 12:\n\n\\[\n12 + 10 = 22\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of students in Mr. Johnson's class is \\boxed{22}.",
