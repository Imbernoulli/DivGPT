        "To determine how many minutes late Andy will be, we need to calculate the total time it takes him to get to school today and then compare that to the time school starts.\n\nFirst, let's break down the time Andy spends on his journey:\n\n1. **Normal travel time**: 30 minutes\n2. **Time spent at red lights**: 4 red lights * 3 minutes per light = 12 minutes\n3. **Time spent at construction**: 10 minutes\n\nAdding these times together gives us the total travel time:\n\\[ 30 + 12 + 10 = 52 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine what time Andy arrives at school. He left his house at 7:15 AM and it takes him 52 minutes to get there. So, we add 52 minutes to 7:15 AM:\n\\[ 7:15 + 0:52 = 8:07 \\text{ AM} \\]\n\nSince school starts at 8:00 AM, Andy will be late by:\n\\[ 8:07 - 8:00 = 7 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy will be \\(\\boxed{7}\\) minutes late.",
        "To determine how many minutes late Andy will be, we need to calculate the total time he spends getting to school today and compare it to the time school starts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the additional time Andy spends due to the red lights and construction:\n- Andy stops for 3 minutes at each of 4 red lights. So, the total time spent at the red lights is:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 3 = 12 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n- Andy waits 10 minutes to get past construction. So, the total time spent on construction is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n- Adding these times together gives the total additional time spent:\n  \\[\n  12 + 10 = 22 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we add this additional time to the normal time it takes Andy to get to school:\n- The normal time is 30 minutes. So, the total time it takes Andy to get to school today is:\n  \\[\n  30 + 22 = 52 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\nAndy left his house at 7:15 AM. To find out what time he arrives at school, we add the total time it takes him to get to school to his departure time:\n- Adding 52 minutes to 7:15 AM gives:\n  \\[\n  7:15 + 0:52 = 8:07 \\text{ AM}\n  \\]\n  (To add these times, we can break it down: 7:15 + 45 minutes = 8:00 AM, and then adding the remaining 7 minutes gives 8:07 AM.)\n\nSchool starts at 8:00 AM. To find out how many minutes late Andy is, we subtract the time school starts from the time he arrives:\n- The difference is:\n  \\[\n  8:07 - 8:00 = 7 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy will be \\boxed{7} minutes late.",
