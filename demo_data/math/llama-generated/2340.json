        "First, we calculate the total amount of money Kenny earns from mowing lawns. Since he charges $15 per lawn and he has mowed 35 lawns, we multiply:\n\n\\[ 15 \\times 35 = 525 \\]\n\nSo, Kenny has $525 at the end of the summer.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much money Kenny will spend on the video-games. Since each video-game costs $45 and he wants to buy 5 video-games, we multiply:\n\n\\[ 45 \\times 5 = 225 \\]\n\nSo, Kenny will spend $225 on video-games.\n\nNow, we subtract the amount spent on video-games from the total amount of money Kenny has to find out how much money is left for books:\n\n\\[ 525 - 225 = 300 \\]\n\nSo, Kenny has $300 left for books. Since each book costs $5, we divide:\n\n\\[ 300 \\div 5 = 60 \\]\n\nSo, Kenny can buy 60 books.\n\nTherefore, the number of books Kenny can buy is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",

Since he charges $15 per lawn and he mowed 35 lawns, we multiply the two numbers together:\n\n\\[ 15 \\times 35 = 525 \\]\n\nSo, Kenny earns $525 in total.\n\nNext, we need to determine the total cost of the video-games Kenny wants to buy. Since each video-game costs $45 and he wants to buy 5 video-games, we multiply the two numbers together:\n\n\\[ 45 \\times 5 = 225 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost of the video-games is $225.\n\nNow, we subtract the total cost of the video-games from the total amount of money Kenny earned to find out how much money he has left for books:\n\n\\[ 525 - 225 = 300 \\]\n\nSo, Kenny has $300 left for books.\n\nSince each book costs $5, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one book to find out how many books he can buy:\n\n\\[ 300 \\div 5 = 60 \\]\n\nSo, Kenny can buy \\(\\boxed{60}\\) books.",
