        "To solve the problem, we start by determining the initial number of white birds next to the cage. According to the problem, there are six more white birds next to the cage than grey birds in the cage. Given that the number of grey birds in the cage is 40, we can calculate the number of white birds as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of white birds} = 40 + 6 = 46\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of grey birds remaining after ten minutes. After ten minutes, half of the grey birds in the cage are freed and fly away. Therefore, the number of grey birds that remain is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining grey birds} = \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the total number of birds remaining by adding the number of white birds next to the cage to the number of grey birds that remain in the cage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of birds remaining} = 46 + 20 = 66\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of birds remaining is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{66}\n\\]",

Since there are 40 grey birds in the cage, we can calculate the number of white birds as follows:\n\\[\n40 + 6 = 46\n\\]\nSo, there are 46 white birds next to the cage.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of grey birds remaining in the cage after half are freed.**\n\nAfter ten minutes, half of the grey birds in the cage are freed. Therefore, the number of grey birds remaining is:\n\\[\n\\frac{40}{2} = 20\n\\]\nSo, there are 20 grey birds remaining in the cage.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of birds remaining.**\n\nThe total number of birds remaining is the sum of the number of white birds and the remaining grey birds:\n\\[\n46 + 20 = 66\n\\]\nSo, the total number of birds remaining is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{66}\n\\]",

Add the number of white birds to the remaining grey birds to get the total number of birds remaining.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The problem states that there are six more white birds next to the cage than grey birds in the cage. Since the number of grey birds in the cage is 40, we can calculate the number of white birds as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of white birds} = 40 + 6 = 46 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of grey birds remaining after half of them are freed. Since there are 40 grey birds initially, after freeing half of them, the number of grey birds remaining is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of grey birds remaining} = \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of white birds to the remaining grey birds to get the total number of birds remaining:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of birds remaining} = 46 + 20 = 66 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of birds remaining is:\n\\[ \\boxed{66} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of birds remaining after ten minutes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of white birds next to the cage.\n2.
