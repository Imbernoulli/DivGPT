Riley got 3 mistakes out of 35 questions, so the number of correct answers Riley got is:\n\\[ 35 - 3 = 32 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many questions Ofelia got correct. According to the problem, Ofelia got 5 more than half the score of Riley. Half of Riley's score is:\n\\[ \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\]\nSo, Ofelia got:\n\\[ 16 + 5 = 21 \\]\nquestions correct. Therefore, the number of incorrect answers Ofelia got is:\n\\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of incorrect answers Riley and Ofelia got to find the total number of incorrect answers for their team:\n\\[ 3 + 14 = 17 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of incorrect answers their team got is:\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]",

Therefore, the number of questions Ofelia answered incorrectly is:\n\\[ 35 - 21 = 14. \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of incorrect answers from both Riley and Ofelia to find the total number of incorrect answers their team got:\n\\[ 3 + 14 = 17. \\]\n\nThus, the total number of incorrect answers their team got is:\n\\[ \\boxed{17}. \\]",

According to the problem, Ofelia got 5 more than half the score of Riley. Half of Riley's score is:\n\\[\n\\frac{32}{2} = 16\n\\]\nAdding 5 to this value gives:\n\\[\n16 + 5 = 21\n\\]\nSo, Ofelia answered 21 questions correctly. The number of questions Ofelia answered incorrectly is:\n\\[\n35 - 21 = 14\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of mistakes made by Riley and Ofelia to find the total number of incorrect answers for their team:\n\\[\n3 + 14 = 17\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of incorrect answers their team got is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{17}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of incorrect answers Riley and Ofelia's team got, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Riley's score.\n2. Determine Ofelia's score.\n3.

Therefore, the total number of incorrect answers is:\n\\[ 70 - 53 = 17 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of incorrect answers their team got is:\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]",
