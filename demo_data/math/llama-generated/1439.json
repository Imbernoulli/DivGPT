        "To determine the final price of the luxury perfume and how much it is lower than the original price, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the new price after the 10% increase.\n2. Calculate the price after the 15% decrease from the increased price.\n3. Find the difference between the original price and the final price.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the new price after the 10% increase.**\n\nThe original price of the perfume is $1200. A 10% increase in price can be calculated as follows:\n\\[ 1200 \\times \\frac{10}{100} = 1200 \\times 0.10 = 120 \\]\nSo, the new price after the increase is:\n\\[ 1200 + 120 = 1320 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the price after the 15% decrease from the increased price.**\n\nThe price after the 15% decrease can be calculated as follows:\n\\[ 1320 \\times \\frac{15}{100} = 1320 \\times 0.15 = 198 \\]\nSo, the final price after the decrease is:\n\\[ 1320 - 198 = 1122 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between the original price and the final price.**\n\nThe original price is $1200 and the final price is $1122. The difference is:\n\\[ 1200 - 1122 = 78 \\]\n\nTherefore, the final price is lower than the original price by \\(\\boxed{78}\\).",
        "The original price of the luxury perfume is $1200. The store owner first increased the price by 10%. To find the new price after the increase, we calculate 10% of $1200 and add it to the original price:\n\n\\[ 10\\% \\text{ of } 1200 = 0.10 \\times 1200 = 120 \\]\n\nSo, the new price after the increase is:\n\n\\[ 1200 + 120 = 1320 \\]\n\nNext, the store owner decided to lower the price by 15%.

Calculate the price after the 15% decrease from the increased price.\n3. Find the difference between the original price and the final price.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the new price after the 10% increase.**\n\nThe original price of the perfume is $1200. A 10% increase can be calculated as:\n\\[ 10\\% \\text{ of } 1200 = 0.10 \\times 1200 = 120 \\]\n\nSo, the new price after the increase is:\n\\[ 1200 + 120 = 1320 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the price after the 15% decrease from the increased price.**\n\nA 15% decrease on the new price of $1320 can be calculated as:\n\\[ 15\\% \\text{ of } 1320 = 0.15 \\times 1320 = 198 \\]\n\nSo, the final price after the decrease is:\n\\[ 1320 - 198 = 1122 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between the original price and the final price.**\n\nThe original price is $1200 and the final price is $1122. The difference is:\n\\[ 1200 - 1122 = 78 \\]\n\nTherefore, the final price is lower than the original price by \\(\\boxed{78}\\)."
