        "To determine how many old PlayStation games Percy needs to sell, we first need to calculate how much more money he needs after receiving his birthday and Christmas money.\n\nThe total cost of the new PlayStation is $500. Percy receives $200 on his birthday and $150 at Christmas. Therefore, the total amount of money he already has is:\n\\[ 200 + 150 = 350 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount of money Percy already has from the total cost of the new PlayStation to find out how much more money he needs:\n\\[ 500 - 350 = 150 \\]\n\nPercy plans to make the rest of the money by selling his old PlayStation games for $7.5 each. To find out how many games he needs to sell, we divide the amount of money he still needs by the price per game:\n\\[ 150 \\div 7.5 = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, Percy needs to sell \\(\\boxed{20}\\) games to reach his goal.",
