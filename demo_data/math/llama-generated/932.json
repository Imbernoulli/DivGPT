        "To determine how many crayons the factory produces in 4 hours, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the number of crayons in one box.\n   - There are 4 colors of crayons, and each box contains 2 crayons of each color.\n   - Therefore, the total number of crayons in one box is \\(4 \\text{ colors} \\times 2 \\text{ crayons per color} = 8 \\text{ crayons}\\).\n\n2. Determine the number of crayons produced in one hour.\n   - The factory produces enough crayons to fill 5 boxes per hour.\n   - Since each box contains 8 crayons, the total number of crayons produced in one hour is \\(5 \\text{ boxes} \\times 8 \\text{ crayons per box} = 40 \\text{ crayons}\\).\n\n3. Calculate the number of crayons produced in 4 hours.\n   - The factory produces 40 crayons per hour, so in 4 hours, the total number of crayons produced is \\(40 \\text{ crayons per hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 160 \\text{ crayons}\\).\n\nTherefore, the factory produces \\(\\boxed{160}\\) crayons in 4 hours.",
