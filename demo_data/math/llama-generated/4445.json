        "To determine the total volume of Mary's spinach quiche, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the volume of the cooked spinach.\n2. Add the volume of the cooked spinach to the volume of the cream cheese and the volume of the eggs.\n\nFirst, we calculate the volume of the cooked spinach. The problem states that the cooked spinach is 20% of its initial volume. The initial volume of the spinach is 40 ounces. Therefore, the volume of the cooked spinach is:\n\\[\n40 \\text{ ounces} \\times 0.20 = 8 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the volume of the cooked spinach to the volume of the cream cheese and the volume of the eggs. The volume of the cream cheese is 6 ounces and the volume of the eggs is 4 ounces. So, the total volume of the quiche is:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ ounces} + 6 \\text{ ounces} + 4 \\text{ ounces} = 18 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total volume of the quiche is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
