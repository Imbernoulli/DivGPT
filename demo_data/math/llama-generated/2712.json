        "To determine the weight of Bill's improvised weights, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the volume of sand in each jug.\n2. Determine the weight of the sand in each jug.\n3. Sum the weights of the sand in both jugs.\n\nFirst, we calculate the volume of sand in each jug. Each jug is 2 gallons and is filled 70% full with sand. Therefore, the volume of sand in each jug is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ gallons} \\times 0.70 = 1.4 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the weight of the sand in each jug. The density of sand is 5 pounds per gallon, so the weight of the sand in each jug is:\n\\[ 1.4 \\text{ gallons} \\times 5 \\text{ pounds/gallon} = 7 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSince Bill has two jugs, the total weight of the sand in both jugs is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ pounds} + 7 \\text{ pounds} = 14 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThus, the total weight of Bill's improvised weights is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]",

Therefore, the weight of the sand in each jug is:\n\\[ 1.4 \\text{ gallons} \\times 5 \\text{ pounds/gallon} = 7 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the total weight of both jugs.**\n\nSince Bill has two jugs, the total weight of both jugs is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ pounds/jug} \\times 2 \\text{ jugs} = 14 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThus, the total weight of Bill's improvised weights is \\(\\boxed{14}\\) pounds.",
