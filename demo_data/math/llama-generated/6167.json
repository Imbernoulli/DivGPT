Since there are twice as many centipedes as humans, we can express the number of humans as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of humans} = \\frac{\\text{Number of centipedes}}{2} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50. \\]\n\nNext, we know there are half as many sheep as humans, so we can express the number of sheep as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of sheep} = \\frac{\\text{Number of humans}}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25. \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of humans and the number of sheep to find the total number of sheep and humans on the island:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of sheep and humans} = \\text{Number of humans} + \\text{Number of sheep} = 50 + 25 = 75. \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of sheep and humans on the island is \\(\\boxed{75}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of sheep and humans on the island, we start by defining the variables for the number of humans, centipedes, and sheep. Let's denote the number of humans by \\( h \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, there are twice as many centipedes as humans. Therefore, the number of centipedes can be expressed as \\( 2h \\). We are given that the number of centipedes is 100, so we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 2h = 100 \\]\n\nTo find the number of humans, we solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ h = \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we know that there are half as many sheep as humans. Therefore, the number of sheep can be expressed as \\( \\frac{h}{2} \\). Substituting the value of \\( h \\) that we found, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Number of sheep} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of sheep and humans. We do this by adding the number of humans and the number of sheep:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of sheep and humans} = h + \\frac{h}{2} = 50 + 25 = 75 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of sheep and humans on the island is \\(\\boxed{75}\\).",
