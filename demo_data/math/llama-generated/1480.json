She weeded the flower bed, the vegetable patch, and half the grass around the fruit trees. The number of weeds in each section is given as follows:\n- Flower bed: 11 weeds\n- Vegetable patch: 14 weeds\n- Grass around the fruit trees: 32 weeds\n\nSince Lucille pulled half the grass, we need to find half of 32:\n\\[\n\\frac{32}{2} = 16\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of weeds from each section:\n\\[\n11 + 14 + 16 = 41\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine Lucille's total earnings from pulling the weeds. She earns six cents for each weed, so we multiply the total number of weeds by 6:\n\\[\n41 \\times 6 = 246\n\\]\n\nLucille bought a soda for 99 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the soda from her total earnings:\n\\[\n246 - 99 = 147\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cents Lucille has left is \\boxed{147}.",
