        "To determine the total number of pieces in all three puzzles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of pieces in the first puzzle.\n2. Calculate the number of pieces in the second puzzle.\n3. Calculate the number of pieces in the third puzzle.\n4. Sum the number of pieces from all three puzzles.\n\nLet's start with the first puzzle:\n- The first puzzle has 1000 pieces.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of pieces in the second puzzle. The problem states that the second puzzle has 50% more pieces than the first puzzle. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pieces in the second puzzle} = 1000 + 0.5 \\times 1000\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pieces in the second puzzle} = 1000 + 500 = 1500\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the third puzzle also has 50% more pieces than the first puzzle. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pieces in the third puzzle} = 1000 + 0.5 \\times 1000\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pieces in the third puzzle} = 1000 + 500 = 1500\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of pieces from all three puzzles:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of pieces} = 1000 + 1500 + 1500\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of pieces} = 4000\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of pieces in all the puzzles is \\(\\boxed{4000}\\).",

Now, we sum the number of pieces in all three puzzles:\n   \\[\n   1000 + 1500 + 1500 = 4000\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of pieces in all the puzzles is \\(\\boxed{4000}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of pieces in all three puzzles, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each puzzle and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First Puzzle:**\n   The first puzzle has 1000 pieces.\n\n2. **Second Puzzle:**\n   The second puzzle has 50% more pieces than the first puzzle. To find 50% of 1000:\n   \\[\n   0.50 \\times 1000 = 500\n   \\]\n   Adding this to the original number of pieces:\n   \\[\n   1000 + 500 = 1500\n   \\]\n   So, the second puzzle has 1500 pieces.\n\n3. **Third Puzzle:**\n   The third puzzle also has 50% more pieces than the first puzzle.
