        "To determine how much land Jose will have after dividing it equally with his four siblings, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of people who will share the land:**\n   Jose and his four siblings make a total of:\n   \\[\n   1 + 4 = 5\n   \\]\n   people.\n\n2. **Determine the amount of land each person will get:**\n   Since the total land is 20,000 square meters and it needs to be divided equally among 5 people, we divide the total land by 5:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20000}{5} = 4000\n   \\]\n   square meters per person.\n\n3. **Find out how much land Jose will have:**\n   Jose will get the same amount of land as each of his siblings, which is:\n   \\[\n   4000\n   \\]\n   square meters.\n\nTherefore, the amount of land Jose will have after dividing it with his siblings is \\(\\boxed{4000}\\) square meters.",
        "To determine how much land Jose will have after dividing it equally with his four siblings, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total amount of land Jose has initially.\n2. Determine how many people (Jose plus his four siblings) will share the land.\n3. Calculate the amount of land each person will get.\n4. Subtract the amount of land each person gets from the initial amount of land Jose has.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Jose initially has 20,000 square meters of land.\n2. Jose and his four siblings make a total of 5 people.\n3. To find out how much land each person will get, we divide the total land by the number of people:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20,000 \\text{ square meters}}{5} = 4,000 \\text{ square meters per person}\n   \\]\n4. Since Jose is one of the 5 people, he will get 4,000 square meters of land.\n\nTherefore, the amount of land Jose will have after dividing it with his siblings is \\(\\boxed{4000}\\) square meters.",

        "To determine how much land Jose will have after dividing it equally with his four siblings, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people who will share the land (Jose plus his four siblings).\n2. Divide the total land area by the total number of people to find out how much land each person will get.\n3. Subtract the share of land that Jose's siblings will get from the total land area to find out how much land Jose will have.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The total number of people who will share the land is Jose plus his four siblings, which is \\(1 + 4 = 5\\).\n\n2. Next, we divide the total land area by the total number of people to find out how much land each person will get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20,000 \\text{ square meters}}{5} = 4,000 \\text{ square meters}\n   \\]\n   So, each person, including Jose, will get 4,000 square meters of land.\n\n3. Since Jose's siblings will each get 4,000 square meters, the total amount of land that Jose's siblings will get together is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 4,000 \\text{ square meters} = 16,000 \\text{ square meters}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the amount of land that Jose will have after dividing it with his siblings is:\n   \\[\n   20,000 \\text{ square meters} - 16,000 \\text{ square meters} = 4,000 \\text{ square meters}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the amount of land Jose will have after dividing it with his siblings is \\(\\boxed{4000}\\).",

        "To determine how much land Jose will have after dividing it equally with his four siblings, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total amount of land Jose has.\n2. Determine how many people (Jose and his four siblings) will share the land.\n3. Calculate the amount of land each person will receive.\n4. Subtract the amount of land each person receives from the total amount of land to find out how much land Jose will have.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The total amount of land Jose has is 20,000 square meters.\n2. Jose and his four siblings make a total of 5 people. Therefore, the land will be divided among 5 people.\n3. To find out how much land each person will receive, we divide the total amount of land by the number of people:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20,000 \\text{ square meters}}{5} = 4,000 \\text{ square meters}\n   \\]\n   So, each person will receive 4,000 square meters of land.\n4.

Since Jose is dividing this land equally with his four siblings, the total number of people who will share the land is 5 (Jose + 4 siblings).\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of land each person will receive by dividing the total land by the total number of people:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Land per person} = \\frac{20,000 \\text{ square meters}}{5} = 4,000 \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\nSince Jose is one of the five people, he will receive 4,000 square meters of land. Therefore, the amount of land Jose will have after dividing it with his siblings is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4000}\n\\]",
        "To determine how much land Jose will have after dividing it equally with his four siblings, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of people who will share the land:**\n   Jose has four siblings, so including Jose, the total number of people is:\n   \\[\n   1 + 4 = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide the total land by the total number of people:**\n   The total land is 20,000 square meters.
