        "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of questions and answers posted on the forum by its users in a day. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the average number of answers posted by each member:**\n   The problem states that the average number of answers posted by each member is three times as many as the number of questions asked. Since each user posts an average of 3 questions per hour, we first calculate the total number of questions posted by each member in a day. There are 24 hours in a day, so:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Questions per member per day} = 3 \\text{ questions/hour} \\times 24 \\text{ hours/day} = 72 \\text{ questions/day}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the average number of answers posted by each member in a day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ Answers per member per day} = 3 \\times 72 \\text{ questions/day} = 216 \\text{ answers/day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of questions posted by all members in a day:**\n   There are 200 members on the forum, so the total number of questions posted in a day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total questions per day} = 200 \\text{ members} \\times 72 \\text{ questions/member/day} = 14400 \\text{ questions/day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of answers posted by all members in a day:**\n   Similarly, the total number of answers posted in a day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total answers per day} = 200 \\text{ members} \\times 216 \\text{ answers/member/day} = 43200 \\text{ answers/day}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of questions and answers posted in a day:**\n   Adding the total number of questions and answers gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total questions and answers per day} = 14400 \\text{ questions/day} + 43200 \\text{ answers/day} = 57600 \\text{ questions and answers/day}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of questions and answers posted on the forum by its users in a day is \\(\\boxed{57600}\\).",

Add the total number of questions and answers to get the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of questions posted by all members in a day.**\n\n- Each user posts an average of 3 questions per hour.\n- There are 24 hours in a day.\n- Therefore, each user posts \\(3 \\times 24 = 72\\) questions per day.\n- With 200 members, the total number of questions posted in a day is \\(200 \\times 72 = 14400\\).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of answers posted by all members in a day.**\n\n- The average number of answers posted by each member is three times the number of questions asked.\n- Since each member posts an average of 72 questions per day, each member posts \\(3 \\times 72 = 216\\) answers per day.\n- With 200 members, the total number of answers posted in a day is \\(200 \\times 216 = 43200\\).\n\n**Step 3: Add the total number of questions and answers to get the final answer.**\n\n- The total number of questions and answers posted in a day is \\(14400 + 43200 = 57600\\).\n\nThus, the total number of questions and answers posted on the forum by its users in a day is \\(\\boxed{57600}\\).",

There are 200 members on the forum, and each member posts an average of 3 questions per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of questions asked by one member in a day is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ questions/hour} \\times 24 \\text{ hours/day} = 72 \\text{ questions/day} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of questions asked by all 200 members in a day is:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ questions/day/member} \\times 200 \\text{ members} = 14400 \\text{ questions/day} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of answers posted in a day. According to the problem, the average number of answers posted by each member on the forum is three times as many as the number of questions asked. Therefore, each member posts:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ answers/question} \\times 72 \\text{ questions/day} = 216 \\text{ answers/day} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of answers posted by all 200 members in a day is:\n\\[ 216 \\text{ answers/day/member} \\times 200 \\text{ members} = 43200 \\text{ answers/day} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total number of questions and answers to get the total number of questions and answers posted on the forum by its users in a day:\n\\[ 14400 \\text{ questions/day} + 43200 \\text{ answers/day} = 57600 \\text{ questions and answers/day} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of questions and answers posted on the forum by its users in a day is:\n\\[ \\boxed{57600} \\]",

Since each user asks 72 questions per day, the number of answers posted by each user per day is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 72 = 216 \\text{ answers/day} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of answers posted in a day is:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ users} \\times 216 \\text{ answers(user/day} = 43200 \\text{ answers/day} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Sum the total number of questions and answers.**\n\nThe total number of questions and answers posted on the forum in a day is:\n\\[ 14400 \\text{ questions/day} + 43200 \\text{ answers/day} = 57600 \\text{ questions and answers/day} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of questions and answers posted on the forum by its users in a day is:\n\\[ \\boxed{57600} \\]",

Therefore, the average number of answers posted by each member in a day is:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ questions} \\times 3 = 216 \\text{ answers} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of questions posted by all 200 members in a day:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ members} \\times 72 \\text{ questions/member} = 14400 \\text{ questions} \\]\n\nSimilarly, we calculate the total number of answers posted by all 200 members in a day:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ members} \\times 216 \\text{ answers/member} = 43200 \\text{ answers} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total number of questions and answers to get the total number of questions and answers posted on the forum by its users in a day:\n\\[ 14400 \\text{ questions} + 43200 \\text{ answers} = 57600 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of questions and answers posted on the forum by its users in a day is:\n\\[ \\boxed{57600} \\]",

There are 24 hours in a day.\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ questions/hour} \\times 24 \\text{ hours/day} = 72 \\text{ questions/day}\n   \\]\n   So, each member asks an average of 72 questions in a day.\n\n2. **Determine the average number of answers posted by each member in a day:**\n   The average number of answers posted by each member on the forum is three times as many as the number of questions asked.\n   \\[\n   72 \\text{ questions/day} \\times 3 = 216 \\text{ answers/day}\n   \\]\n   So, each member posts an average of 216 answers in a day.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of questions posted by all members in a day:**\n   There are 200 members on the forum.\n   \\[\n   72 \\text{ questions/day/member} \\times 200 \\text{ members} = 14400 \\text{ questions/day}\n   \\]\n   So, the total number of questions posted by all members in a day is 14400.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of answers posted by all members in a day:**\n   \\[\n   216 \\text{ answers/day/member} \\times 200 \\text{ members} = 43200 \\text{ answers/day}\n   \\]\n   So, the total number of answers posted by all members in a day is 43200.\n\n5. **Add the total number of questions and answers to get the final answer:**\n   \\[\n   14400 \\text{ questions/day} + 43200 \\text{ answers/day} = 57600 \\text{ questions and answers/day}\n   \\]\n   So, the total number of questions and answers posted on the forum by its users in a day is \\(\\boxed{57600}\\).",
