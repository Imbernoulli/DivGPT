        "To determine the total cost Jefferson paid for the carriage, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the time it takes for the horse to travel 20 miles.\n2. Determine the cost for the time traveled.\n3. Add the flat fee to the cost for the time traveled.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the time it takes for the horse to travel 20 miles.**\n\nThe horse travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour. Therefore, the time \\( t \\) it takes to travel 20 miles is:\n\\[ t = \\frac{20 \\text{ miles}}{10 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost for the time traveled.**\n\nThe cost per hour is $30. Therefore, the cost for 2 hours is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost for time} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\times 30 \\text{ dollars per hour} = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the flat fee to the cost for the time traveled.**\n\nThe flat fee is $20. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 60 \\text{ dollars} + 20 \\text{ dollars} = 80 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the total amount Jefferson paid for the carriage is:\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]",
