        "To find the percentage of the balls that Veronica carried that were yellow, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of balls carried by Veronica.\n2. Calculate the fraction of the total number of balls that are yellow.\n3. Convert the fraction to a percentage.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of balls carried by Veronica. She carried 27 yellow balls and 33 brown balls. Therefore, the total number of balls is:\n\\[ 27 + 33 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the fraction of the total number of balls that are yellow. Since she carried 27 yellow balls out of a total of 60 balls, the fraction is:\n\\[ \\frac{27}{60} \\]\n\nTo convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\\[ \\frac{27}{60} \\times 100 = \\frac{27 \\times 100}{60} = \\frac{2700}{60} = 45 \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the balls that Veronica carried that were yellow is:\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]",
