        "To find out how much Jackson spent on entertainment in total, we need to add the cost of the computer game to the total cost of the movie tickets. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. First, we calculate the total cost of the three movie tickets. Each movie ticket costs $12, and Jackson buys three of them. So, we multiply the cost of one movie ticket by the number of tickets:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 3 = 36\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total cost of the movie tickets is $36.\n\n2. Next, we add the cost of the computer game to the total cost of the movie tickets. The computer game costs $66. So, we add $66 to $36:\n   \\[\n   66 + 36 = 102\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total amount Jackson spent on entertainment is $102.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{102}\\).",
