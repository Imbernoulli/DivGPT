Since there are 2 days he collects eggs, we multiply:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ dozen/ day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 16 \\text{ dozen} \\]\n\nSince 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we convert dozens to eggs:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ dozen} \\times 12 \\text{ eggs/ dozen} = 192 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs Mortdecai delivers and uses.**\n\nMortdecai delivers 3 dozen eggs to the market and 5 dozen eggs to the mall. So, we add the eggs delivered to the market and the mall:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ dozen} + 5 \\text{ dozen} = 8 \\text{ dozen} \\]\n\nMortdecai uses 4 dozen eggs to make a pie. So, we add the eggs used to make the pie:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ dozen} + 4 \\text{ dozen} = 12 \\text{ dozen} \\]\n\n Again, we convert dozens to eggs:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ dozen} \\times 12 \\text{ eggs/ dozen} = 144 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the total number of eggs delivered and used from the total number of eggs collected to find out how many eggs are donated.**\n\n\\[ 192 \\text{ eggs} - 144 \\text{ eggs} = 48 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of eggs Mortdecai donates to the charity is \\(\\boxed{48}\\).",

Subtract the total number of eggs delivered and used from the total number of eggs collected to find out how many eggs he donates.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of eggs Mortdecai collects in a week. He collects 8 dozen eggs every Tuesday and Thursday. Since there are 2 days he collects eggs, we multiply:\n\n\\[ 8 \\text{ dozen/ day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 16 \\text{ dozen} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the dozen into individual eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we multiply:\n\n\\[ 16 \\text{ dozen} \\times 12 \\text{ eggs/ dozen} = 192 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of eggs Mortdecai delivers to the market and the mall. He delivers 3 dozen eggs to the market and 5 dozen eggs to the mall. Adding these together gives:\n\n\\[ 3 \\text{ dozen} + 5 \\text{ dozen} = 8 \\text{ dozen} \\]\n\nConverting the dozen into individual eggs:\n\n\\[ 8 \\text{ dozen} \\times 12 \\text{ eggs/ dozen} = 96 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of eggs Mortdecai uses to make pies. He uses 4 dozen eggs to make a pie every Saturday. Since there is only 1 Saturday in a week, we have:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{ dozen} \\]\n\nConverting the dozen into individual eggs:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{ dozen} \\times 12 \\text{ eggs/ dozen} = 48 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of eggs delivered and used from the total number of eggs collected to find out how many eggs he donates:\n\n\\[ 192 \\text{ eggs} - 96 \\text{ eggs} - 48 \\text{ eggs} = 48 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of eggs Mortdecai donates to the charity is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]",
