        "To determine the total number of students Ms. Hatcher taught for the day, we need to calculate the number of students in each grade and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Third-graders:**\n   Ms. Hatcher teaches 20 third-graders.\n\n2. **Fourth-graders:**\n   The number of fourth-graders is twice the number of third-graders. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 20 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, Ms. Hatcher teaches 40 fourth-graders.\n\n3. **Fifth-graders:**\n   The number of fifth-graders is half the number of third-graders. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n   \\]\n   So, Ms. Hatcher teaches 10 fifth-graders.\n\n4. **Total number of students:**\n   To find the total number of students Ms. Hatcher taught for the day, we add the number of third-graders, fourth-graders, and fifth-graders:\n   \\[\n   20 + 40 + 10 = 70\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of students Ms. Hatcher taught for the day is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",
