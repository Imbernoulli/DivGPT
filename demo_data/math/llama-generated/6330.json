Now, we sum the strawberries picked by Betty, Matthew, and Natalie:\n\n\\[ 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many jars of jam they can make. Each jar of jam uses 7 strawberries, so we divide the total number of strawberries by 7:\n\n\\[ \\frac{70}{7} = 10 \\]\n\nThey can make 10 jars of jam. Since each jar is sold at $4, we calculate the total amount of money they made by multiplying the number of jars by the price per jar:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money they were able to make from the strawberries they picked is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
        "First, we determine how many strawberries Matthew picked. Since Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 16 + 20 = 36 \\]\n\nSo, Matthew picked 36 strawberries. Next, we know that Matthew picked twice as many strawberries as Natalie, so we calculate the number of strawberries Natalie picked by dividing Matthew's total by 2:\n\n\\[ \\frac{36}{2} = 18 \\]\n\nSo, Natalie picked 18 strawberries. Now, we find the total number of strawberries picked by adding the strawberries picked by Betty, Matthew, and Natalie:\n\n\\[ 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many jars of jam they can make. Since each jar of jam uses 7 strawberries, we divide the total number of strawberries by 7:\n\n\\[ \\frac{70}{7} = 10 \\]\n\nSo, they can make 10 jars of jam. Finally, we calculate the total amount of money they made by multiplying the number of jars by the price per jar:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money they were able to make from the strawberries they picked is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
