        "To determine how many right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of 2 inches can fit inside a square with 2-inch sides, we start by analyzing the area and shape of both the triangles and the square.\n\n1. **Calculate the area of one right triangle:**\n   The formula for the area of a right triangle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n   \\]\n   For a right triangle with a height of 2 inches and a width (base) of 2 inches, the area is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2 \\text{ square inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the area of the square:**\n   The formula for the area of a square is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\text{side} \\times \\text{side}\n   \\]\n   For a square with 2-inch sides, the area is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ square inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many right triangles fit into the square:**\n   Since each right triangle has an area of 2 square inches and the square has an area of 4 square inches, the number of right triangles that can fit into the square is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Area of the square}}{\\text{Area of one right triangle}} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the arrangement:**\n   To confirm, we can visualize the square and the right triangles. If we draw a diagonal in the square, it divides the square into two congruent right triangles, each with a height of 2 inches and a width of 2 inches. Therefore, exactly 2 right triangles fit into the square.\n\nThus, the number of right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of 2 inches that can fit inside a square with 2-inch sides is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

        "To determine how many right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of 2 inches can fit inside a square with 2-inch sides, we need to consider the area of both the triangle and the square.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of one right triangle.

The formula for the area of a square is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{side} \\times \\text{side}\n\\]\nFor our square, each side is 2 inches, so the area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the square} = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many right triangles can fit into the square.
