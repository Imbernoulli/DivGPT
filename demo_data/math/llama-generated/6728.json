He decides that he will take a bus to the town center, walk for 15 minutes to the train center, wait twice this long for the train to arrive, and then take the 6-hour train ride to London. If Luke’s entire trip takes him 8 hours, how many minutes does his bus ride take?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the duration of Luke's bus ride, we need to account for all the components of his trip and set up an equation to solve for the bus ride time. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Walking Time**: Luke walks for 15 minutes to the train center.\n2. **Waiting Time**: Luke waits twice as long as he walks for the train to arrive. Since he walks for 15 minutes, he waits for \\(2 \\times 15 = 30\\) minutes.\n3. **Train Ride Time**: The train ride takes 6 hours, which is equivalent to \\(6 \\times 60 = 360\\) minutes.\n4. **Total Trip Time**: The entire trip takes Luke 8 hours, which is equivalent to \\(8 \\times 60 = 480\\) minutes.\n\nLet \\(x\\) be the duration of the bus ride in minutes. The total time for the trip can be expressed as the sum of the bus ride time, walking time, waiting time, and train ride time:\n\\[ x + 15 + 30 + 360 = 480 \\]\n\nSimplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ x + 405 = 480 \\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), subtract 405 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 480 - 405 \\]\n\\[ x = 75 \\]\n\nTherefore, the bus ride takes \\(\\boxed{75}\\) minutes.",

The train ride to London takes 6 hours, which is \\( 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\) minutes.\n\nAdding these times together gives us the total trip time:\n\\[ x + 15 + 30 + 360 = 480 \\]\n\nWe can simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ x + 405 = 480 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 405 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 480 - 405 \\]\n\\[ x = 75 \\]\n\nTherefore, the bus ride takes \\(\\boxed{75}\\) minutes.",
        "To determine the duration of Luke's bus ride, we need to break down the total travel time into its individual components and then solve for the bus ride duration.\n\n1. ** (%) walk to the train center:**\n   Luke walks for 15 minutes.\n\n2. ** wait for the train to arrive:**\n   Luke waits twice as long as he walks. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 15 = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. ** train ride to London:**\n   Luke takes a 6-hour train ride. Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, we convert this to minutes:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 60 = 360 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. ** total travel time:**\n   Luke's entire trip takes 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 60 = 480 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we sum the durations of the walk, wait, and train ride:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} + 360 \\text{ minutes} = 405 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTo find the duration of the bus ride, we subtract the total duration of the walk, wait, and train ride from the total travel time:\n\\[\n480 \\text{ minutes} - 405 \\text{ minutes} = 75 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the duration of Luke's bus ride is \\(\\boxed{75}\\) minutes."
