        "To determine how many meters Isabel runs during a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Isabel runs in one day. She runs the circuit 7 times in the morning and 3 times in the afternoon. The length of the circuit is 365 meters. Therefore, the total distance she runs in one day is:\n\\[\n7 \\times 365 + 3 \\times 365 = (7 + 3) \\times 365 = 10 \\times 365 = 3650 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many meters she runs in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily distance by 7:\n\\[\n3650 \\times 7 = 25550 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total distance Isabel runs during a week is \\boxed{25550}.",
