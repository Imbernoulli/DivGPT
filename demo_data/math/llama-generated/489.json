        "To determine the combined weight of Barney the dinosaur and the five regular dinosaurs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of the five regular dinosaurs.\n2. Use the information given to find Barney's weight.\n3. Add Barney's weight to the total weight of the five regular dinosaurs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of the five regular dinosaurs. Each regular dinosaur weighs 800 pounds, so we multiply the weight of one regular dinosaur by 5:\n\\[\n800 \\text{ pounds/dinosaur} \\times 5 \\text{ dinosaurs} = 4000 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Barney weighs 1500 pounds more than the total weight of the five regular dinosaurs. So, we add 1500 pounds to the total weight of the five regular dinosaurs:\n\\[\n4000 \\text{ pounds} + 1500 \\text{ pounds} = 5500 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we have Barney's weight, which is 5500 pounds. To find the combined weight of Barney and the five regular dinosaurs, we add Barney's weight to the total weight of the five regular dinosaurs:\n\\[\n5500 \\text{ pounds} + 4000 \\text{ pounds} = 9500 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of Barney and the five regular dinosaurs is \\boxed{9500}.",
