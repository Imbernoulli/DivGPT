        "To determine the length of the walk from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total time Dante spends on his journey if he goes directly to Hidden Lake and then back to the Park Office:**\n   - Time to walk to Hidden Lake: 15 minutes\n   - Time to walk back to the Park Office: 7 minutes\n   - Total time for this journey: \\(15 + 7 = 22\\) minutes\n\n2. **Determine the time Dante spends on his journey if he first walks to the Lake Park restaurant and then goes to Hidden Lake and back to the Park Office:**\n   - Let the time to walk from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant be \\(x\\) minutes.\n   - Time to walk from the Lake Park restaurant to Hidden Lake: 15 minutes\n   - Time to walk back to the Park Office: 7 minutes\n   - Total time for this journey: \\(x + 15 + 7 = x + 22\\) minutes\n\n3. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**\n   - According to the problem, the total time Dante has been gone from the Park Office when he arrives back is 32 minutes.\n   - Therefore, we can write the equation: \\(x + 22 = 32\\)\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   - Subtract 22 from both sides of the equation: \\(x = 32 - 22\\)\n   - Simplify: \\(x = 10\\)\n\nSo, the length of the walk from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) minutes.",
        "To determine the length of the walk from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant, we start by analyzing the given information step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Dante takes 15 minutes to walk to Hidden Lake and 7 minutes to walk back to the Park Office. The total time for this trip is:\n\\[ 15 + 7 = 22 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nWe are also given that when Dante arrives back at the Park Office, he has been gone from the Park Office for 32 minutes altogether. This means that the time he spent walking to Hidden Lake and back is 22 minutes, and the remaining time he spent is the time he spent walking to the Lake Park restaurant. Therefore, the time he spent walking to the Lake Park restaurant is:\n\\[ 32 - 22 = 10 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThus, the length of the walk from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",

        "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we know the total time Dante has been gone from the Park Office is 32 minutes. This total time includes the time he spent walking to Hidden Lake (15 minutes), the time he spent walking back to the Park Office (7 minutes), and the time he spent walking from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant (which we need to find out).\n\nWe can set up the following equation to represent the total time Dante has been gone:\n\\[ \\text{Time walking to Hidden Lake} + \\text{Time walking back to the Park Office} + \\text{Time walking to Lake Park restaurant} = 32 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nSubstituting the known values into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 15 + 7 + \\text{Time walking to Lake Park restaurant} = 32 \\]\nCombining the known times, we have:\n\\[ 22 + \\text{Time walking to Lake Park restaurant} = 32 \\]\nTo find the time walking to Lake Park restaurant, we subtract 22 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ \\text{Time walking to Lake Park restaurant} = 32 - 22 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Time walking to Lake Park restaurant} = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the walk from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) minutes.",

This time includes the time it takes him to walk to Hidden Lake and the time it takes him to walk back to the Park Office. We are given that the walk to Hidden Lake takes 15 minutes and the walk back to the Park Office takes 7 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total time as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time to Hidden Lake} + \\text{Time back to Park Office} + \\text{Time to Lake Park restaurant} = 32 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSince the time to Hidden Lake is 15 minutes and the time back to the Park Office is 7 minutes, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\\[ 15 \\text{ minutes} + 7 \\text{ minutes} + \\text{Time to Lake Park restaurant} = 32 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we combine the known times:\n\n\\[ 22 \\text{ minutes} + \\text{Time to Lake Park restaurant} = 32 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTo find the time to Lake Park restaurant, we subtract 22 minutes from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time to Lake Park restaurant} = 32 \\text{ minutes} - 22 \\text{ minutes} = 10 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the walk from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) minutes.",

This means that the time he spent walking to the Lake Park restaurant (let's call this time \\(x\\) minutes) plus the time he spent on the journey to Hidden Lake and back must equal 32 minutes. We can set up the following equation:\n\\[x + 22 = 32\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we subtract 22 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[x = 32 - 22\\]\n\\[x = 10\\]\n\nSo, the length of the walk from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) minutes.",

        "To determine the length of the walk from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Dante spends on his journey from the Park Office to Hidden Lake and back. We know:\n- It takes Dante 15 minutes to walk to Hidden Lake.\n- It takes Dante 7 minutes to walk back to the Park Office.\n- The total time he has been gone from the Park Office is 32 minutes.\n\nSo, the total time spent walking to Hidden Lake and back is:\n\\[ 15 + 7 = 22 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSince Dante has been gone from the Park Office for 32 minutes altogether, the time he spent before starting his journey to Hidden Lake is:\n\\[ 32 - 22 = 10 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThis means that Dante spent 10 minutes walking to the Lake Park restaurant from the Park Office.
