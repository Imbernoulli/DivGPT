Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the bags of chips.**\n\nJasmine buys 6 bags of chips, and each bag weighs 20 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of the bags of chips is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 20 = 120 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the tins of cookies.**\n\nJasmine buys 4 times as many tins of cookies as bags of chips. Since she buys 6 bags of chips, she buys:\n\\[ 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\text{ tins of cookies} \\]\nEach tin of cookies weighs 9 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of the tins of cookies is:\n\\[ 24 \\times 9 = 216 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the total weights of the bags of chips and tins of cookies.**\n\nThe total weight of the bags of chips and tins of cookies is:\n\\[ 120 + 216 = 336 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.**\n\nThere are 16 ounces in a pound. Therefore, to convert 336 ounces to pounds, we divide by 16:\n\\[ 336 \\div 16 = 21 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSo, the total weight that Jasmine has to carry is:\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]",
