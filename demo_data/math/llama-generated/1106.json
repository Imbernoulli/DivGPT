        "To determine how much money Josie will have left after her purchases, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the cassette tapes:**\n   Each cassette tape costs $9, and Josie plans to buy two.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 9 = 18\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the cassette tapes is $18.\n\n2. **Add the cost of the headphone set:**\n   The headphone set costs $25.\n   \\[\n   18 + 25 = 43\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the cassette tapes and the headphone set is $43.\n\n3. **Subtract the total cost from Josie's initial amount:**\n   Josie received $50.\n   \\[\n   50 - 43 = 7\n   \\]\n   So, the amount of money Josie will have left is $7.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{7}.",
