        "To determine how many customers bought two watermelons, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of watermelons bought by customers who bought one melon:**\n   - There are 17 customers who each bought 1 watermelon.\n   \\[\n   17 \\times 1 = 17 \\text{ watermelons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of watermelons bought by customers who bought three melons:**\n   - There are 3 customers who each bought 3 watermelons.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ watermelons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add the watermelons bought by the customers who bought one and three melons:**\n   \\[\n   17 + 9 = 26 \\text{ watermelons}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the total number of watermelons bought by these customers from the total number of watermelons sold:**\n   - The total number of watermelons sold is 46.\n   \\[\n   46 - 26 = 20 \\text{ watermelons}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine how many customers bought two watermelons:**\n   - Each customer who bought two watermelons bought 2 watermelons.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\text{ customers}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of customers who bought two watermelons is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

So, the total number of watermelons sold to these customers is:\n  \\[\n  17 \\times 1 = 17\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of watermelons sold to customers who bought three melons each:\n- Three customers bought three melons each.

Divide the number of watermelons sold to the customers who bought two melons by 2 to find the number of these customers.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n-.Render customers bought one melon, they bought a total of \\(17 \\times 1 = 17\\) watermelons.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of watermelons sold to the customers who bought three melons:\n- Three customers bought a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) watermelons.\n\nNow, we subtract the sum of the watermelons sold to these customers from the total number of watermelons sold to find out how many watermelons were sold to the customers who bought two melons:\n- The total number of watermelons sold is 46. So, the number of watermelons sold to the customers who bought two melons is \\(46 - 17 - 9 = 20\\).\n\nFinally, we divide the number of watermelons sold to the customers who bought two melons by 2 to find the number of these customers:\n- The number of customers who bought two melons is \\(20 \\div 2 = 10\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of customers who bought two watermelons is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
