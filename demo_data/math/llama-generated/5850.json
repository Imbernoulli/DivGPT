        "First, we need to determine the total number of people participating in the Easter egg hunt. Shonda has 2 kids and their 10 friends, so there are \\(2 + 10 = 12\\) children. She is also屈\t\t\t\nOLLing enough eggs for herself and the 7 other adults, so there are \\(1 + 7 = 8\\) adults. Adding the children and the adults together, we get:\n\\[\n12 + 8 = 20\n\\]\nSo, there are 20 people in total.\n\nNext, we need to find out the total number of Easter eggs. There are 15 Easter egg baskets, and each basket holds 12 Easter eggs. Therefore, the total number of Easter eggs is:\n\\[\n15 \\times 12 = 180\n\\]\nNow, we need to distribute these 180 Easter eggs equally among the 20 people. To find out how many eggs each person gets, we divide the total number of eggs by the total number of people:\n\\[\n180 \\div 20 = 9\n\\]\nSo, each person gets \\(\\boxed{9}\\) eggs.",
