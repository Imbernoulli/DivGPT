        "To determine the total time John spent on his book and exploring, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and add up the times step by step.\n\n1. First, we calculate the time John spent writing up notes. He spent half as much time writing up notes as he did exploring the jungle. Since he spent 3 years exploring the jungle, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent writing up notes} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we know it took John 0.5 years to write his book once he was done with the notes.\n\n3. Now, we add up all the time spent on his book and exploring:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\text{Time spent exploring} + \\text{Time spent writing up notes} + \\text{Time spent writing the book}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = 3 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 5 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time John spent on his book and exploring is \\boxed{5}."
