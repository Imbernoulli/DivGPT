        "To determine the total number of animals bought on the vacation, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how many clowns Tim bought.\n2. Determine how many tetras I bought.\n3. Calculate the total number of animals bought by adding the number of guppies, clowns, and tetras.\n\nFirst, we know that Rick bought 30 guppies. According to the problem, Tim bought twice as many clowns as Rick bought guppies. Therefore, the number of clowns Tim bought is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, I bought 4 times as many tetras as Tim bought clowns. Therefore, the number of tetras I bought is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of guppies, clowns, and tetras to find the total number of animals bought:\n\\[ 30 + 60 + 240 = 330 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of animals we bought on our last vacation is:\n\\[ \\boxed{330} \\]",

        "To determine the total number of animals bought on the last vacation, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how many clowns Tim bought.\n2. Determine how many tetras I bought.\n3. Calculate the total number of animals bought by adding the number of guppies, clowns, and tetras.\n\nFirst, we know that Rick bought 30 guppies. According to the problem, Tim bought twice as many clowns as Rick bought guppies. Therefore, we can calculate the number of clowns Tim bought as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of clowns Tim bought} = 2 \\times 30 = 60\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that I bought 4 times as many tetras as Tim bought clowns. Therefore, we can calculate the number of tetras I bought as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of tetras I bought} = 4 \\times 60 = 240\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the total number of animals bought by adding the number of guppies, clowns, and tetras:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of animals} = \\text{Number of guppies} + \\text{Number of clowns} + \\text{Number of tetras} = 30 + 60 + 240 = 330\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of animals we bought on our last vacation is \\boxed{330}.",
        "To determine the total number of animals bought on our last vacation, we need to calculate the number of each type of animal based on the information given and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that Rick bought 30 guppies. Let's denote the number of guppies Rick bought as \\( G \\). So, \\( G = 30 \\).\n\nNext, we know that Tim bought twice as many clowns as Rick bought guppies. Let's denote the number of clowns Tim bought as \\( C \\). Therefore, \\( C = 2 \\times G = 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\).\n\nThen, we know that I bought 4 times as many tetras as Tim bought clowns. Let's denote the number of tetras I bought as \\( T \\). Therefore, \\( T = 4 \\times C = 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of animals bought, which is the sum of the guppies, clowns, and tetras. So, we calculate:\n\\[ G + C + T = 30 + 60 + 240 = 330 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of animals we bought on our last vacation is \\(\\boxed{330}\\).",

Calculate the total number of animals bought by summing the tetras, clowns, and guppies.\n\nFirst, we know that Rick bought 30 guppies. Since Tim bought twice as many clowns as Rick bought guppies, we can calculate the number of clowns Tim bought as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of clowns Tim bought} = 2 \\times 30 = 60\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that I bought 4 times as many tetras as Tim bought clowns. Therefore, the number of tetras I bought is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of tetras I bought} = 4 \\times 60 = 240\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of tetras, clowns, and guppies to find the total number of animals bought:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of animals} = \\text{Number of tetras} + \\text{Number of clowns} + \\text{Number of guppies} = 240 + 60 + 30 = 330\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of animals we bought on our last vacation is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{330}\n\\]",
