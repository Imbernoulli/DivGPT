        "To determine how many days it will take Socorro to complete her training, we need to calculate the total amount of time she spends training each day and then find out how many days it will take for her to reach 5 hours.\n\nFirst, let's convert the total training time into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 5 hours by 60 minutes per hour:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 300 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of time Socorro spends training each day. She spends 10 minutes on multiplication problems and 20 minutes on division problems, so the total time spent each day is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} = 30 \\text{ minutes/day} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many days it will take for her to complete 300 minutes of training.
