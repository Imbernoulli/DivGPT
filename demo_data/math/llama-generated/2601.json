According to the problem, Venny spent $15000 on a used car, which was 40% of the original price. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n\n\\[ 15000 = 0.40 \\times P \\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{15000}{0.40} \\]\n\nNext, we perform the division:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{15000}{0.40} = \\frac{15000}{\\frac{40}{100}} = \\frac{15000 \\times 100}{40} = \\frac{1500000}{40} = 37500 \\]\n\nTherefore, the original price of the car was \\(\\boxed{37500}\\).",
