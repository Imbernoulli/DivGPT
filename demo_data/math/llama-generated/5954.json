To do this, we find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\\[\nM + \\frac{M}{4} = \\frac{4M}{4} + \\frac{M}{4} = \\frac{5M}{4}\n\\]\n\nNow, we set the equation equal to 1300:\n\\[\n\\frac{5M}{4} = 1300\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( M \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[\n5M = 1300 \\times 4\n\\]\n\\[\n5M = 5200\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 5:\n\\[\nM = \\frac{5200}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nM = 1040\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the size of the master bedroom suite is \\(\\boxed{1040}\\) square feet.",
