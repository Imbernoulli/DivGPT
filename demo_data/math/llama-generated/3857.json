Therefore, the total number of black shirts is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ packs} \\times 5 \\text{ shirts per pack} = 15 \\text{ black shirts}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of yellow shirts. Mandy bought 3 packs of yellow shirts, and each pack contains 2 shirts. Therefore, the total number of yellow shirts is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ packs} \\times 2 \\text{ shirts per pack} = 6 \\text{ yellow shirts}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of black shirts and the number of yellow shirts to find the total number of shirts Mandy bought:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ black shirts} + 6 \\text{ yellow shirts} = 21 \\text{ shirts}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of shirts Mandy bought is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{21}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of shirts Mandy bought, we need to calculate the number of black shirts and the number of yellow shirts separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of black shirts:\n- Mandy bought 3 packs of black shirts.\n- Each pack contains 5 black shirts.\n- Therefore, the total number of black shirts is \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of yellow shirts:\n- Mandy bought 3 packs of yellow shirts.\n- Each pack contains 2 yellow shirts.\n- Therefore, the total number of yellow shirts is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n\nNow, we add the number of black shirts and the number of yellow shirts to find the total number of shirts:\n- The total number of shirts is \\(15 + 6 = 21\\).\n\nThus, the total number of shirts Mandy bought is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
