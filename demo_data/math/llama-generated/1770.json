        "To determine the total weight of Evan's and Ivan's dogs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the weight of Evan's dog.\n2. Use the given relationship between the weights of the dogs to find the weight of Ivan's dog.\n3. Add the weights of both dogs together.\n\nFirst, we know that Evan's dog weighs 63 pounds. According to the problem, Evan's dog weighs 7 times as much as Ivan's dog. Let's denote the weight of Ivan's dog by \\( x \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 63 = 7x \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:\n\\[ x = \\frac{63}{7} = 9 \\]\n\nSo, Ivan's dog weighs 9 pounds. Now, we add the weights of Evan's and Ivan's dogs together:\n\\[ 63 + 9 = 72 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the dogs is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).",

Therefore, we can find the weight of Ivan's dog by dividing Evan's dog's weight by 7:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weight of Ivan's dog} = \\frac{63}{7} = 9 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the weight of Evan's dog and the weight of Ivan's dog to find the total weight of both dogs:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total weight} = 63 + 9 = 72 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total weight of the dogs is \\boxed{72}.",
        "To find the total weight of Evan's and Ivan's dogs, we start by determining the weight of Ivan's dog. We know that Evan's dog weighs 63 pounds and that it weighs 7 times as much as Ivan's dog. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the weight of Ivan's dog:\n\n\\[ \\text{Weight of Ivan's dog} = \\frac{\\text{Weight of Evan's dog}}{7} = \\frac{63}{7} = 9 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we add the weight of Evan's dog and the weight of Ivan's dog to find the total weight of the dogs:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total weight} = \\text{Weight of Evan's dog} + \\text{Weight of Ivan's dog} = 63 + 9 = 72 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThus, the total weight of the dogs is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).",
        "To determine the total weight of Evan's and Ivan's dogs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the weight of Ivan's dog:**\n   Evan's dog weighs 63 pounds and it weighs 7 times as much as Ivan's dog. Let \\( x \\) be the weight of Ivan's dog. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   63 = 7x\n   \\]\n   To solve for \\( x \\), divide both sides of the equation by 7:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{63}{7} = 9\n   \\]\n   So, Ivan's dog weighs 9 pounds.\n\n2. **Calculate the total weight of both dogs:**\n   Evan's dog weighs 63 pounds and Ivan's dog weighs 9 pounds. Adding these weights together gives:\n   \\[\n   63 + 9 = 72\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the dogs is \\(\\boxed{72}\\)."
