        "To determine how many cases of muffins Nora must sell to raise $120, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of muffins in one case.\n2. Determine the total revenue from selling one case.\n3. Calculate the number of cases needed to raise $120.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of muffins in one case. Each case has three packs, and each pack has four muffins. Therefore, the total number of muffins in one case is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ packs} \\times 4 \\text{ muffins per pack} = 12 \\text{ muffins}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total revenue from selling one case. Since each muffin is priced at $2, the revenue from one muffin is $2. Therefore, the revenue from one case is:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ muffins} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per muffin} = 24 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of cases Nora must sell to raise $120. We do this by dividing the total amount of money needed by the revenue from one case:\n\\[\n\\frac{120 \\text{ dollars}}{24 \\text{ dollars per case}} = 5 \\text{ cases}\n\\]\n\nThus, Nora must sell \\(\\boxed{5}\\) cases of muffins to raise enough money for the trip.",
