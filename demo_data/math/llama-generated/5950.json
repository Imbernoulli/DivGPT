        "To determine how much Lizzy will have after her friend returns the loan with interest, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the interest on the loan.\n2. Add the interest to the original amount Lizzy loaned out.\n3. Add the total amount returned to Lizzy's original amount of money she had.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the interest on the loan. The interest rate is 20%, and the loan amount is $15. So, the interest can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Interest} = 15 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 15 \\times 0.20 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we add the interest to the original loan amount to find out how much Lizzy's friend will return:\n\\[ \\text{Total return} = 15 + 3 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the total return to Lizzy's original amount of money:\n\\[ \\text{Final amount} = 30 - 15 + 18 = 33 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Lizzy will have \\(\\boxed{33}\\) dollars.",
