        "To determine how much money Mr. Haj pays for the orders done, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount spent on employees' salary.\n2. Determine the remaining amount after paying employees' salary.\n3. Calculate the amount spent on delivery costs.\n4. Determine the remaining amount after paying delivery costs, which is the amount spent on orders.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount spent on employees' salary. Mr. Haj spends \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the total operation costs on employees' salary:\n\\[\n\\text{acks' salary} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 4000 = \\frac{2 \\times 4000}{5} = \\frac{8000}{5} = 1600\n\\]\nSo, the remaining amount after paying employees' salary is:\n\\[\n4000 - 1600 = 2400\n\\]\nNext, we calculate the amount spent on delivery costs. Mr. Haj spends \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the remaining amount on delivery costs:\n\\[\n\\text{Delivery costs} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 2400 = \\frac{2400}{4} = 600\n\\]\nSo, the remaining amount after paying delivery costs is:\n\\[\n2400 - 600 = 1800\n\\]\nThis remaining amount is the amount spent on orders. Therefore, the amount of money Mr. Haj pays for the orders done is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1800}\n\\]",
