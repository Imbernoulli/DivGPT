        "To determine how many more weekends Cary will need to mow lawns before he can afford to buy the shoes, we start by calculating how much more money he needs to save. The shoes cost $120, and Cary has already saved $30. Therefore, the additional amount he needs is:\n\\[\n120 - 30 = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Cary earns each weekend. He earns $5 for each lawn he mows, and he mows 3 lawns each weekend. So, his weekly earnings are:\n\\[\n5 \\times 3 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many more weekends Cary needs to mow lawns to save the remaining $90, we divide the amount he needs by his weekly earnings:\n\\[\n90 \\div 15 = 6 \\text{ weekends}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Cary will need to mow lawns for \\boxed{6} more weekends before he can afford to buy the shoes.",
