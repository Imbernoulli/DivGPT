        "To determine how much money Oliver is left with after giving his sister $5 and 120 quarters, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the quarters into dollars:**\n   Oliver initially has 200 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ quarters} \\times \\$0.25 \\text{ per quarter} = \\$30 \\]\n\nNext, we add the $5 Oliver gives to his sister to the value of the quarters:\n\\[ \\$5 + \\$30 = \\$35 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total amount given to his sister from Oliver's initial amount of money. Oliver's initial amount of money is the sum of his $40 and the value of his 200 quarters. The value of the 200 quarters is:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ quarters} \\times \\$0.25 \\text{ per quarter} = \\$50 \\]\n\nSo, Oliver's initial amount of money is:\n\\[ \\$40 + \\$50 = \\$90 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount given to his sister from Oliver's initial amount of money:\n\\[ \\$90 - \\$35 = \\$55 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Oliver is left with is:\n\\[ \\boxed{55} \\]",

        "To determine how much money Oliver is left with after giving some to his sister, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the value of the quarters Oliver initially has:**\n   Oliver has 200 quarters.\n   Each quarter is worth $0.25.\n   \\[\n   200 \\times 0.25 = 50\n   \\]\n   So, the total value of the quarters is $50.\n\n2. **Calculate Oliver's initial total amount of money:**\n   Oliver has $40 in dollars and $50 in quarters.\n   \\[\n   40 + 50 = 90\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Oliver initially has $90.\n\n3. **Calculate the value of the quarters Oliver gives to his sister:**\n   Oliver gives his sister 120 quarters.\n   Each quarter is worth $0.25.\n   \\[\n   120 \\times 0.25 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, the total value of the quarters given to his sister is $30.\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount of money Oliver gives to his sister:**\n   Oliver gives his sister $5 in dollars and $30 in quarters.\n   \\[\n   5 + 30 = 35\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Oliver gives his sister a total of $35.\n\n5. **Calculate the total amount of money Oliver is left with:**\n   Oliver initially has $90 and gives away $35.\n   \\[\n   90 - 35 = 55\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Oliver is left with $55.\n\nThus, the total amount of money Oliver is left with is \\(\\boxed{55}\\).",
        "First, let's determine the total value of the quarters Oliver has initially. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 200 \\text{ quarters} \\times 0.25 \\text{ dollars/quarter} = 50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we add this value to the $40 Oliver already has:\n\n\\[ 40 \\text{ dollars} + 50 \\text{ dollars} = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much money Oliver gives to his sister. The value of the 120 quarters he gives is:\n\n\\[ 120 \\text{ quarters} \\times 0.25 \\text{ dollars/quarter} = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of money Oliver gives to his sister is:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ dollars} + 30 \\text{ dollars} = 35 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTo find out how much money Oliver is left with, we subtract the amount he gives to his sister from his initial total:\n\n\\[ 90 \\text{ dollars} - 35 \\text{ dollars} = 55 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Oliver is left with is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{55} \\]"
