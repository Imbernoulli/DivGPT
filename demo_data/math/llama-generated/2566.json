        "To determine the total number of people wearing rabbit ears at the James Bond movie party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of women at the party.\n2. Calculate the number of men at the party.\n3. Determine how many women are wearing rabbit ears.\n4. Determine how many men are wearing rabbit ears.\n5. Add the number of women wearing rabbit ears to the number of men wearing rabbit ears to get the total number of people wearing rabbit ears.\n\nLet's start with the first step. We know that 40% of the guests are women. Since the total number of guests is 200, we can calculate the number of women as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of women} = 0.40 \\times 200 = 80\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of men at the party. Since the total number of guests is 200 and 80 of them are women, the number of men is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men} = 200 - 80 = 120\n\\]\n\nNow, we determine how many women are wearing rabbit ears. We know that 80% of the women are wearing rabbit ears. Therefore, the number of women wearing rabbit ears is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of women wearing rabbit ears} = 0.80 \\times 80 = 64\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many men are wearing rabbit ears. We know that 60% of the men are wearing rabbit ears. Therefore, the number of men wearing rabbit ears is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men wearing rabbit ears} = 0.60 \\times 120 = 72\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of women wearing rabbit ears to the number of men wearing rabbit ears to get the total number of people wearing rabbit ears:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of people wearing rabbit ears} = 64 + 72 = 136\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of people wearing rabbit ears is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{136}\n\\]",

Calculate the number of men at the party.\n   - Since the total number of guests is 200 and the number of women is 80, the number of men is \\(200 - 80 = 120\\).\n\n3. Determine how many women are wearing rabbit ears.\n   - We know that 80% of the women are wearing rabbit ears.\n   - Therefore, the number of women wearing rabbit ears is \\(0.80 \\times 80 = 64\\).\n\n4. Determine how many men are wearing rabbit ears.\n   - We know that 60% of the men are wearing rabbit ears.\n   - Therefore, the number of men wearing rabbit ears is \\(0.60 \\times 120 = 72\\).\n\n5. Add the number of women wearing rabbit ears to the number of men wearing rabbit ears to get the total number of people wearing rabbit ears.\n   - The total number of people wearing rabbit ears is \\(64 + 72 = 136\\).\n\nThus, the total number of people wearing rabbit ears is \\(\\boxed{136}\\).",
