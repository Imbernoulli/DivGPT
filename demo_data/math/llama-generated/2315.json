        "To determine how many coats Andy can make, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of minks Andy initially has.\n2. Determine how many baby minks are born.\n3.

Determine how many coats can be made from the remaining minks.\n\nLet's start with the initial number of minks Andy buys:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minks} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of baby minks born. Since each mink has 6 babies:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minks} \\times 6 \\text{ babies per mink} = 180 \\text{ baby minks} \\]\n\nNow, we find the total number of minks after the babies are born:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ initial minks} + 180 \\text{ baby minks} = 210 \\text{ minks} \\]\n\nThen, we determine how many minks are set free by the activists. Since half of the total minks are set free:\n\\[ \\frac{210 \\text{ minks}}{2} = 105 \\text{ minks} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of minks remaining:\n\\[ 210 \\text{ minks} - 105 \\text{ minks} = 105 \\text{ minks} \\]\n\nFinally, we determine how many coats can be made from the remaining minks. Since it takes 15 mink skins to make one coat:\n\\[ \\frac{105 \\text{ minks}}{15 \\text{ minks per coat}} = 7 \\text{ coats} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of coats Andy can make is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]",
