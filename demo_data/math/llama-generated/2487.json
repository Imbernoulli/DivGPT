        "To determine how many slices of pizza the waiter ate, we start by understanding the ratio in which Buzz shared the pizza with the waiter. The ratio given is 5:8, meaning for every 5 slices Buzz gets, the waiter gets 8 slices.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio:\n\\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many slices each part represents by dividing the total number of slices by the total number of parts:\n\\[ \\frac{78}{13} = 6 \\]\n\nNow, we determine how many slices the waiter gets by multiplying the number of parts the waiter has by the number of slices per part:\n\\[ 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\]\n\nFinally, we find twenty less than the number of slices the waiter ate:\n\\[ 48 - 20 = 28 \\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]",
        "To determine how many slices of pizza the waiter ate, we start by finding the total number of parts in the ratio of 5:8. The ratio 5:8 means that the pizza is divided into 5 + 8 = 13 parts.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of slices corresponding to each part. Since the pizza has 78 slices, we divide 78 by 13:\n\\[\n\\frac{78}{13} = 6\n\\]\nThis means that each part of the ratio corresponds to 6 slices of pizza.\n\nSince the waiter's ratio is 8, we multiply the number of slices per part by 8 to find out how many slices the waiter ate:\n\\[\n8 \\times 6 = 48\n\\]\nThe waiter ate 48 slices of pizza. To find twenty less than the number of slices the waiter ate, we subtract 20 from 48:\n\\[\n48 - 20 = 28\n\\]\nTherefore, twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate is \\boxed{28}.",
