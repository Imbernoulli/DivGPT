        "To determine Kody's current age, we start by defining the current ages of Kody and Mohamed. Let's denote Kody's current age by \\( K \\) and Mohamed's current age by \\( M \\).\n\nWe know from the problem statement that Mohamed is currently twice 30 years old. Therefore, we can calculate Mohamed's current age as follows:\n\\[\nM = 2 \\times 30 = 60\n\\]\nSo, Mohamed is currently 60 years old.\n\nNext, we use the information given about their ages four years ago. Four years ago, Kody was half as old as Mohamed. Therefore, four years ago, Kody's age was \\( K - 4 \\) and Mohamed's age was \\( M - 4 \\). According to the problem, four years ago, Kody's age was half of Mohamed's age at that time. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\\[\nK - 4 = \\frac{1}{2} (M - 4)\n\\]\nSince we already know that \\( M = 60 \\), we substitute 60 for \\( M \\) in the equation:\n\\[\nK - 4 = \\frac{1}{2} (60 - 4)\n\\]\nSimplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\\[\nK - 4 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 56\n\\]\nCalculate the right-hand side of the equation:\n\\[\nK - 4 = 28\n\\]\nTo find Kody's current age, we add 4 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nK = 28 + 4 = 32\n\\]\nTherefore, Kody is currently \\(\\boxed{32}\\) years old.",
