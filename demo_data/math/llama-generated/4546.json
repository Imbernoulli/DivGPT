        "To determine the total number of bowling balls at the bowling alley, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of red bowling balls.\n2. Calculate the number of green bowling balls.\n3. Add the number of red bowling balls and the number of green bowling balls to get the total.\n\nFirst, we know from the problem statement that there are 30 red bowling balls. So, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Number of red bowling balls} = 30 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many green bowling balls there are. The problem states that there are 6 more green bowling balls than red. Therefore, we can calculate the number of green bowling balls as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of green bowling balls} = \\text{Number of red bowling balls} + 6 = 30 + 6 = 36 \\]\n\nNow, to find the total number of bowling balls, we add the number of red bowling balls and the number of green bowling balls:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of bowling balls} = \\text{Number of red bowling balls} + \\text{Number of green bowling balls} = 30 + 36 = 66 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of bowling balls is:\n\\[ \\boxed{66} \\]",
