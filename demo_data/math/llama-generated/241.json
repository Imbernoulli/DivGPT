        "To determine Alma's score in the test, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.\n\nLet \\( A \\) be Alma's age and \\( M \\) be Melina's age. According to the problem, Melina is three times as old as Alma. Since Melina is 60 years old, we can write:\n\\[ M = 3A \\]\nGiven that \\( M = 60 \\), we substitute 60 for \\( M \\) in the equation:\n\\[ 60 = 3A \\]\nTo find Alma's age, we solve for \\( A \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ A = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\]\nSo, Alma is 20 years old.\n\nNext, we use the information that the sum of the ages of Alma and Melina is twice the total number of points Alma scored in a test.
