        "To determine how much Company A gets in profit, we start by understanding the given information:\n\n1. Company B receives 40% of the combined profits.\n2. Company B's total profit is $60,000.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total combined profit. Let \\( P \\) be the total combined profit. According to the problem, Company B receives 40% of \\( P \\). This can be expressed as:\n\\[\n0.40P = 60000\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), we solve for \\( P \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{60000}{0.40}\n\\]\n\nNext, we perform the division:\n\\[\nP = 150000\n\\]\n\nNow that we know the total combined profit is $150,000, we need to find out how much Company A gets. Company A receives 60% of the combined profit. This can be calculated as:\n\\[\n0.60P = 0.60 \\times 150000\n\\]\n\nWe perform the multiplication:\n\\[\n0.60 \\times 150000 = 90000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Company A gets \\(\\boxed{90000}\\) dollars in profit.",
