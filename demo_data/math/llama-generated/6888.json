        "To determine how much more money Nancy will make by turning all her jade into elephants instead of giraffes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of jade required to make one elephant statue.\n2. Determine how many giraffe statues Nancy can make with 1920 grams of jade.\n3. Determine how many elephant statues Nancy can make with 1920 grams of jade.\n4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the giraffe statues.\n5. Calculate the total revenue from selling the elephant statues.\n6. Find the difference between the total revenue from selling the elephant statues and the total revenue from selling the giraffe statues.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of jade required to make one elephant statue:**\n   An elephant statue takes twice as much jade as a giraffe statue. Since a giraffe statue takes 120 grams of jade, an elephant statue takes:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 120 = 240 \\text{ grams}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many giraffe statues Nancy can make with 1920 grams of jade:**\n   To find out how many giraffe statues Nancy can make, we divide the total amount of jade by the amount of jade required for one giraffe statue:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1920}{120} = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Nancy can make 16 giraffe statues.\n\n3. **Determine how many elephant statues Nancy can make with 1920 grams of jade:**\n   To find out how many elephant statues Nancy can make, we divide the total amount of jade by the amount of jade required for one elephant statue:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1920}{240} = 8\n   \\]\n   So, Nancy can make 8 elephant statues.\n\n4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the giraffe statues:**\n   Each giraffe statue sells for $150. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 16 giraffe statues is:\n   \\[\n   16 \\times 150 = 2400\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the elephant statues:**\n   Each elephant statue sells for $350. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 8 elephant statues is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 350 = 2800\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find the difference between the total revenue from selling the elephant statues and the total revenue from selling the giraffe statues:**\n   The difference is:\n   \\[\n   2800 - 2400 = 400\n   \\]\n\nSo, Nancy will make \\(\\boxed{400}\\) dollars more by turning all her jade into elephants instead of giraffes.",
        "To determine how much more money Nancy will make by turning all her jade into elephants instead of giraffes, we need to calculate the revenue from each option and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the revenue from turning the jade into giraffes:\n1. Each giraffe statue requires 120 grams of jade.\n2. Nancy has 1920 grams of jade.\n3. The number of giraffe statues Nancy can make is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1920 \\text{ grams}}{120 \\text{ grams statues}} = 16 \\text{ statues}\n   \\]\n4. Each giraffe statue sells for $150.\n5. The total revenue from selling 16 giraffe statues is:\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ statues} \\times 150 \\text{ dollarsienen} = 2400 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from turning the jade into elephants:\n1. Each elephant statue requires twice as much jade as a giraffe statue, so each elephant statue requires:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 120 \\text{ grams} = 240 \\text{ grams}\n   \\]\n2. Nancy has 1920 grams of jade.\n3. The number of elephant statues Nancy can make is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1920 \\text{ grams}}{240 \\text{ grams statues}} = 8 \\text{ statues}\n   \\]\n4. Each elephant statue sells for $350.\n5. The total revenue from selling 8 elephant statues is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ statues} \\times 350 \\text{ dollars earth} = 2800 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nFinally, let's find the difference in revenue between selling elephant statues and giraffe statues:\n\\[\n2800 \\text{ dollars} - 2400 \\text{ dollars} = 400 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Nancy will make \\(\\boxed{400}\\) dollars more by turning all her jade into elephants instead of giraffes.",

Determine how many elephant statues Nancy can make with 1920 grams of jade.\n4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the giraffe statues.\n5. Calculate the total revenue from selling the elephant statues.\n6. Find the difference in revenue between selling elephant statues and giraffe statues.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount of jade required to make one elephant statue.**\n\nAn elephant statue takes twice as much jade as a giraffe statue.

We do this by dividing the total amount of jade by the amount needed for one giraffe statue:\n\\[ \\frac{1920}{120} = 16 \\text{ giraffe statues} \\]\n\nThe total revenue from selling 16 giraffe statues is:\n\\[ 16 \\times 150 = 2400 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we determine how many elephant statues Nancy can make with 1920 grams of jade. We do this by dividing the total amount of jade by the amount needed for one elephant statue:\n\\[ \\frac{1920}{240} = 8 \\text{ elephant statues} \\]\n\nThe total revenue from selling 8 elephant statues is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 350 = 2800 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference in revenue between selling elephant statues and giraffe statues:\n\\[ 2800 - 2400 = 400 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Nancy will make \\(\\boxed{400}\\) dollars more by turning all her jade into elephants instead of giraffes.",

Since a giraffe statue takes 120 grams of jade, an elephant statue takes:\n\\[ 2 \\times 120 = 240 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many giraffe statues Nancy can make with 1920 grams of jade.**\nTo find out how many giraffe statues Nancy can make, we divide the total amount of jade by the amount required for one giraffe statue:\n\\[ \\frac{1920}{120} = 16 \\text{ giraffe statues} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many elephant statues Nancy can make with 1920 grams of jade.**\nTo find out how many elephant statues Nancy can make, we divide the total amount of jade by the amount required for one elephant statue:\n\\[ \\frac{1920}{240} = 8 \\text{ elephant statues} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling the giraffe statues.**\nThe revenue from selling one giraffe statue is $150. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 16 giraffe statues is:\n\\[ 16 \\times 150 = 2400 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total revenue from selling the elephant statues.**\nThe revenue from selling one elephant statue is $350. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 8 elephant statues is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 350 = 2800 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 6: Find the difference in revenue between the elephant statues and the giraffe statues.**\nThe difference in revenue is:\n\\[ 2800 - 2400 = 400 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, Nancy will make \\(\\boxed{400}\\) dollars more by turning all her jade into elephants instead of giraffes.",
        "To determine how much more money Nancy will make by turning her jade into elephants instead of giraffes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of jade required for one elephant statue.\n2. Determine how many giraffe statues Nancy can make with 1920 grams of jade.\n3. Determine how many elephant statues Nancy can make with 1920 grams of jade.\n4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the giraffe statues.\n5. Calculate the total revenue from selling the elephant statues.\n6. Find the difference in revenue between the elephant statues and the giraffe statues.\n\nFirst, we know that an elephant statue takes twice as much jade as a giraffe statue. Since a giraffe statue takes 120 grams of jade, an elephant statue takes:\n\\[ 120 \\times 2 = 240 \\text{ grams of jade} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many giraffe statues Nancy can make with 1920 grams of jade:\n\\[ \\frac{1920}{120} = 16 \\text{ giraffe statues} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate how many elephant statues Nancy can make with 1920 grams of jade:\n\\[ \\frac{1920}{240} = 8 \\text{ elephant statues} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total revenue from selling the giraffe statues. Since each giraffe statue sells for $150, the total revenue from 16 giraffe statues is:\n\\[ 16 \\times 150 = 2400 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue from selling the elephant statues. Since each elephant statue sells for $350, the total revenue from 8 elephant statues is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 350 = 2800 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference in revenue between the elephant statues and the giraffe statues:\n\\[ 2800 - 2400 = 400 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Nancy will make \\(\\boxed{400}\\) dollars more by turning all her jade into elephants instead of giraffes."
