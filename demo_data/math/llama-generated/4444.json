Since he reads the same number of pages per hour as before, we first find out how many pages he reads per hour:\n\\[ \\text{Pages per hour} = \\frac{100 \\text{ pages}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 50 \\text{ pages per hour} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of pages he reads in 5 hours:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ pages per hour} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 250 \\text{ pages per day} \\]\n\nSo, Mark now reads 250 pages a day.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pages Mark reads in a week.**\n\nThere are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of pages he reads each day by 7:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ pages per day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 1750 \\text{ pages per week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages Mark reads a week now is \\(\\boxed{1750}\\).",
