        "To determine how many pills Antonia has left after filling her pillbox with one pill of each supplement for 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pills Antonia uses in one week.\n2. Calculate the total number of pills Antonia uses in two weeks.\n3. Determine the initial number of pills in all five bottles.\n4. Subtract the total number of pills used in two weeks from the initial number of pills.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pills Antonia uses in one week.

Three bottles have 120 pills each and two bottles have 30 pills each, so the total number of pills is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 120 + 2 \\times 30 = 360 + 60 = 420 \\text{ pills} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of pills used in two weeks from the initial number of pills:\n\\[ 420 \\text{ pills} - 70 \\text{ pills} = 350 \\text{ pills} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pills Antonia has left from all 5 bottles is \\(\\boxed{350}\\).",
