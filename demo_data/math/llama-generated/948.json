        "To determine the total amount of fish sold in two weeks, we start by calculating the amount of salmon sold in the second week. According to the problem, the fishmonger sold three times more salmon in the second week than in the first week. Since he sold 50 kg of salmon in the first week, we can calculate the amount sold in the second week as follows:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 50 = 150 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nNext, we find the total amount of fish sold over the two weeks by adding the amount sold in the first week to the amount sold in the second week:\n\n\\[ 50 + 150 = 200 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of fish sold in two weeks is \\(\\boxed{200}\\).",
        "To determine the total amount of fish sold in two weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.\n\n1. Identify the amount of salmon sold in the first week.\n   The fishmonger sold 50 kg of salmon in the first week.\n\n2. Calculate the amount of salmon sold in the second week.\n   According to the problem, the fishmonger sold three times more salmon in the second week than in the first week. Therefore, we multiply the amount sold in the first week by 3:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ kg} \\times 3 = 150 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n\n3. Find the total amount of salmon sold over the two weeks by adding the amounts sold in each week.\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ kg} + 150 \\text{ kg} = 200 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of fish sold in two weeks is \\boxed{200}.",
