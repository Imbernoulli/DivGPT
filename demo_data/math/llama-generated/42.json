        "To determine the monthly payment, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discount on the television.\n2. Determine the total cost after the discount.\n3. Subtract the first installment from the total cost to find the remaining amount.\n4. Divide the remaining amount by the number of monthly installments.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discount on the television.**\n\nThe original price of the television is $480, and the discount is 5%. Therefore, the discount amount is:\n\\[ 480 \\times \\frac{5}{100} = 480 \\times 0.05 = 24 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total cost after the discount.**\n\nSubtract the discount from the original price:\n\\[ 480 - 24 = 456 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the first installment from the total cost to find the remaining amount.**\n\nThe first installment is $150. Therefore, the remaining amount is:\n\\[ 456 - 150 = 306 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Divide the remaining amount by the number of monthly installments.**\n\nThe remaining amount is to be paid in 3 monthly installments. Therefore, the amount of each monthly payment is:\n\\[ 306 \\div 3 = 102 \\]\n\nThe amount of a monthly payment is \\(\\boxed{102}\\).",
        "First, we need to calculate the discount on the television. The television originally costs $480, and the discount is 5%. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 5%:\n\n\\[\n480 \\times 0.05 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, the discount is $24. To find the price after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original price:\n\n\\[\n480 - 24 = 456\n\\]\n\nThe price after the discount is $456. Next, we need to determine the remaining amount after the first installment of $150 is paid. We subtract the first installment from the discounted price:\n\n\\[\n456 - 150 = 306\n\\]\n\nThe remaining amount is $306. This remaining amount will be paid in 3 monthly installments. To find the amount of each monthly payment, we divide the remaining amount by 3:\n\n\\[\n306 \\div 3 = 102\n\\]\n\nSo, the amount of each monthly payment is \\(\\boxed{102}\\).",

Subtract the first installment from the total cost to find out the remaining amount to be paid:\n   The first installment is $150. Therefore, the remaining amount is:\n   \\[\n   456 - 150 = 306\n   \\]\n   So, the remaining amount to be paid is $306.\n\n4.
