        "To determine how much money Lidia will have left after buying all the apps, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the apps.\n2. Subtract the total cost of the apps from the amount of money Lidia has.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the apps. Since each app costs $4 and Lidia needs 15 apps, we multiply the cost of one app by the number of apps:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ dollars/app} \\times 15 \\text{ apps} = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost of the apps from the amount of money Lidia has. Lidia has $66, so we subtract $60 from $66:\n\\[\n66 \\text{ dollars} - 60 \\text{ dollars} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Lidia will be left with is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
