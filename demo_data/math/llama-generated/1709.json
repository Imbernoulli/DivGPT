        "To determine how many times Sonya fell, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of times Stephanie fell.\n2. Use the number of times Stephanie fell to find out how many times Sonya fell.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many times Stephanie fell. We know that Stephanie had 13 more falls than Steven. Since Steven fell 3 times, we can calculate the number of times Stephanie fell as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of times Stephanie fell} = 3 + 13 = 16\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many times Sonya fell.

Next, we need to find out how many times Sonya fell. We know that Sonya fell down 2 times less than half the number of times Stephanie fell. First, we calculate half the number of times Stephanie fell:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Half the number of times Stephanie fell} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n   \\]\n   Then, we subtract 2 from this result to find out how many times Sonya fell:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of times Sonya fell} = 8 - 2 = 6\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of times Sonya fell is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
