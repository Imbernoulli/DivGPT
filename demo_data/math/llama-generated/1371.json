        "To determine how many calories James loses a week from dancing, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the calories James loses per hour from dancing.\n2. Determine the total number of hours James dances in a week.\n3. Calculate the total calories lost from dancing in a week.\n\nFirst, we know that James loses twice as many calories per hour from dancing as he did when he was walking. Since he burned 300 calories per hour walking, he burns:\n\\[ 2 \\times 300 = 600 \\text{ calories per hour dancing} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours James dances in a week. He dances twice a day for 0.5 hours each time, so he dances:\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.5 = 1 \\text{ hour per day} \\]\nSince he does this 4 times a week, he dances:\n\\[ 1 \\times 4 = 4 \\text{ hours per week} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total calories lost from dancing in a week by multiplying the calories lost per hour by the total number of hours he dances in a week:\n\\[ 600 \\times 4 = 2400 \\text{ calories per week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of calories James loses a week from dancing is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]",

Since he burned 300 calories an hour walking, we have:\n\\[ 2 \\times 300 = 600 \\text{ calories per hour dancing} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of hours James dances in a week.**\n\nJames dances twice a day for 0.5 hours each time. So, the number of hours he dances each day is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.5 = 1 \\text{ hour per day} \\]\n\nSince he does this 4 times a week, the total number of hours he dances in a week is:\n\\[ 1 \\times 4 = 4 \\text{ hours per week} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of calories he loses in a week from dancing.**\n\nNow, we multiply the number of calories he loses per hour dancing by the total number of hours he dances in a week:\n\\[ 600 \\times 4 = 2400 \\text{ calories per week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of calories James loses a week from dancing is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]",
        "To determine how many calories James loses a week from dancing, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of calories James loses per hour from dancing.\n2. Determine the total number of hours James dances in a week.\n3. Multiply the number of calories lost per hour by the total number of hours danced in a week.\n\nFirst, we know that James loses twice as many calories per hour dancing as he did when he was walking. Since he burned 300 calories per hour walking, he loses:\n\\[ 2 \\times 300 = 600 \\text{ calories per hour dancing} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours James dances in a week. He dances twice a day for 0.5 hours each time, so he dances:\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.5 = 1 \\text{ hour per day} \\]\nSince he does this 4 times a week, the total number of hours he dances in a week is:\n\\[ 1 \\times 4 = 4 \\text{ hours per week} \\]\n\nNow, we multiply the number of calories lost per hour by the total number of hours danced in a week to find the total number of calories lost in a week:\n\\[ 600 \\times 4 = 2400 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of calories James loses a week from dancing is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]",
