        "To determine the number of boys who attended the school dance, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of school faculty and staff.\n2. Determine the number of students (excluding faculty and staff).\n3. Calculate the number of girls among the students.\n4. Find the number of boys by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of school faculty and staff:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of faculty and staff} = 10\\% \\text{ of } 100 = 0.10 \\times 100 = 10\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the number of students (excluding faculty and staff):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students} = 100 - \\text{Number of faculty and staff} = 100 - 10 = 90\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the number of girls among the students:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ of } 90 = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 90 = 60\n   \\]\n\n4. Find the number of boys by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of boys} = \\text{Number of students} - \\text{Number of girls} = 90 - 60 = 30\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of boys who attended the school dance is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

Calculate the number of boys.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of school faculty and staff. Since 10 percent of the attendees were faculty and staff, we have:\n\\[\n0.10 \\times 100 = 10\n\\]\nSo, there were 10 faculty and staff.\n\nNext, we determine the number of students by subtracting the number of faculty and staff from the total number of attendees:\n\\[\n100 - 10 = 90\n\\]\nSo, there were 90 students.\n\nOf the remaining attendees (which are all students), two-thirds were girls. Therefore, the number of girls is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 90 = 60\n\\]\nSo, there were 60 girls.\n\nTo find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:\n\\[\n90 - 60 = 30\n\\]\nSo, there were 30 boys.\n\nThus, the number of boys who attended the school dance is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{30}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many boys attended the school dance, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of school faculty and staff:**\n   - There were 100 people in attendance.\n   - Ten percent of the attendees were school faculty and staff.\n   \\[\n   10\\% \\text{ of } 100 = 0.10 \\times 100 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, there were 10 school faculty and staff.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of students:**\n   - Subtract the number of school faculty and staff from the total number of attendees.\n   \\[\n   100 - 10 = 90\n   \\]\n   So, there were 90 students.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of girls:**\n   - Two-thirds of the students were girls.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ of } 90 = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 90 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, there were 60 girls.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of boys:**\n   - Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.\n   \\[\n   90 - 60 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, there were 30 boys.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys who attended the school dance is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
