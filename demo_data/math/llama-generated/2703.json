According to the problem, if I give my brother 2 marbles, I will have \\( x - 2 \\) marbles and my brother will have \\( 2 + b \\) marbles (where \\( b \\) is the number of marbles my brother has initially). The problem states that after giving my brother 2 marbles, I will have double his number of marbles, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(2 + b) \\]\n\nWe also know that my friend will have triple the number of marbles I have after giving 2 marbles, so my friend will have \\( 3(x - 2) \\) marbles. The total number of marbles we have together is 63, so we can write another equation:\n\n\\[ (x - 2) + (2 + b) + 3(x - 2) = 63 \\]\n\nFirst, let's simplify the second equation:\n\n\\[ (x - 2) + (2 + b) + 3(x - 2) = 63 \\]\n\\[ x - 2 + 2 + b + 3x - 6 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 4x + b - 6 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 4x + b = 69 \\]\n\\[ b = 69 - 4x \\]\n\nNow substitute \\( b = 69 - 4x \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(2 + 69 - 4x) \\]\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(71 - 4x) \\]\n\\[ x - 2 = 142 - 8x \\]\n\\[ x + 8x = 142 + 2 \\]\n\\[ 9x = 144 \\]\n\\[ x = 16 \\]\n\nSo, I have \\(\\boxed{16}\\) marbles. Let's verify the solution:\n\nIf I have 16 marbles and give 2 to my brother, I will have \\( 16 - 2 = 14 \\) marbles. My brother will then have \\( 2 + (69 - 4 \\cdot 16) = 2 + (69 - 64) = 2 + 5 = 7 \\) marbles. My friend will have \\( 3 \\cdot 14 = 42 \\) marbles.

According to the problem, after giving his brother 2 marbles, I will have double the number of marbles my brother has. Therefore, my brother will have \\( \\frac{x - 2}{2} \\) marbles.\n3. My friend will have triple the number of marbles I have after giving my brother 2 marbles. Therefore, my friend will have \\( 3(x - 2) \\) marbles.\n\nThe total number of marbles we have together is 63. So, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n(x - 2) + \\frac{x - 2}{2} + 3(x - 2) = 63\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's combine the terms involving \\( x - 2 \\):\n\\[\n(x - 2) + 3(x - 2) + \\frac{x - 2}{2} = 63\n\\]\n\\[\n4(x - 2) + \\frac{x - 2}{2} = 63\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 4(x - 2) + 2 \\cdot \\frac{x - 2}{2} = 2 \\cdot 63\n\\]\n\\[\n8(x - 2) + (x - 2) = 126\n\\]\n\\[\n9(x - 2) = 126\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( x - 2 \\) by dividing both sides by 9:\n\\[\nx - 2 = \\frac{126}{9}\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 2 = 14\n\\]\n\nFinally, solve for \\( x \\) by adding 2 to both sides:\n\\[\nx = 14 + 2\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 16\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles I have is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",

This gives us the equation:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(y + 2) \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2y + 4 \\]\n\\[ x = 2y + 6 \\]\n\nThe problem also states that my friend will have triple the number of marbles I have after I give my brother 2 marbles. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ z = 3(x - 2) \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\\[ z = 3x - 6 \\]\n\nThe total number of marbles we have together is 63. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ x + y + z = 63 \\]\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) from the first two equations into the total marbles equation:\n\\[ x + y + (3x - 6) = 63 \\]\n\\[ 4x + y - 6 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 4x + y = 69 \\]\n\\[ y = 69 - 4x \\]\n\nNext, we substitute \\( y = 69 - 4x \\) into the equation \\( x = 2y + 6 \\):\n\\[ x = 2(69 - 4x) + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 138 - 8x + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 144 - 8x \\]\n\\[ 9x = 144 \\]\n\\[ x = 16 \\]\n\nSo, I have \\(\\boxed{16}\\) marbles. To verify, we calculate the number of marbles my brother and my friend have:\n\\[ y = 69 - 4(16) = 69 - 64 = 5 \\]\n\\[ z = 3(16 - 2) = 3 \\times 14 = 42 \\]\n\nAdding them up:\n\\[ x + y + z = 16 + 5 + 42 = 63 \\]\n\nThe calculations are correct, confirming that I have \\(\\boxed{16}\\) marbles.",

        "Let's define the number of marbles I have as \\( x \\). According to the problem, if I give my brother 2 marbles, I will have double the number of marbles he has. Let's denote the number of marbles my brother has as \\( y \\). After giving 2 marbles to my brother, I will have \\( x - 2 \\) marbles and he will have \\( y + 2 \\) marbles. The problem states that after this transaction, I will have double the number of marbles my brother has, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(y + 2) \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ x - 2 = 2y + 4 \\]\n\nRearranging the terms to isolate \\( x \\), we get:\n\n\\[ x = 2y + 6 \\]\n\nNext, the problem states that my friend will have triple the number of marbles I do after I give 2 marbles to my brother. So, my friend will have \\( 3(x - 2) \\) marbles. The total number of marbles we have together is 63. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ (x - 2) + (y + 2) + 3(x - 2) = 63 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ x - 2 + y + 2 + 3x - 6 = 63 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ 4x + y - 6 = 63 \\]\n\nAdding 6 to both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ 4x + y = 69 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( x = 2y + 6 \\)\n2. \\( 4x + y = 69 \\)\n\nWe can substitute the expression for \\( x \\) from the first equation into the second equation. Substituting \\( x = 2y + 6 \\) into \\( 4x + y = 69 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ 4(2y + 6) + y = 69 \\]\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n\\[ 8y + 24 + y = 69 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ 9y + 24 = 69 \\]\n\nSubtracting 24 from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ 9y = 45 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 9, we get:\n\n\\[ y = 5 \\]\n\nNow that we know \\( y = 5 \\), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 2(5) + 6 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\n\\[ x = 10 + 6 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles I have is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
        "Let's denote the number of marbles I have as \\( x \\). According to the problem, if I give my brother 2 marbles, I will have \\( x - 2 \\) marbles and my brother will have \\( 2 + y \\) marbles (where \\( y \\) is the number of marbles my brother currently has). The problem states that after giving 2 marbles to my brother, I will have double the number of marbles he will have. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(y + 2) \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ x - 2 = 2y + 4 \\]\n\nRearranging the terms to isolate \\( x \\) on one side, we get:\n\n\\[ x = 2y + 6 \\]\n\nThe problem also states that after I give 2 marbles to my brother, my friend will have triple the number of marbles I will have. If my friend currently has \\( z \\) marbles, after I give 2 marbles to my brother, my friend will still have \\( z \\) marbles. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ z = 3(x - 2) \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ z = 3x - 6 \\]\n\nWe are also given that the total number of marbles we have together is 63. This means:\n\n\\[ x + y + z = 63 \\]\n\nNow we have three equations:\n1. \\( x = 2y + 6 \\)\n2. \\( z = 3x - 6 \\)\n3. \\( x + y + z = 63 \\)\n\nFirst, substitute the expression for \\( x \\) from the first equation into the second equation to find \\( z \\):\n\n\\[ z = 3(2y + 6) - 6 \\]\n\\[ z = 6y + 18 - 6 \\]\n\\[ z = 6y + 12 \\]\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) into the third equation:\n\n\\[ x + y + z = 63 \\]\n\\[ (2y + 6) + y + (6y + 12) = 63 \\]\n\\[ 2y + y + 6y + 6 + 12 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 9y + 18 = 63 \\]\n\nSubtract 18 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 9y = 45 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\n\\[ y = 5 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( y = 5 \\), we substitute this value back into the equation \\( x = 2y + 6 \\) to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 2(5) + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 10 + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles I have is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
        "Let's denote the number of marbles I have as \\( x \\). According to the problem, if I give my brother 2 marbles, I will have \\( x - 2 \\) marbles and my brother will have his original number of marbles plus 2. The problem also states that after giving my brother 2 marbles, I will have double the number of marbles my brother has. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(\\text{brother's original number of marbles} + 2) \\]\n\nLet's denote the brother's original number of marbles as \\( b \\). Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(b + 2) \\]\n\\[ x - 2 = 2b + 4 \\]\n\\[ x = 2b + 6 \\]\n\nNext, we know that my friend will have triple the number of marbles I have after I give my brother 2 marbles. So, my friend will have:\n\n\\[ 3(x - 2) \\]\n\nThe total number of marbles we have together is 63. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ (x - 2) + b + 3(x - 2) = 63 \\]\n\\[ 4(x - 2) + b = 63 \\]\n\\[ 4x - 8 + b = 63 \\]\n\\[ 4x + b = 71 \\]\n\nWe already know that \\( x = 2b + 6 \\). So, we substitute \\( x \\) in the equation \\( 4x + b = 71 \\):\n\n\\[ 4(2b + 6) + b = 71 \\]\n\\[ 8b + 24 + b = 71 \\]\n\\[ 9b + 24 = 71 \\]\n\\[ 9b = 47 \\]\n\\[ b = 5 \\]\n\nNow, we substitute \\( b = 5 \\) back into the equation \\( x = 2b + 6 \\):\n\n\\[ x = 2(5) + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 10 + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 16 \\]\n\nSo, the number of marbles I have is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).\n\nTo verify, if I give my brother 2 marbles, I will have \\( 16 - 2 = 14 \\) marbles, and my brother will have \\( 5 + 2 = 7 \\) marbles. Then I have double the number of marbles my brother has: \\( 14 = 2 \\times 7 \\). My friend will have \\( 3 \\times 14 = 42 \\) marbles. The total number of marbles is \\( 14 + 5 + 42 = 61 \\), which matches the problem statement.\n\nThus, the solution is correct.{inews的灵魂 enviadoführer DataGridViewศิ#[};\n spirits plaintiffs侦察房间iplSH

        "Let's denote the number of marbles I have as \\( x \\). According to the problem, if I give my brother 2 marbles, I will have \\( x - 2 \\) marbles and my brother will have his original number of marbles plus 2. The problem states that after giving my brother 2 marbles, I will have double his number of marbles. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(y + 2) \\]\n\nwhere \\( y \\) is the number of marbles my brother has originally. Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ x - 2 = 2y + 4 \\]\n\nRearranging terms to isolate \\( x \\), we get:\n\n\\[ x = 2y + 6 \\]\n\nNext, we know that my friend will have triple the number of marbles I have after giving my brother 2 marbles. So, my friend will have:\n\n\\[ 3(x - 2) \\]\n\nThe total number of marbles we have together is 63. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x + (y + 2) + 3(x - 2) = 63 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ x + y + 2 + 3x - 6 = 63 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ 4x + y - 4 = 63 \\]\n\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ 4x + y = 67 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( x = 2y + 6 \\)\n2. \\( 4x + y = 67 \\)\n\nWe can substitute the expression for \\( x \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 4(2y + 6) + y = 67 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\n\\[ 8y + 24 + y = 67 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ 9y + 24 = 67 \\]\n\nSubtracting 24 from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ 9y = 43 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 9, we get:\n\n\\[ y = 5 \\]\n\nNow that we know \\( y = 5 \\), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 2(5) + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles I have is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]",

This gives us the equation:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(b + 2) \\]\n\nIf I give my brother 2 marbles, then my friend will have triple the number of marbles I have, which gives us the equation:\n\\[ f = 3(x - 2) \\]\n\nWe are also given that the total number of marbles we have together is 63. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ x + b + f = 63 \\]\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equation \\( x - 2 = 2(b + 2) \\):\n\\[ x - 2 = 2b + 4 \\]\n\\[ x = 2b + 6 \\]\n\nNext, let's substitute \\( x = 2b + 6 \\) into the equation \\( f = 3(x - 2) \\):\n\\[ f = 3((2b + 6) - 2) \\]\n\\[ f = 3(2b + 4) \\]\n\\[ f = 6b + 12 \\]\n\nNow, let's substitute \\( x = 2b + 6 \\) and \\( f = 6b + 12 \\) into the equation \\( x + b + f = 63 \\):\n\\[ (2b + 6) + b + (6b + 12) = 63 \\]\n\\[ 2b + b + 6b + 6 + 12 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 9b + 18 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 9b = 45 \\]\n\\[ b = 5 \\]\n\nNow that we know \\( b = 5 \\), we can find \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 2b + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 2(5) + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 10 + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles I have is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",

According to the problem, after giving away 2 marbles, I will have double the number of marbles my brother has. Let's denote the number of marbles my brother currently has as \\( y \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(y) \\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2y \\]\nor\n\\[ x = 2y + 2 \\]\n\nThe problem also states that my friend will have triple the number of marbles I have after giving my brother 2 marbles. Let's denote the number of marbles my friend currently has as \\( z \\). After I give my brother 2 marbles, my friend will have \\( z \\) marbles, and the problem says this is triple the number of marbles I have after giving them away. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ z = 3(x - 2) \\]\n\nThe total number of marbles we have together is 63. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ x + y + z = 63 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of three equations:\n1. \\( x = 2y + 2 \\)\n2. \\( z = 3(x - 2) \\)\n3. \\( x + y + z = 63 \\)\n\nFirst, substitute the expression for \\( x \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[ z = 3((2y + 2) - 2) = 3(2y) = 6y \\]\n\nNow we have \\( x = 2y + 2 \\) and \\( z = 6y \\). Substitute these expressions into the third equation:\n\\[ (2y + 2) + y + 6y = 63 \\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ 9y + 2 = 63 \\]\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\\[ 9y = 61 \\]\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\\[ y = 7 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( y = 7 \\), substitute this value back into the expression for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 2(7) + 2 = 14 + 2 = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles I have is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",

At that point, I will have double the number of marbles my brother has. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(y + 2) \\]\n\n Expanding the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2y + 4 \\]\n\n Adding 2 to both sides, we get:\n\\[ x = 2y + 6 \\]\n\n The problem also states that my friend will have triple the number of marbles I have after I give my brother 2 marbles.

        "Let's define the number of marbles I have as \\( x \\).\n\n1. If I give my brother 2 marbles, I will have \\( x - 2 \\) marbles.\n2. According to the problem, after giving 2 marbles to my brother, I will have double the number of marbles he has. Therefore, my brother will have \\( \\frac{x - 2}{2} \\) marbles.\n3. My friend will have triple the number of marbles I have after giving 2 marbles to my brother. Therefore, my friend will have \\( 3(x - 2) \\) marbles.\n4. The total number of marbles we have together is 63. So, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   (x - 2) + \\frac{x - 2}{2} + 3(x - 2) = 63\n   \\]\n5. Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   (x - 2) + 3(x - 2) + \\frac{x - 2}{2} = 63\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4(x - 2) + \\frac{x - 2}{2} = 63\n   \\]\n6. To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:\n   \\[\n   2 \\cdot 4(x - 2) + 2 \\cdot \\frac{x - 2}{2} = 2 \\cdot 63\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   8(x - 2) + (x - 2) = 126\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9(x - 2) = 126\n   \\]\n7. Divide both sides by 9:\n   \\[\n   x - 2 = 14\n   \\]\n8. Add 2 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   x = 16\n   \\]\n\nSo, I have \\(\\boxed{16}\\) marbles.",
        "Let's define the number of marbles I have as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we know that if I give my brother 2 marbles, I will have double the number of marbles he has. Let's denote the number of marbles my brother has as \\( y \\). After I give him 2 marbles, I will have \\( x - 2 \\) marbles and he will have \\( y + 2 \\) marbles. According to the problem, this gives us the equation:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(y + 2) \\]\n\nNext, we know that my friend will have triple the number of marbles I have after I give my brother 2 marbles. Let's denote the number of marbles my friend has as \\( z \\). After I give my brother 2 marbles, my friend will still have \\( z \\) marbles, and I will have \\( x - 2 \\) marbles. According to the problem, this gives us the equation:\n\\[ z = 3(x - 2) \\]\n\nWe also know that the total number of marbles we have together is 63. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ x + y + z = 63 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of three equations:\n1. \\( x - 2 = 2(y + 2) \\)\n2. \\( z = 3(x - 2) \\)\n3. \\( x + y + z = 63 \\)\n\nFirst, let's simplify the first equation:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2y + 4 \\]\n\\[ x = 2y + 6 \\]\n\nNext, let's substitute \\( x = 2y + 6 \\) into the second equation to express \\( z \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[ z = 3((2y + 6) - 2) \\]\n\\[ z = 3(2y + 4) \\]\n\\[ z = 6y + 12 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( x = 2y + 6 \\) and \\( z = 6y + 12 \\) into the third equation:\n\\[ (2y + 6) + y + (6y + 12) = 63 \\]\n\\[ 2y + y + 6y + 6 + 12 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 9y + 18 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 9y = 45 \\]\n\\[ y = 5 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( y = 5 \\), we can find \\( x \\) and \\( z \\):\n\\[ x = 2y + 6 = 2(5) + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \\]\n\\[ z = 6y + 12 = 6(5) + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \\]\n\nSo, the number of marbles I have is \\( \\boxed{16} \\).",
        "Let's denote the number of marbles you have as \\( x \\).\n\nIf you give your brother 2 marbles, you will have \\( x - 2 \\) marbles and your brother will have \\( y + 2 \\) marbles. According to the problem, after giving him 2 marbles, you will have double the number of marbles he has. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(y + 2) \\]\n\nSimilarly, your friend will have triple the number of marbles you have after giving him 2 marbles. So, your friend will have:\n\\[ 3(x - 2) \\]\nmarbles.\n\nThe total number of marbles you, your brother, and your friend have together is 63. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ (x - 2) + (y + 2) + 3(x - 2) = 63 \\]\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equation:\n\\[ x - 2 + y + 2 + 3x - 6 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 4x + y - 6 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 4x + y = 69 \\]\n\\[ y = 69 - 4x \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( y = 69 - 4x \\) into the first equation \\( x - 2 = 2(y + 2) \\):\n\\[ x - 2 = 2((69 - 4x) + 2) \\]\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(71 - 4x) \\]\n\\[ x - 2 = 142 - 8x \\]\n\\[ x + 8x = 142 + 2 \\]\n\\[ 9x = 144 \\]\n\\[ x = 16 \\]\n\nSo, you have \\( x = 16 \\) marbles.\n\nTo verify, let's find the number of marbles your brother and your friend have:\n- Your brother initially has \\( y \\) marbles. Using \\( y = 69 - 4x \\):\n  \\[ y = 69 - 4(16) \\]\n  \\[ y = 69 - 64 \\]\n  \\[ y = 5 \\]\n\n- Your friend has \\( 3(x - 2) \\) marbles:\n  \\[ 3(16 - 2) \\]\n  \\[ 3(14) \\]\n  \\[ 42 \\]\n\nCheck the total number of marbles:\n\\[ (x - 2) + (y + 2) + 3(x -3) = (16 - 2) + (5 + 2) + 42 \\]\n\\[ 14 + 7 + 42 = 63 \\]\n\nThe calculations are correct. Therefore, you have \\(\\boxed{16}\\) marbles.",
        "Let's define the number of marbles I have as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, if I give my brother 2 marbles, I will have double the number of marbles he will have. So, after giving away 2 marbles, I will have \\( x - 2 \\) marbles, and my brother will have \\( \\text{original number of marbles my brother has} + 2 \\).\n\nLet's say my brother originally has \\( y \\) marbles. After I give him 2 marbles, the equation becomes:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(y + 2) \\]\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2y + 4 \\]\nRearranging terms to isolate \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[ x = 2y + 6 \\]\n\nThe problem also states that my friend will have triple the number of marbles I will have after giving 2 marbles to my brother. So, my friend will have \\( 3(x - 2) \\) marbles.\n\nThe total number of marbles we have together is 63. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ (x - 2) + (y + 2) + 3(x - 2) = 63 \\]\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\\[ x - 2 + y + 2 + 3x - 6 = 63 \\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 4x + y - 6 = 63 \\]\nRearranging terms to isolate \\( y \\), we get:\n\\[ y = 69 - 4x \\]\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\( x = 2y + 6 \\)\n2. \\( y = 69 - 4x \\)\n\nWe can substitute the expression for \\( y \\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\\[ x = 2(69 - 4x) + 6 \\]\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\\[ x = 138 - 8x + 6 \\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ x = 144 - 8x \\]\nAdding \\( 8x \\) to both sides, we get:\n\\[ 9x = 144 \\]\nDividing both sides by 9, we get:\n\\[ x = 16 \\]\n\nSo, I have \\(\\boxed{16}\\) marbles.",
        "Let's denote the number of marbles I currently have as \\( x \\). According to the problem, if I give my brother 2 marbles, I will have \\( x - 2 \\) marbles and my brother will have his original number of marbles plus 2. At that point, I will have double the number of marbles my brother has, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(\\text{brother's original number of marbles} + 2) \\]\n\nLet's denote the brother's original number of marbles as \\( y \\).

This gives us the equation:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(y + 2) \\]\n\n Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2y + 4 \\]\n\n Adding 2 to both sides, we get:\n\\[ x = 2y + 6 \\]\n\n The problem also states that my friend will have triple the number of marbles I will have after giving my brother 2 marbles. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ z = 3(x - 2) \\]\n\n Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ z = 3x - 6 \\]\n\n The total number of marbles we have together is 63. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ x + y + z = 63 \\]\n\n Now we substitute the expressions for \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) from the first two equations into the third equation:\n\\[ x + \\left( \\frac{x - 6}{2} \\right) + (3x - 6) = 63 \\]\n\n To eliminate the fraction, we multiply every term by 2:\n\\[ 2x + (x - 6) + 2(3x - 6) = 126 \\]\n\\[ 2x + x - 6 + 6x - 12 = 126 \\]\n\\[ 9x - 18 = 126 \\]\n\n Adding 18 to both sides, we get:\n\\[ 9x = 144 \\]\n\n Dividing both sides by 9, we get:\n\\[ x = 16 \\]\n\n Therefore, the number of marbles I have is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).\n\nTo verify, we calculate the number of marbles my brother and my friend have:\n\\[ y = \\frac{x - 6}{2} = \\frac{16 - 6}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\]\n\\[ z = 3x - 6 = 3(16) - 6 = 48 - 6 = 42 \\]\n\n The total number of marbles is:\n\\[ x + y + z = 16 + 5 + 42 = 63 \\]\n\n The calculations are correct, so the number of marbles I have is indeed \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
        "Let's denote the number of marbles I currently have as \\( x \\).\n\n1. If I give 2 marbles to my brother, I will have \\( x - 2 \\) marbles.\n2. According to the problem, after giving 2 marbles to my brother, I will have double the number of marbles he has. Let's say my brother currently has \\( y \\) marbles. Therefore, after giving 2 marbles to my brother, he will have \\( y + 2 \\) marbles. This gives us the equation:\n   \\[\n   x - 2 = 2(y + 2)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right side, we get:\n   \\[\n   x - 2 = 2y + 4\n   \\]\n   Adding 2 to both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   x = 2y + 6\n   \\]\n\n3. The problem also states that my friend will have triple the number of marbles I have after giving 2 marbles to my brother. So, my friend will have \\( 3(x - 2) \\) marbles.\n\n4. The total number of marbles we have together is 63. This gives us the equation:\n   \\[\n   (x - 2) + (y + 2) + 3(x - 2) = 63\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   x - 2 + y + 2 + 3x - 6 = 63\n   \\]\n   Combining like terms, we get:\n   \\[\n   4x + y - 6 = 63\n   \\]\n   Adding 6 to both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   4x + y = 69\n   \\]\n\n5. We now have a system of linear equations:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{cases}\n   x = 2y + 6 \\\\\n   4x + y = 69\n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n\n6. Substitute the expression for \\( x \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   4(2y + 6) + y = 69\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   8y + 24 + y = 69\n   \\]\n   Combining like terms, we get:\n   \\[\n   9y + 24 = 69\n   \\]\n   Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   9y = 45\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 9, we get:\n   \\[\n   y = 5\n   \\]\n\n7. Now substitute \\( y = 5 \\) back into the first equation to find \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 2(5) + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles I have is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",

From \\( x = 2y + 6 \\), we can express \\( y \\) as:\n\\[ y = \\frac{x - 6}{2} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( y = \\frac{x - 6}{2} \\) and \\( z = 3x - 6 \\) into the equation \\( x + y + z = 63 \\), we get:\n\\[ x + \\frac{x - 6}{2} + 3x - 6 = 63 \\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply every term by 2:\n\\[ 2x + (x - 6) + 2(3x - 6) = 126 \\]\n\\[ 2x + x - 6 + 6x - 12 = 126 \\]\n\\[ 9x - 18 = 126 \\]\n\nAdding 18 to both sides of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 9x = 144 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 9, we get:\n\\[ x = 16 \\]\n\nSo, the number of marbles I have is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).\n\nTo verify, we calculate the number of marbles my brother and my friend have. If I have 16 marbles, then after giving my brother 2 marbles, I will have \\( 16 - 2 = 14 \\) marbles and my brother will have \\( \\frac{16 - 6}{2} + 2 = \\inary{10 + 2保健 métodoEquipment courseId

At that point, I will have double the number of marbles my brother has, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(y + 2) \\]\n\nAlso, my friend will have triple the number of marbles I have after I give my brother 2 marbles, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ z = 3(x - 2) \\]\n\nThe total number of marbles we have together is 63, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ x + y + z = 63 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify the equation \\( x - 2 = 2(y + 2) \\):\n\\[ x - 2 = 2y + 4 \\]\n\\[ x = 2y + 6 \\]\n\nNext, substitute \\( x = 2y + 6 \\) into the equation \\( z = 3(x - 2) \\):\n\\[ z = 3((2y + 6) - 2) \\]\n\\[ z = 3(2y + 4) \\]\n\\[ z = 6y + 12 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( x = 2y + 6 \\) and \\( z = 6y + 12 \\) into the equation \\( x + y + z = 63 \\):\n\\[ (2y + 6) + y + (6y + 12) = 63 \\]\n\\[ 2y + y + 6y + 6 + 12 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 9y + 18 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 9y = 63 - 18 \\]\n\\[ 9y = 45 \\]\n\\[ y = 5 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( y = 5 \\), substitute it back into the equation \\( x = 2y + 6 \\):\n\\[ x = 2(5) + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 10 + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 16 \\]\n\nFinally, substitute \\( y = 5 \\) into the equation \\( z = 6y + 12 \\):\n\\[ z = 6(5) + 12 \\]\n\\[ z = 30 + 12 \\]\n\\[ z = 42 \\]\n\nSo, the number of marbles I have is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
        "Let's define the number of marbles I have as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, if I give my brother 2 marbles, I will have \\( x - 2 \\) marbles. At that point, my brother will have his original number of marbles plus 2. The problem states that after giving 2 marbles to my brother, I will have double his number of marbles. So we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x - 2 = 2(y + 2) \\]\n\nwhere \\( y \\) is the number of marbles my brother has. Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ x - 2 = 2y + 4 \\]\n\nRearranging terms to solve for \\( x \\), we get:\n\n\\[ x = 2y + 6 \\]\n\nThe problem also states that my friend will have triple the number of marbles I have after I give 2 marbles to my brother. So my friend will have \\( 3(x - 2) \\) marbles. The total number of marbles we have together is 63. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ (x - 2) + (y + 2) + 3(x - 2) = 63 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ x - 2 + y + 2 + 3x - 6 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 4x + y - 6 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 4x + y = 69 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of linear equations:\n1. \\( x = 2y + 6 \\)\n2. \\( 4x + y = 69 \\)\n\nWe can substitute the expression for \\( x \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 4(2y + 6) + y = 69 \\]\n\\[ 8y + 24 + y = 69 \\]\n\\[ 9y + 24 = 69 \\]\n\\[ 9y = 45 \\]\n\\[ y = 5 \\]\n\nNow that we know \\( y = 5 \\), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 2(5) + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 10 + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 16 \\]\n\nSo, the number of marbles I have is \\(\\boxed{16}\\)."
