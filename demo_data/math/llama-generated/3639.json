        "To find the average class size, we need to determine the number of students in each class and then calculate the average of these class sizes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of students in the class for the 3 and 4-year-olds:\n- There are 13 3-year-olds.\n- There are 20 4-year-olds.\n- Therefore, the total number of students in the 3 and 4-year-olds class is \\(13 + 20 = 33\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of students in the class for the 5 and 6-year-olds:\n- There are 15 5-year-olds.\n- There are 22 6-year-olds.\n- Therefore, the total number of students in the 5 and 6-year-olds class is \\(15 + 22 = 37\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the average class size. The average class size is the sum of the class sizes divided by the number of classes:\n- The sum of the class sizes is \\(33 + 37 = 70\\).\n- The number of classes is 2.\n- Therefore, the average class size is \\(\\frac{70}{2} = 35\\).\n\nThe average class size is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",
