        "To determine the cost of the pair of socks, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial amount of money George had, which is $100.\n2. Subtract the cost of the shirt, which is $24, from the initial amount.\n3. Subtract the cost of the pair of socks from the remaining amount after buying the shirt.\n4. We know that after buying both the shirt and the pair of socks, George had $65 left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of the pair of socks:\n\n\\[\n100 - 24 - \\text{cost of socks} = 65\n\\]\n\n5. Simplify the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n76 - \\text{cost of socks} = 65\n\\]\n\n6. To isolate the cost of the socks, subtract 65 from 76:\n\n\\[\n\\text{cost of socks} = 76 - 65\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{cost of socks} = 11\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the pair of socks is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
