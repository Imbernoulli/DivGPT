        "To determine how long it will take 15 pugs to clean their house, we start by finding the cleaning rate of the pugs. We know that four pugs can clean the house in 45 minutes. Therefore, the total work done by the four pugs in 45 minutes is equivalent to cleaning one house. We can express the work rate of the pugs in terms of houses per minute:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Work rate of 4 pugs} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{45 \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]\n\nThe work rate of one pug is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Work rate of 1 pug} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{45 \\text{ minutes} \\times 4} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{180 \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the work rate of 15 pugs. Since the work rate of one pug is \\(\\frac{1}{180}\\) houses per minute, the work rate of 15 pugs is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Work rate of 15 pugs} = 15 \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{180 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{15 \\text{ houses}}{180 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{12 \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]\n\nThis means that 15 pugs can clean one house in 12 minutes.

        "To determine how long it will take 15 pugs to clean their house, we start by finding out how long it takes one pug to clean the house alone. Since four pugs can clean the house in 45 minutes, the time it takes one pug to clean the house is:\n\n\\[ 45 \\text{ minutes} \\times 4 = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThis means that one pug takes 180 minutes to clean the house alone. Therefore, the work rate of one pug is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{180 \\text{ minutes}} \\]\n\nIf we have 15 pugs working together, their combined work rate is:\n\n\\[ 15 \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{180 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{15 \\text{ houses}}{180 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{12 \\text{ minutes}} \\]\n\nThis means that 15 pugs can clean one house in 12 minutes.

        "To determine how long it will take for 15 pugs to clean their house, we start by finding the cleaning rate of the pugs. We know that four pugs can clean the house in 45 minutes. Therefore, the total work done by the four pugs in 45 minutes is equivalent to cleaning one house.\n\nFirst, we calculate the work rate of one pug. Since four pugs clean the house in 45 minutes, one pug will clean \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the house in 45 minutes. So, the work rate of one pug is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Work rate of one pug} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{4 \\text{ pugs} \\times 45 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{180 \\text{ pug-minutes}}\n\\]\n\nThis means that one pug can clean \\(\\frac{1}{180}\\) of the house per minute. Now, we need to find out the combined work rate of 15 pugs. Since each pug works at a rate of \\(\\frac{1}{180}\\) of the house per minute, 15 pugs will work at a rate of:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Combined work rate of 15 pugs} = 15 \\times \\frac{1}{180} = \\frac{15}{180} = \\frac{1}{12} \\text{ of the house per minute}\n\\]\n\nThis means that 15 pugs can clean \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) of the house per minute. To find out how many minutes it will take for 15 pugs to clean the entire house, we take the reciprocal of their combined work rate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time taken by 15 pugs to clean the house} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{\\frac{1}{12} \\text{ of the house per minute}} = 12 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 15 pugs \\(\\boxed{12}\\) minutes to clean their house.",

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 15 pugs to clean the house. If 15 pugs work together, the total pug-minutes worked will still be 180. So, the time it takes for 15 pugs to clean the house is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{180 \\text{ pug-minutes}}{15 \\text{ pugs}} = 12 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 15 pugs \\(\\boxed{12}\\) minutes to clean their house.",

Therefore, the total work done by the four pugs in 45 minutes is equivalent to cleaning one house.\n\nFirst, we calculate the work rate of one pug.

So, one pug's work rate is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Work rate of one pug} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{4 \\text{ pugs} \\times 45 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{180 \\text{ pug-minutes}}\n\\]\n\nThis means that one pug can clean \\(\\frac{1}{180}\\) of the house per minute.

        "To determine how many minutes it will take for 15 pugs to clean their house, we start by finding out the cleaning rate of the pugs. We know that four pugs can clean the house in 45 minutes. Therefore, the total work done by four pugs in 45 minutes is equal to cleaning one house. We can express this work rate in terms of pug-minutes:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{ pugs} \\times 45 \\text{ minutes} = 180 \\text{ pug-minutes} \\]\n\nThis tells us that it takes 180 pug-minutes to clean one house. Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for 15 pugs to do the same amount of work (180 pug-minutes). Let \\( t \\) be the number of minutes it takes for 15 pugs to clean the house. Then we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 15 \\text{ pugs} \\times t \\text{ minutes} = 180 \\text{ pug-minutes} \\]\n\nTo find \\( t \\), we solve for \\( t \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 15:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{180 \\text{ pug-minutes}}{15 \\text{ pugs}} = 12 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 15 pugs working together \\(\\boxed{12}\\) minutes to clean their house.",

Therefore, the total work done by the four pugs in 45 minutes is equivalent to cleaning one house.\n\nFirst, we calculate the work rate of one pug. Since four pugs clean one house in 45 minutes, one pug will clean \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the house in 45 minutes. Thus, the work rate of one pug is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Work rate of one pug} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{4 \\text{ pugs} \\times 45 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1}{180} \\text{ houses per minute per pug}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the work rate of 15 pugs. Since each pug works at a rate of \\(\\frac{1}{180}\\) houses per minute, 15 pugs will work at a rate of:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Work rate of 15 pugs} = 15 \\times \\frac{1}{180} = \\frac{15}{180} = \\frac{1}{12} \\text{ houses per minute}\n\\]\n\nThis means that 15 pugs can clean \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) of the house in one minute. To find out how many minutes it will take for 15 pugs to clean one whole house, we take the reciprocal of their work rate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time for 15 pugs to clean one house} = \\frac{1 \\text{ house}}{\\frac{1}{12} \\text{ houses per minute}} = 12 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 15 pugs \\(\\boxed{12}\\) minutes to clean their house.",
        "To determine how long it will take 15 pugs to clean their house, we start by finding out how long it takes one pug to clean the house on its own.\n\nFirst, we know that four pugs can clean the house in 45 minutes. Therefore, the total amount of work done by the four pugs in 45 minutes is equivalent to cleaning one house. We can express this work in terms of \"pug-minutes\" (the number of pugs multiplied by the number of minutes they work).\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ pugs} \\times 45 \\text{ minutes} = 180 \\text{ pug-minutes}\n\\]\n\nThis tells us that it takes 180 pug-minutes to clean one house. Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for 15 pugs to complete the same amount of work (180 pug-minutes).\n\nLet \\( t \\) be the time in minutes it takes for 15 pugs to clean the house. Then, the total amount of work done by 15 pugs in \\( t \\) minutes is:\n\n\\[\n15 \\text{ pugs} \\times t \\text{ minutes} = 180 \\text{ pug-minutes}\n\\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( t \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 15:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{180 \\text{ pug-minutes}}{15 \\text{ pugs}} = 12 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 15 pugs working together \\(\\boxed{12}\\) minutes to clean their house.",
