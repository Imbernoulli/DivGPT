        "To determine how many minutes more Kwame and Connor studied than Lexia, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the study times of Kwame and Connor from hours to minutes.\n2. Add the study times of Kwame and Connor.\n3. Subtract Lexia's study time from the total study time of Kwame and Connor.\n\nFirst, let's convert the study times from hours to minutes:\n- Kwame studied for 2.5 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 2.5 by 60:\n  \\[\n  2.5 \\times 60 = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n- Connor studied for 1.5 hours. Similarly, we multiply 1.5 by 60:\n  \\[\n  1.5 \\times 60 = 90 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we add the study times of Kwame and Connor:\n\\[\n150 + 90 = 240 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract Lexia's study time from the total study time of Kwame and Connor:\n- Lexia studied for 97 minutes. So, we subtract 97 from 240:\n  \\[\n  240 - 97 = 143 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, Kwame and Connor studied \\(\\boxed{143}\\) minutes more than Lexia.",
