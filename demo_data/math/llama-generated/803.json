        "To determine the total number of math questions completed by Fiona, Shirley, and Kiana in 2 hours, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of questions each girl completed in one hour:**\n   - Fiona completed 36 questions.\n   - Shirley completed twice as many questions as Fiona:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 36 = 72\n     \\]\n   - Kiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's questions:\n     \\[\n     36 + 72 = 108\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{108}{2} = 54\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of questions completed by all three girls in one hour:**\n   - Fiona: 36 questions\n   - Shirley: 72 questions\n   - Kiana: 54 questions\n   \\[\n   36 + 72 + 54 = 162\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of questions completed by all three girls in two hours:**\n   - Since they each did the same number of questions in the second hour, we multiply the total for one hour by 2:\n     \\[\n     162 \\times 2 = 324\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of math questions completed by Fiona, Shirley, and Kiana in 2 hours is \\(\\boxed{324}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of math questions completed by Fiona, Shirley, and Kiana in 2 hours, we start by calculating the number of questions each girl completed in one hour.\n\nFirst, we know that Fiona completed 36 math questions in one hour. Therefore, in two hours, Fiona completes:\n\\[ 36 \\times 2 = 72 \\text{ questions} \\]\n\nNext, Shirley completed twice as many math questions as Fiona in one hour. So, Shirley completed:\n\\[ 2 \\times 36 = 72 \\text{ questions} \\]\nIn two hours, Shirley completes:\n\\[ 72 \\times 2 = 144 \\text{ questions} \\]\n\nKiana completed half of the sum of Fiona and Shirley's math questions in one hour.
