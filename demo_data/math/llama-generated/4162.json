        "To determine Owen's profit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the face masks.\n2. Determine the revenue from selling the repacked boxes.\n3.

He sold these remaining 300 face masks in baggies at the rate of 10 pieces of mask for $3. First, we find out how many sets of 10 pieces are in 300 face masks:\n\\[\n300 \\div 10 = 30\n\\]\nThen, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 300 face masks:\n\\[\n30 \\times 3 = 90\n\\]\nSo, the revenue from selling the remaining face masks is $90.\n\nNow, we add the revenue from selling the repacked face masks and the remaining face masks to find the total revenue:\n\\[\n60 + 90 = 150\n\\]\nSo, the total revenue is $150.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:\n\\[\n150 - 108 = 42\n\\]\nSo, the profit Owen made is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{42}\n\\]",
        "To determine Owen's profit, we need to calculate both his total cost and his total revenue, then find the difference between the two.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the face masks.**\nOwen bought 12 boxes of face masks at $9 per box.\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 12 \\times 9 = 108 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from repacking and selling the first 6 boxes.**\nEach box contains 50 face masks, so 6 boxes contain:\n\\[\n6 \\times 50 = 300 \\text{ face masks}\n\\]\nOwen repacked these 300 face masks and sold them for $5 per 25 pieces. The number of 25-piece packs in 300 face masks is:\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{25} = 12 \\text{ packs}\n\\]\nThe revenue from selling these packs is:\n\\[\n12 \\times 5 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining face masks.**\nAfter repacking 6 boxes, Owen has:\n\\[\n12 - 6 = 6 \\text{ boxes} \\text{ remaining}\n\\]\nEach box contains 50 face masks, so 6 boxes contain:\n\\[\n6 \\times 50 = 300 \\text{ face masks}\n\\]\nOwen sold these 300 face masks at the rate of 10 pieces of mask for $3. The number of 10-piece packs in 300 face masks is:\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{10} = 30 \\text{ packs}\n\\]\nThe revenue from selling these packs is:\n\\[\n30 \\times 3 = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from all sales.**\nThe total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the first 6 boxes and the remaining 6 boxes:\n\\[\n60 + 90 = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the profit.**\nThe profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:\n\\[\n150 - 108 = 42 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, Owen's profit is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{42}\n\\]"
