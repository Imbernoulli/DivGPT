        "To determine how many trips Jill will make before the tank is filled, we need to calculate the combined rate at which Jack and Jill fill the tank.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of water each person carries per trip:\n- Jack carries 2 buckets per trip, and each bucket is 5 gallons. Therefore, Jack carries \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) gallons per trip.\n- Jill carries 1 bucket per trip, and each bucket is 5 gallons. Therefore, Jill carries \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) gallons per trip.\n\nNext, we need to determine the ratio of the number of trips Jack makes to the number of trips Jill makes. According to the problem, Jack can complete 3 trips in the time it takes Jill to complete 2 trips. This means Jack's rate of trips is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) times Jill's rate of trips.\n\nLet's denote the number of trips Jill makes by \\(x\\). Then, the number of trips Jack makes is \\(\\frac{3}{2}x\\).\n\nNow, we calculate the total amount of water carried by both Jack and Jill in \\(x\\) trips by Jill:\n- The total water carried by Jill is \\(5x\\) gallons.\n- The total water carried by Jack is \\(10 \\times \\frac{3}{2}x = 15x\\) gallons.\n\nThe combined total amount of water carried by both Jack and Jill is \\(5x + 15x = 20x\\) gallons.\n\nWe know the tank has a capacity of 600 gallons, so we set up the equation:\n\\[\n20x = 600\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 20:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{600}{20} = 30\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jill will make \\(\\boxed{30}\\) trips before the tank is filled.",
        "To determine how many trips Jill will make before the tank is filled, we need to calculate the rates at which Jack and Jill contribute water to the tank.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much water Jack and Jill each carry per trip:\n- Jack carries 2 buckets per trip, and each bucket holds 5 gallons. Therefore, Jack carries \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) gallons per trip.\n- Jill carries 1 bucket per trip, and each bucket holds 5 gallons. Therefore, Jill carries \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) gallons per trip.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much water Jack and Jill each contribute in the same amount of time. We know that Jack completes 3 trips in the time it takes Jill to complete 2 trips. So, in the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips, Jack makes 3 trips.\n- In the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips, Jack carries \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\) gallons.\n- In the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips, Jill carries \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) gallons.\n\nThe combined contribution of Jack and Jill in the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips is \\(30 + 10 = 40\\) gallons. Therefore, for every 2 trips Jill makes, the tank is filled with 40 gallons of water. To find out how many trips Jill needs to make to fill the 600-gallon tank, we can set up the following proportion:\n\\[\n\\frac{40 \\text{ gallons}}{2 \\text{ trips}} = \\frac{600 \\text{ gallons}}{x \\text{ trips}}\n\\]\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\\[\n40x = 1200 \\implies x = \\frac{1200}{40} = 30\n\\]\n\nThus, Jill will make \\(\\boxed{30}\\) trips before the tank is filled.",

        "To determine how many trips Jill will make before the tank is filled, we need to calculate the combined rate at which Jack and Jill fill the tank.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much water Jack and Jill each carry per trip:\n- Jack carries 2 buckets per trip, and each bucket is 5 gallons. So, Jack carries \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) gallons per trip.\n- Jill carries 1 bucket per trip, and each bucket is 5 gallons. So, Jill carries \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) gallons per trip.\n\nNext, let's find out how much water Jack and Jill each carry in the time it takes Jill to make two trips:\n- Since Jack completes three trips in the time it takes Jill to make two trips, Jack carries \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\) gallons in that time.\n- Jill carries \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) gallons in that time.\n\nSo, together they carry \\(30 + 10 = 40\\) gallons in the time it takes Jill to make two trips.\n\nTo find out how much water they carry per trip Jill makes, we need to divide the total amount of water they carry in the time it takes Jill to make two trips by 2:\n\\[ \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\text{ gallons per trip Jill makes} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many trips Jill will make to fill the 600 gallon tank:\n\\[ \\frac{600}{20} = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jill will make \\(\\boxed{30}\\) trips before the tank is filled.",
        "To determine how many trips Jill will make before the tank is filled, we need to analyze the rate at which Jack and Jill contribute water to the tank.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of water Jack and Jill each carry in one trip:\n- Jack carries 2 buckets per trip, and each bucket is 5 gallons.\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ buckets/trip} \\times 5 \\text{ gallons/bucket} = 10 \\text{ gallons/trip}\n  \\]\n\n- Jill carries 1 bucket per trip, and each bucket is 5 gallons.\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ bucket/trip} \\times 5 \\text{ gallons/bucket} = 5 \\text{ gallons/trip}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the relative number of trips Jack and Jill make in the same amount of time. According to the problem, Jack completes 3 trips in the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips. This means Jack's rate of trips is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\text{ trips}}{2 \\text{ trips}} = 1.5 \\text{ times Jill's rate}\n\\]\n\nIf Jill makes \\( x \\) trips, then Jack makes \\( 1.5x \\) trips.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of water contributed by both Jack and Jill in \\( x \\) trips by Jill:\n- Jill's total water: \\( x \\text{ trips} \\times 5 \\text{ gallons/trip} = 5x \\text{ gallons} \\)\n- Jack's total water: \\( 1.5x \\text{ trips} \\times 10 \\text{ gallons/trip} = 15x \\text{ gallons} \\)\n\nThe combined total amount of water they contribute is:\n\\[\n5x + 15x = 20x \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nWe need this total amount to equal the capacity of the tank, which is 600 gallons:\n\\[\n20x = 600\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{600}{20} = 30\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jill will make \\(\\boxed{30}\\) trips before the tank is filled.",
        "To determine how many trips Jill will make before the tank is filled, we need to calculate the amount of water each person contributes per unit of time and then find out how many total trips are needed to fill the 600-gallon tank.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of water Jack and Jill each carry in one trip:\n- Jack carries 2 buckets per trip, and each bucket holds 5 gallons, so Jack carries \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) gallons per trip.\n- Jill carries 1 bucket per trip, so she carries \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) gallons per trip.\n\nNext, we need to determine the ratio of the trips Jack and Jill make in the same amount of time. According to the problem, Jack can complete 3 trips in the time it takes Jill to complete 2 trips. Therefore, the ratio of Jack's trips to Jill's trips is 3:2.\n\nLet's say Jill makes \\(x\\) trips. Then Jack will make \\(\\frac{3}{2}x\\) trips. The total amount of water carried by both Jack and Jill in the same amount of time is:\n- Water carried by Jack: \\(10 \\times \\frac{3}{2}x = 15x\\) gallons.\n- Water carried by Jill: \\(5x\\) gallons.\n- Total water carried: \\(15x + 5x = 20x\\) gallons.\n\nWe need the total water carried to equal 600 gallons, so we set up the equation:\n\\[20x = 600\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\\[x = \\frac{600}{20} = 30\\]\n\nTherefore, Jill will make \\(\\boxed{30}\\) trips before the tank is filled.",

Since each cycle consists of Jill making 2 trips, the total number of trips Jill will make is:\n\\[\n15 \\times 2 = 30\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of trips Jill will make before the tank is filled is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
        "To determine how many trips Jill will make before the tank is filled, we need to calculate the rate at which Jack and Jill contribute water to the tank and then find out how many trips it will take for their combined effort to fill the 600-gallon tank.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of water Jack and Jill each carry per trip:\n- Jack carries 2 buckets per trip, and each bucket is 5 gallons, so Jack carries \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) gallons per trip.\n- Jill carries 1 bucket per trip, so Jill carries \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) gallons per trip.\n\nNext, let's determine the combined amount of water they carry in the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips. Since Jack can complete 3 trips in the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips, we can calculate their combined water contribution for this period:\n- In the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips, Jack makes 3 trips.\n- Therefore, in this time, Jack carries \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\) gallons, and Jill carries \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) gallons.\n- Together, they carry \\(30 + 10 = 40\\) gallons in the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many such periods are required to fill the 600-gallon tank. Since they carry 40 gallons in each 2-trip period for Jill, the number of periods needed is:\n\\[ \\frac{600}{40} = 15 \\]\n\nSince each period consists of Jill making 2 trips, the total number of trips Jill will make is:\n\\[ 15 \\times 2 = 30 \\]\n\nThus, the number of trips Jill will make before the tank is filled is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

Jack carries 2 buckets per trip, and each bucket holds 5 gallons. Therefore, Jack fills:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ buckets/trip} \\times 5 \\text{ gallons/bucket} = 10 \\text{ gallons/trip} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate Jill's rate of filling the tank. Jill carries 1 bucket per trip, and each bucket holds 5 gallons. Therefore, Jill fills:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ bucket/trip} \\times 5 \\text{ gallons/bucket} = 5 \\text{ gallons/trip} \\]\n\nWe are given that Jack can complete 3 trips in the same time it takes Jill to complete 2 trips.

We do this by dividing the total volume of the tank by the volume filled in one set of 2 trips:\n\\[ \\frac{600 \\text{ gallons}}{40 \\text{ gallons/set}} = 15 \\text{ sets} \\]\n\nSince each set consists of 2 trips by Jill, the total number of trips Jill will make is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ sets} \\times 2 \\text{ trips/set} = 30 \\text{ trips} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of trips Jill will make before the tank is filled is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{30}\n\\]",

        "To determine how many trips Jill will make before the tank is filled, we need to calculate the rate at which Jack and Jill fill the tank and then find out how many trips are required to fill the 600 gallon tank.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of water each person carries in one trip:\n- Jack carries 2 buckets, and each bucket holds 5 gallons, so Jack carries \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) gallons per trip.\n- Jill carries 1 bucket, and each bucket holds 5 gallons, so Jill carries \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) gallons per trip.\n\nNext, let's determine the ratio of the number of trips Jack and Jill make in the same amount of time:\n- Jack can complete 3 trips in the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips.\n\nLet \\(t\\) be the time it takes for Jill to make 2 trips. In that same time \\(t\\), Jack makes 3 trips. The amount of water Jack carries in \\(t\\) time is \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\) gallons, and the amount of water Jill carries in \\(t\\) time is \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) gallons. Therefore, in the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips, Jack carries 3 times as much water as Jill.\n\nNow, let's determine the total amount of water carried by Jack and Jill in the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips:\n- Total water carried in \\(t\\) time = \\(30 + 10 = 40\\) gallons.\n\nTo find out how many 2-trip intervals are needed to fill the 600 gallon tank, we divide the total capacity of the tank by the amount of water carried in one 2-trip interval:\n\\[ \\text{Number of 2-trip intervals} = \\frac{600}{40} = 15. \\]\n\nSince each 2-trip interval consists of Jill making 2 trips, the total number of trips Jill will make is:\n\\[ \\text{Total trips Jill makes} = 15 \\times 2 = 30. \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of trips Jill will make before the tank is filled is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
        "Let's start by determining the rate at which Jack and Jill fill the tank. First, we calculate how much water each person carries per trip:\n- Jack carries 2 buckets per trip, and since each bucket is 5 gallons, Jack carries \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) gallons per trip.\n- Jill carries 1 bucket per trip, so Jill carries \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) gallons per trip.\n\nNext, we need to consider the time it takes for each person to make trips. According to the problem, Jack can complete 3 trips in the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips. Let's denote the time it takes Jill to make one trip as \\(t\\). Then, the time it takes Jack to make one trip is \\(\\frac{2t}{3}\\).\n\nNow, we calculate the rate at which they fill the tank in terms of gallons per unit time:\n- Jack's rate is \\(\\frac{10 \\text{ gallons/trip}}{\\frac{2t}{3} \\text{ time/trip}} = \\frac{10 \\times 3}{2t} = \\frac{30}{2t} = \\frac{15}{t} \\text{ gallons per time}\\).\n- Jill's rate is \\(\\frac{5 \\text{ gallons/trip}}{t \\text{ time/trip}} = \\frac{5}{t} \\text{ gallons per time}\\).\n\nThe combined rate at which they fill the tank is the sum of their individual rates:\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{t} + \\frac{5}{t} = \\frac{20}{t} \\text{ gallons per time}\n\\]\n\nThe tank has a capacity of 600 gallons, so the time \\(T\\) it takes to fill the tank is:\n\\[\nT = \\frac{600 \\text{ gallons}}{\\frac{20}{t} \\text{ gallons per time}} = \\frac{600 \\times t}{20} = 30t\n\\]\n\nIn this time \\(T\\), Jill makes \\(\\frac{T}{t} = \\frac{30t}{t} = 30\\) trips. Therefore, Jill will make \\(\\boxed{30}\\) trips before the tank is filled.",
        "To determine how many trips Jill will make before the tank is filled, we need to calculate the total amount of water each person contributes per unit of time and then find out how many trips are required to fill the 600-gallon tank.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of water Jack contributes per trip:\n- Jack carries 2 buckets per trip.\n- Each bucket holds 5 gallons.\n\\[\n2 \\text{ buckets/trip} \\times 5 \\text{ gallons/bucket} = 10 \\text{ gallons/trip}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of water Jill contributes per trip:\n- Jill carries 1 bucket per trip.\n- Each bucket holds 5 gallons.\n\\[\n1 \\text{ bucket/trip} \\times 5 \\text{ gallons/bucket} = 5 \\text{ gallons/trip}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many trips they make in the same amount of time. According to the problem:\n- Jack completes 3 trips in the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips.\n\nLet's denote the number of trips Jill makes as \\( x \\). Then, the number of trips Jack makes in the same amount of time is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2}x\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of water contributed by both Jack and Jill in \\( x \\) trips by Jill:\n- The total amount of water Jack contributes in \\( \\frac{3}{2}x \\) trips is:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ gallons/trip} \\times \\frac{3}{2}x \\text{ trips} = 15x \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n- The total amount of water Jill contributes in \\( x \\) trips is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ gallons/trip} \\times x \\text{ trips} = 5x \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nThe combined total amount of water contributed by both Jack and Jill is:\n\\[\n15x \\text{ gallons} + 5x \\text{ gallons} = 20x \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nWe need this total amount to equal 600 gallons:\n\\[\n20x = 600\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{600}{20} = 30\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jill will make \\(\\boxed{30}\\) trips before the tank is filled.",
        "To determine how many trips Jill will make before the tank is filled, we need to calculate the combined work rate of Jack and Jill and then determine how many trips are required to fill the 600 gallon tank.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of water Jack and Jill can carry in one trip:\n- Jack carries 2 buckets per trip, and each bucket is 5 gallons, so Jack carries \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) gallons per trip.\n- Jill carries 1 bucket per trip, and each bucket is 5 gallons, so Jill carries \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) gallons per trip.\n\nNext, let's determine the combined work rate of Jack and Jill in terms of trips. Since Jack can complete 3 trips in the time it takes Jill to complete 2 trips, we can express their work rates in terms of Jill's trips:\n- Jack's work rate is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) trips for every trip Jill makes.\n- Therefore, Jack's water-carrying rate in terms of Jill's trips is \\(\\frac{3}{2} \\times 10 = 15\\) gallons per trip Jill makes.\n- Jill's water-carrying rate is 5 gallons per trip Jill makes.\n- Combined, they carry \\(15 + 5 = 20\\) gallons per trip Jill makes.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many trips Jill will make to fill the 600 gallon tank. Since they carry 20 gallons per trip Jill makes, the number of trips Jill will make is:\n\\[\n\\frac{600}{20} = 30\n\\]\n\nThus, Jill will make \\(\\boxed{30}\\) trips before the tank is filled.",

According to the problem, Jack can complete 3 trips in the time it takes Jill to complete 2 trips. Let's assume Jill takes \\(t\\) units of time to make 2 trips. Therefore, Jack takes \\( \\frac{2}{3}t \\) units of time to make 3 trips.\n\nTo find the combined rate, we need to compare their contributions per unit time. First, calculate their contributions over the time it takes Jill to make 2 trips:\n- In \\(t\\) units of time, Jill makes 2 trips.\n- Jill's contribution per trip is 5 gallons.\n- Therefore, Jill's
