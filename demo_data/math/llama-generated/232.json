Add the points scored during his junior year to the points scored during his senior year.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many points Michael scored during his senior year. He scored 20% more points during his senior year than during his junior year. Since he scored 260 points during his junior year, we can calculate the points scored during his senior year as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Points scored during senior year} = 260 + (0.20 \\times 260) \\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 0.20 \\times 260 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 260 = 52 \\]\n\nSo, the points scored during his senior year are:\n\n\\[ 260 + 52 = 312 \\]\n\nNow, we add the points scored during his junior year to the points scored during his senior year to find the total points scored over both years:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total points scored} = 260 + 312 = 572 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of points Michael scored during both years is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{572} \\]",

Calculate the points Michael scored during his senior year.\n2. Add the points scored during his junior year to the points scored during his senior year.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many points Michael scored during his senior year. We know that he scored 20% more points during his senior year than during his junior year. Therefore, we need to calculate 20% of his junior year points and add it to his junior year total.\n\nThe points scored during his junior year is 260. To find 20% of 260, we use the formula:\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } 260 = 0.20 \\times 260 = 52 \\]\n\nSo, the points scored during his senior year is:\n\\[ 260 + 52 = 312 \\]\n\nNow, we add the points scored during his junior year to the points scored during his senior year to find the total points scored during both years:\n\\[ 260 + 312 = 572 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of points Michael scored during both years is:\n\\[ \\boxed{572} \\]",

Add the points scored during his junior year to the points scored during his senior year.\n\nFirst, we calculate the points Michael scored during his senior year. Since he scored 20% more points during his senior year than during his junior year, we can find the senior year points by multiplying his junior year points by 1.20 (which is equivalent to 100% + 20%).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Senior year points} = 260 \\times 1.20\n\\]\n\nNext, we perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n260 \\times 1.20 = 312\n\\]\n\nSo, Michael scored 312 points during his senior year.
