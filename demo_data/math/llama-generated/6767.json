Two of them have a capacity of 8000 gallons each. Therefore, the total capacity of these two vans is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 8000 = 16000 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that one van has a capacity that is 30% less than 8000 gallons. To find the capacity of this van, we calculate 30% of 8000 and subtract it from 8000:\n\\[\n8000 \\times 0.30 = 2400 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\\[\n8000 - 2400 = 5600 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\nSo, the capacity of this van is 5600 gallons.\n\nThe remaining three vans each have a capacity that is 50% larger than the 8000 gallon vans. To find the capacity of each of these vans, we calculate 50% of 8000 and add it to 8000:\n\\[\n8000 \\times 0.50 = 4000 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\\[\n8000 + 4000 = 12000 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\nSo, each of these three vans has a capacity of 12000 gallons. Therefore, the total capacity of these three vans is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 12000 = 36000 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the capacities of all six vans:\n\\[\n16000 + 5600 + 36000 = 57600 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of gallons James can transport is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{57600}\n\\]",
