        "To determine how many more drawings Anne can make before she runs out of markers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

Anne has already made 8 drawings, so we subtract 8 from 18:\n\n\\[\n18 \\text{ drawings} - 8 \\text{ drawings} = 10 \\text{ drawings}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of more drawings Anne can make before she runs out of markers is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "To determine how many more drawings Anne can make before she runs out of markers, we start by calculating the total number of drawings she can make with her 12 markers. Since each marker lasts for 1.5 drawings, we multiply the number of markers by the number of drawings each marker can make:\n\n\\[ 12 \\text{ markers} \\times 1.5 \\text{ drawings per marker} = 18 \\text{ drawings} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of drawings Anne has already made from the total number of drawings she can make:\n\n\\[ 18 \\text{ drawings} - 8 \\text{ drawings} = 10 \\text{ drawings} \\]\n\nTherefore, Anne can make \\(\\boxed{10}\\) more drawings before she runs out of markers."
