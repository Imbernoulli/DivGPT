Clara has \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times as many pens as Alice.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pens Clara has} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 60 = \\frac{2 \\times 60}{5} = \\frac{120}{5} = 24\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the age difference between Alice and Clara.**\n\nThe difference in the number of pens that Alice and Clara each have matches their age difference.\n\\[\n\\text{Age difference} = 60 - 24 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find Clara's current age.**\n\nAlice's age is 20. Since Clara is older than Alice, we add the age difference to Alice's age.\n\\[\n\\text{Clara's current age} = 20 + 36 = 56\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Clara's age in 5 years.**\n\nTo find Clara's age in 5 years, we add 5 to her current age.\n\\[\n\\text{Clara's age in 5 years} = 56 + 5 = 61\n\\]\n\nThus, Clara's age in 5 years is \\(\\boxed{61}\\).",
        "First, we need to determine the number of pens Clara has. Alice has 60 pens, and Clara has \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times as many pens as Alice. Therefore, we calculate Clara's pens as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pens Clara has} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 60 = 24\n\\]\nNext, we need to find the difference in the number of pens that Alice and Clara have:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in pens} = 60 - 24 = 36\n\\]\nAccording to the problem, the difference in the number of pens matches their age difference. Alice's age is 20, and Clara is older than Alice. Let Clara's age be \\(C\\). Then, the age difference is:\n\\[\nC - 20 = 36\n\\]\nSolving for \\(C\\), we get:\n\\[\nC = 36 + 20 = 56\n\\]\nClara's current age is 56. To find Clara's age in 5 years, we add 5 to her current age:\n\\[\n\\text{Clara's age in 5 years} = 56 + 5 = 61\n\\]\nTherefore, Clara's age in 5 years is \\(\\boxed{61}\\).",
