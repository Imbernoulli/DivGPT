        "To determine the age of Rick's youngest brother, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Rick's age.\n2. Calculate the age of Rick's oldest brother.\n3. Calculate the age of Rick's middle brother.\n4. Calculate the age of Rick's smallest brother.\n5. Determine the age of Rick's youngest brother.\n\nFirst, we know that Rick is 15 years old. \n\nNext, we calculate the age of Rick's oldest brother, who is twice Rick's age:\n\\[\n2 \\times 15 = 30\n\\]\nSo, Rick's oldest brother is 30 years old.\n\nThen, we calculate the age of Rick's middle brother, who is a third of the oldest brother's age:\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{3} = 10\n\\]\nSo, Rick's middle brother is 10 years old.\n\nNext, we calculate the age of Rick's smallest brother, who is half the middle brother's age:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{2} = 5\n\\]\nSo, Rick's smallest brother is 5 years old.\n\nFinally, we determine the age of Rick's youngest brother, who is 2 years younger than the smallest brother:\n\\[\n5 - 2 = 3\n\\]\nSo, Rick's youngest brother is 3 years old.\n\nTherefore, the age of Rick's youngest brother is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
