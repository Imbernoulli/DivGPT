        "To determine how many trips Caleb and Cynthia need to make to fill the pool, we start by calculating the total amount of water they can add to the pool in one trip together. Caleb adds 7 gallons per trip, and Cynthia adds 8 gallons per trip. Therefore, in one trip, they add:\n\n\\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nThe pool requires 105 gallons of water to be filled. To find out how many trips they need to make, we divide the total amount of water needed by the amount of water they add per trip:\n\n\\[ 105 \\div 15 = 7 \\]\n\nSo, it will take Caleb and Cynthia 7 trips to fill the pool.
