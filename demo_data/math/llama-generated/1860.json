        "To determine the number of large posters, we need to first calculate the number of small and medium posters. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the number of small posters:\n   The store made 50 posters in total, and two-fifths of them are small posters.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of small posters} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 50 = 20\n   \\]\n\n2.

Calculate the number of large posters:\n   The rest of the posters are large posters. To find the number of large posters, we subtract the number of small and medium posters from the total number of posters.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of large posters} = 50 - \\text{Number of small posters} - \\text{Number of medium posters} = 50 - 20 - 25 = 5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of large posters is \\boxed{5}.",

The store made a total of 50 posters.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of small posters:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of small posters} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 50 = \\frac{2 \\times 50}{5} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of medium posters:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of medium posters} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 50 = \\frac{50}{2} = 25\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the number of large posters by subtracting the number of small and medium posters from the total number of posters:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of large posters} = 50 - \\text{Number of small posters} - \\text{Number of medium posters} = 50 - 20 - 25 = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of large posters is \\boxed{5}.",
