        "To determine how many seconds Heather can take to pick a weed if she wants to earn $10 an hour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert dollars to cents per hour:**\n   Heather earns $10 per hour. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert this to cents:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 100 \\text{ cents/dollar} = 1000 \\text{ cents/hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of weeds she needs to pick per hour:**\n   Heather gets paid 5 cents for each weed. To find out how many weeds she needs to pick to earn 1000 cents per hour, we divide the total amount she earns by the payment per weed:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1000 \\text{ cents/hour}}{5 \\text{ cents/weed}} = 200 \\text{ weeds/hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert hours to seconds:**\n   There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, the total number of seconds in an hour is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ minutes/hour} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} = 3600 \\text{ seconds/hour}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the time it takes to pick one weed:**\n   Heather picks 200 weeds in 3600 seconds. To find the time it takes to pick one weed, we divide the total number of seconds by the number of weeds:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3600 \\text{ seconds/hour}}{200 \\text{ weeds/hour}} = 18 \\text{ seconds/weed}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Heather can take \\(\\boxed{18}\\) seconds to pick each weed if she wants to earn $10 an hour.",

Divide the total number of seconds in an hour by the total number of weeds to find out how many seconds she can take to pick one weed.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of weeds Heather needs to pick to earn $10.**\n\nHeather earns 5 cents per weed. Since $10 is equivalent to 1000 cents (because 1 dollar = 100 cents), we can find the number of weeds she needs to pick by dividing 1000 cents by 5 cents per weed:\n\\[\n\\frac{1000 \\text{ cents}}{5 \\text{ cents per weed}} = 200 \\text{ weeds}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many seconds she has in an hour.**\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, the total number of seconds in an hour is:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ minutes} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds per minute} = 3600 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Divide the total number of seconds in an hour by the total number of weeds to find out how many seconds she can take to pick one weed.**\n\nTo find out how many seconds Heather can take to pick one weed, we divide the total number of seconds in an hour by the total number of weeds she needs to pick:\n\\[\n\\frac{3600 \\text{ seconds}}{200 \\text{ weeds}} = 18 \\text{ seconds per weed}\n\\]\n\nThus, Heather can take \\boxed{18} seconds to pick a weed if she wants to earn $10 an hour.",
        "To determine how many seconds Heather can take to pick a weed if she wants to earn $10 an hour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the hourly wage to cents per hour:**\n   Heather earns $10 per hour. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply her hourly wage by 100:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 100 \\text{ cents/dollar} = 1000 \\text{ cents/hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of weeds she needs to pick per hour:**\n   Heather gets paid 5 cents for each weed she picks. To find out how many weeds she needs to pick to earn 1000 cents in an hour, we divide her total earnings per hour by the payment per weed:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1000 \\text{ cents/hour}}{5 \\text{ cents/weed}} = 200 \\text{ weeds/hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the hourly rate to seconds per weed:**\n   There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute.
