She then has to dip the cookies in white icing and allow the icing to harden for 30 minutes. Then she has to re-dip them in chocolate icing and allowed to harden for an additional 30 minutes.  If it takes her 2 hours to make the cookies from start to finish, how long does it take to make the dough and cool the cookies before she can start dipping them?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2 hours is equivalent to:\n\\[ 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we can set up the equation to represent the total time:\n\\[ 15 + C + 30 + 30 = 120 \\]\n\nCombine the known times:\n\\[ 75 + C = 120 \\]\n\nTo find \\( C \\), subtract 75 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ C = 120 - 75 \\]\n\\[ C = 45 \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Elsa \\(\\boxed{45}\\) minutes to make the dough and cool the cookies before she can start dipping them.",
