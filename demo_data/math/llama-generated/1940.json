        "To determine how many days it will take half of the ten people to shovel 40,000 pounds of coal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the work rate of the original group:**\n   - 10 people can shovel 10,000 pounds of coal in 10 days.\n   - Therefore, the total work done by the 10 people in one day is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10,000 \\text{ pounds}}{10 \\text{ days}} = 1,000 \\text{ pounds per day}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the work rate of one person:**\n   - Since 10 people together do 1,000 pounds per day, one person does:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1,000 \\text{ pounds per day}}{10 \\text{ people}} = 100 \\text{ pounds per day per person}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the work rate of half of the ten people:**\n   - Half of 10 people is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ people}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total work rate of 5 people is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ people} \\times 100 \\text{ pounds per day per person} = 500 \\text{ pounds per day}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of days required for 5 people to shovel 40,000 pounds of coal:**\n   - The total amount of coal to be shoveled is 40,000 pounds.\n   - The work rate of 5 people is 500 pounds per day.\n   - Therefore, the number of days required is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{40,000 \\text{ pounds}}{500 \\text{ pounds per day}} = 80 \\text{ days}\n     \\]\n\nThus, it will take \\(\\boxed{80}\\) days for half of these ten people to shovel 40,000 pounds of coal.",

Since each person shovels 100 pounds of coal per day, 5 people will shovel:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ people} \\times 100 \\text{ pounds per person per day} = 500 \\text{ pounds per day} \\]\n\nFinally, we need to determine how many days it will take for these 5 people to shovel 40,000 pounds of coal. We do this by dividing the total amount of coal by the amount of coal shoveled by 5 people in one day:\n\n\\[ \\frac{40,000 \\text{ pounds}}{500 \\text{ pounds per day}} = 80 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take half of these ten people \\(\\boxed{80}\\) days to shovel 40,000 pounds of coal.",
        "To determine how many days it will take half of the ten people to shovel 40,000 pounds of coal, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Find the_shoveling rate of one person per day:**\n   - 10 people can shovel 10,000 pounds of coal in 10 days.\n   - Therefore, the total amount of coal shoveled by one person in one day is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10,000 \\text{ pounds}}{10 \\text{ people} \\times 10 \\text{ days}} = \\frac{10,000}{100} = 100 \\text{ pounds per person per day}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the shoveling rate for half of the ten people:**\n   - Half of the ten people is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ people}\n     \\]\n   - The shoveling rate for 5 people per day is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ people} \\times 100 \\text{ pounds per person per day} = 500 \\text{ pounds per day}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of days required for 5 people to shovel 40,000 pounds of coal:**\n   - The total amount of coal to be shoveled is 40,000 pounds.\n   - The number of days required is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{40,000 \\text{ pounds}}{500 \\text{ pounds per day}} = 80 \\text{ days}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take half of these ten people \\boxed{80} days to shovel 40,000 pounds of coal."
