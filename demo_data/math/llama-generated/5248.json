Determine the total area of the three lawns she has already mowed.\n3. Calculate the total amount of money she has earned from mowing the three lawns.\n4. Determine how much more money she needs to earn.\n5. Calculate how many more square feet she has to mow to earn the remaining money.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1.

Since LaKeisha has mowed three lawns, the total area she has mowed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total area} = 3 \\times 300 = 900 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. LaKeisha charges $0.10 per square foot, so the total amount of money she has earned is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total money earned} = 900 \\times 0.10 = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. The book set costs $150, so the amount of money LaKeisha still needs to earn is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining money needed} = 150 - 90 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. Since LaKeisha earns $0.10 per square foot, the number of additional square feet she has to mow to earn the remaining $60 is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional square feet needed} = \\frac{60}{0.10} = 600 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, LaKeisha has to mow \\boxed{600} more square feet to earn enough for the book set.",
