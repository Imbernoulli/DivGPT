        "To determine how many pounds of garbage Zane picked up, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many pounds of garbage Dewei picked up.\n2. Use the amount Dewei picked up to find out how many pounds Zane picked up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many pounds of garbage Dewei picked up. Dewei picked up 2 pounds less than Daliah. Since Daliah picked up 17.5 pounds, we can find Dewei's total by subtracting 2 from 17.5:\n\\[\n17.5 - 2 = 15.5\n\\]\nSo, Dewei picked up 15.5 pounds of garbage.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pounds of garbage Zane picked up. Zane picked up 4 times as many pounds of garbage as Dewei. Since Dewei picked up 15.5 pounds, we can find Zane's total by multiplying 15.5 by 4:\n\\[\n15.5 \\times 4 = 62\n\\]\nSo, Zane picked up 62 pounds of garbage.\n\nTherefore, the number of pounds of garbage Zane picked up is \\boxed{62}.",

        "To determine how many pounds of garbage Zane picked up, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how many pounds of garbage Dewei picked up.\n2. Use the amount Dewei picked up to find out how many pounds Zane picked up.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many pounds of garbage Dewei picked up. Dewei picked up 2 pounds less than Daliah. Since Daliah picked up 17.5 pounds, we subtract 2 pounds from 17.5 pounds:\n\\[ 17.5 - 2 = 15.5 \\]\nSo, Dewei picked up 15.5 pounds of garbage.\n\nNext, we calculate how many pounds of garbage Zane picked up. Zane picked up 4 times as many pounds of garbage as Dewei. Since Dewei picked up 15.5 pounds, we multiply 15.5 pounds by 4:\n\\[ 15.5 \\times 4 = 62 \\]\nSo, Zane picked up 62 pounds of garbage.\n\nTherefore, the number of pounds of garbage Zane picked up is \\(\\boxed{62}\\).",
