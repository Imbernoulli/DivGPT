We know that 30% of the remaining substitute teachers quit before lunch. So, we need to find 30% of 30.\n\n\\[ 30 \\times 0.30 = 9 \\]\n\nThis means that 9 substitute teachers quit before lunch. To find out how many substitute teachers are left after lunch, we subtract the number of teachers who quit from the number of teachers who remained after the first hour.\n\n\\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of substitute teachers left after lunch is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
