        "To determine the number of campers last week, we need to break down the information given and solve step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the number of campers three weeks ago:**\n   - Two weeks ago, there were 40 campers.\n   - This number was 10 more than the number of campers three weeks ago.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of campers three weeks ago.\n   - Therefore, we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     40 = x + 10\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 40 - 10 = 30\n     \\]\n   - So, three weeks ago, there were 30 campers.\n\n2. **Determine the number of campers two weeks ago:**\n   - We already know from the problem statement that two weeks ago, there were 40 campers.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of campers for the past three weeks:**\n   - We are given that the total number of campers for the past three weeks is 150.\n   - Let \\( y \\) be the number of campers last week.\n   - Therefore, we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     30 + 40 + y = 150\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the left-hand side:\n     \\[\n     70 + y = 150\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( y \\):\n     \\[\n     y = 150 - 70 = 80\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of campers last week was \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
        "To determine the number of campers last week, we start by defining the number of campers three weeks ago as \\( x \\). According to the problem, two weeks ago there were 40 campers, which was 10 more than the number of campers three weeks ago. Therefore, we can express the number of campers two weeks ago as \\( x + 10 \\).\n\nWe know the total number of campers over the three weeks is 150. So, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of campers:\n\n\\[\nx + (x + 10) + y = 150\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( y \\) is the number of campers last week. Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n2x + 10 + y = 150\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( y \\) by subtracting \\( 2x + 10 \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\ny = 150 - 2x - 10\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\n\\[\ny = 140 - 2x\n\\]\n\nWe already know that \\( x = 40 - 10 = 30 \\), so substituting \\( x = 30 \\) into the equation for \\( y \\), we get:\n\n\\[\ny = 140 - 2(30)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n\\[\ny = 140 - 60\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = 80\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of campers last week is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",

Therefore, we can express the number of campers two weeks ago as \\( x + 10 \\). The total number of campers over the three weeks is given as 150. Thus, we can write the following equation:\n\n\\[\nx + (x + 10) + y = 150\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( y \\) is the number of campers last week. Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n2x + 10 + y = 150\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( y \\) by subtracting \\( 2x + 10 \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\ny = 150 - 2x - 10\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we have:\n\n\\[\ny = 140 - 2x\n\\]\n\nWe know that two weeks ago there were 40 campers, so \\( x + 10 = 40 \\). Solving for \\( x \\), we subtract 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = 30\n\\]\n\nNow that we know \\( x = 30 \\), we substitute this value back into the equation for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\ny = 140 - 2(30)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\n\\[\ny = 140 - 60\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = 80\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of campers last week is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",

According to the problem, two weeks ago there were \\( x + 10 \\) campers. We know that two weeks ago there were 40 campers, so we can set up the equation:\n\\[ x + 10 = 40 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 40 - 10 \\]\n\\[ x = 30 \\]\n\nSo, three weeks ago there were 30 campers. Now, we know the number of campers for each of the three weeks:\n- Three weeks ago: 30 campers\n- Two weeks ago: 40 campers\n\nLet's denote the number of campers last week as \\( y \\). The total number of campers over the three weeks is the sum of the campers from each week:\n\\[ 30 + 40 + y = 150 \\]\n\nTo find \\( y \\), we subtract the sum of the campers from three weeks ago and two weeks ago from the total number of campers:\n\\[ y = 150 - 30 - 40 \\]\n\\[ y = 80 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of campers last week was \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
        "Let's define the number of campers three weeks ago as \\( x \\). According to the problem, two weeks ago there were 40 campers, which was 10 more than the number of campers three weeks ago.
