        "To determine the total distance walked by Nadia and Hannah, we start by finding out how far Hannah walked. According to the problem, Nadia walked 18 kilometers, which was twice as far as Hannah walked. Let's denote the distance Hannah walked as \\( h \\) kilometers. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 18 = 2h \\]\n\nTo find \\( h \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\]\n\nSo, Hannah walked 9 kilometers. Now, we need to find the total distance walked by both Nadia and Hannah. We do this by adding the distance Nadia walked to the distance Hannah walked:\n\n\\[ 18 + 9 = 27 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance walked by the two girls is \\(\\boxed{27}\\) kilometers.",
