        "To determine how many slices of bread remain, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how many slices of bread were eaten for breakfast.\n2. Subtract the slices eaten for breakfast from the original number of slices.\n3. Subtract the slices used for lunch from the remaining slices.\n\nFirst, we know that Neeley's family ate a third of the bread slices for breakfast. Since the loaf was sliced into 12 pieces, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Slices eaten for breakfast} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n\\]\nNext, we subtract the slices eaten for breakfast from the original number of slices:\n\\[\n\\text{Slices remaining after breakfast} = 12 - 4 = 8\n\\]\nThen, Neeley used 2 bread slices to make a sandwich for lunch.
