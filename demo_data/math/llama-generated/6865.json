Divide the remaining number of photos by the number of remaining pages to find out how many photos can be placed on each page.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Alyssa places 3 photos on each of the first 10 pages. Therefore, the total number of photos placed on the first 10 pages is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\]\n\nNext, Alyssa places 4 photos on each of the next 10 pages. Therefore, the total number of photos placed on the next 10 pages is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of photos placed on the first 10 pages and the next 10 pages to find out how many photos have already been placed:\n\\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \\]\n\nAlyssa took 100 photos in total, so the number of photos left to be placed is:\n\\[ 100 - 70 = 30 \\]\n\nAlyssa has 30 pages left in the album, but she has already used 20 pages (10 + 10). Therefore, the number of pages left is:\n\\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \\]\n\nTo find out how many photos can be placed on each of the remaining 10 pages, we divide the remaining number of photos by the number of remaining pages:\n\\[ 30 \\div 10 = 3 \\]\n\nSo, Alyssa can place \\(\\boxed{3}\\) photos on each of the remaining pages of the album."
