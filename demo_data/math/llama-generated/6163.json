        "To determine how many senior high school students did not pass their exams, we start by calculating the number of students who passed their exams. Given that 75% of the 804 students passed, we can find this number by multiplying 804 by 75%.\n\nFirst, we convert the percentage to a decimal:\n\\[ 75\\% = 0.75 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply the total number of students by this decimal:\n\\[ 804 \\times 0.75 = 603 \\]\n\nSo, 603 students passed their exams. To find out how many did not pass, we subtract the number of students who passed from the total number of students:\n\\[ 804 - 603 = 201 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students who did not pass their exams is:\n\\[ \\boxed{201} \\]",
