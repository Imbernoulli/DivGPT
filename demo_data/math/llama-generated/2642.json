        "To determine the total number of pieces of fruit Gabby got to pick, we need to calculate the number of each type of fruit she harvested and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Watermelons:**\n   Gabby harvested 1 watermelon.\n\n2. **Peaches:**\n   Gabby harvested 12 more peaches than watermelons. Since she harvested 1 watermelon, we calculate the number of peaches as follows:\n   \\[\n   1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n   So, Gabby harvested 13 peaches.\n\n3. **Plums:**\n   Gabby harvested three times the number of peaches. Since she harvested 13 peaches, we calculate the number of plums as follows:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 13 = 39\n   \\]\n   So, Gabby harvested 39 plums.\n\nNext, we sum up the number of watermelons, peaches, and plums to find the total number of pieces of fruit:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ (watermelon)} + 13 \\text{ (peaches)} + 39 \\text{ (plums)} = 53\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pieces of fruit Gabby got to pick that summer is \\boxed{53}.",
        "To determine the total number of pieces of fruit Gabby picked, we need to calculate the number of each type of fruit and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Watermelons**: Gabby planted a watermelon vine and got one watermelon to grow.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Watermelons} = 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Peaches**: Gabby got twelve more peaches than the number of watermelons.
