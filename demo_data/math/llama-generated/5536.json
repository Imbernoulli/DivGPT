        "To determine the cost to build 4 birdhouses, we need to calculate the total cost of the planks and nails required for all 4 birdhouses.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of planks needed for 4 birdhouses:\n\\[\n7 \\text{ planks/birdhouse} \\times 4 \\text{ birdhouses} = 28 \\text{ planks}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of these planks. Since each plank costs $3, we have:\n\\[\n28 \\text{ planks} \\times \\$3/\\text{plank} = \\$84\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of nails needed for 4 birdhouses:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ nails/birdhouse} \\times 4 \\text{ birdhouses} = 80 \\text{ nails}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of these nails. Since each nail costs $0.05, we have:\n\\[\n80 \\text{ nails} \\times \\$0.05/\\text{nail} = \\$4\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the total cost of the planks and the total cost of the nails to find the overall cost to build 4 birdhouses:\n\\[\n\\$84 + \\$4 = \\$88\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost to build 4 birdhouses is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88}\n\\]"
