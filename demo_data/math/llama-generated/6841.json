        "To determine how many more cars one level can fit if there are already 23 parked cars on that level, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the capacity of one level of the parking lot.\n2. Subtract the number of parked cars on that level from the capacity of that level.\n\nFirst, we find the capacity of one level. The parking lot has a total capacity of 425 cars and consists of 5 levels. Therefore, the capacity of one level is:\n\\[\n\\frac{425}{5} = 85\n\\]\nSo, each level can hold 85 cars.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more cars can fit on a level that already has 23 parked cars. We do this by subtracting the number of parked cars from the capacity of the level:\n\\[\n85 - 23 = 62\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of additional cars that one level can fit is \\boxed{62}.",

Subtract the number of parked cars on that level from the level's capacity.\n\nFirst, we know the total capacity of the parking lot is 425 cars and it has 5 levels. Therefore, the capacity of one level is:\n\\[\n\\frac{425}{5} = 85\n\\]\nThis means each level can hold 85 cars.\n\nNext, we are given that there are already 23 parked cars on one level. To find out how many more cars can fit on that level, we subtract the number of parked cars from the level's capacity:\n\\[\n85 - 23 = 62\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of additional cars that can fit on that level is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{62}\n\\]"
