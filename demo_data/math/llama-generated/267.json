        "To determine how many people will win a prize, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people who have an envelope taped underneath their chairs.\n2. Determine how many of these people have \"You Won\" in their envelope.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of people who have an envelope taped under their chairs. Since 40% of the 100 people have envelopes, we can find this number by multiplying 100 by 40% (or 0.40):\n\n\\[\n100 \\times 0.40 = 40\n\\]\n\nSo, 40 people have envelopes taped under their chairs.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these 40 people have \"You Won\" in their envelope. Since 20% of the people with envelopes will have \"You Won\" in their envelope, we can find this number by multiplying 40 by 20% (or 0.20):\n\n\\[\n40 \\times 0.20 = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, 8 people will win a prize.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who will win a prize is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

Next, we need to find out how many of these 40 people have \"You Won\" in their envelope. Since 20% of the people with envelopes will have \"You Won\" in their envelope, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 40 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, 8 people will have \"You Won\" in their envelope.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who will win a prize is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
