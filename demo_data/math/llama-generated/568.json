        "To determine how much money each boy makes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of shrimp Austin's trap caught.\n2. Calculate the total number of shrimp caught by Victor and Austin.\n3. Calculate the number of shrimp Brian's trap caught.\n4. Find the total number of shrimp caught by all three boys.\n5. Determine the total earnings from selling the shrimp.\n6. Divide the total earnings equally among the three boys.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Austin's trap caught 8 less shrimp than Victor's trap. Since Victor's trap caught 26 shrimp, we have:\n   \\[\n   26 - 8 = 18\n   \\]\n   So, Austin's trap caught 18 shrimp.\n\n2. The total number of shrimp caught by Victor and Austin is:\n   \\[\n   26 + 18 = 44\n   \\]\n\n3. Brian's trap caught half of the total number of shrimp caught by Victor and Austin. So, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{44}{2} = 22\n   \\]\n   So, Brian's trap caught 22 shrimp.\n\n4. The total number of shrimp caught by all three boys is:\n   \\[\n   26 + 18 + 22 = 66\n   \\]\n\n5. The boys sold the shrimp for $7 for every 11 tails of shrimp. Therefore, the total earnings are:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{66}{11} \\times 7 = 6 \\times 7 = 42\n   \\]\n   So, the total earnings are $42.\n\n6. The total earnings are divided equally among the three boys. So, each boy makes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{42}{3} = 14\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each boy makes \\(\\boxed{14}\\) dollars.",

Austin's trap caught 8 less shrimp than Victor's trap. Since Victor's trap caught 26 shrimp, we have:\n   \\[\n   26 - 8 = 18\n   \\]\n   So, Austin's trap caught 18 shrimp.\n\n2. The total number of shrimp caught by Victor and Austin is:\n   \\[\n   26 + 18 = 44\n   \\]\n\n3. Brian's trap caught half of the total number of shrimp caught by Victor and Austin. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{44}{2} = 22\n   \\]\n   So, Brian's trap caught 22 shrimp.\n\n4. The total number of shrimp caught by all three boys is:\n   \\[\n   26 + 18 + 22 = 66\n   \\]\n\n5. The boys sold the shrimp for $7 for every 11 tails of shrimp. So, the total earnings from selling the shrimp is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{66}{11} \\times 7 = 6 \\times 7 = 42\n   \\]\n   So, the total earnings are $42.\n\n6. The total earnings are to be divided equally among the three boys. Therefore, each boy makes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{42}{3} = 14\n   \\]\n   So, each boy makes $14.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]",

The total number of shrimp caught by Victor and Austin is:\n   \\[\n   26 + 18 = 44\n   \\]\n\n3. Brian's trap caught half of the total number of shrimp caught by Victor and Austin. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{44}{2} = 22\n   \\]\n   So, Brian's trap caught 22 shrimp.\n\n4. The total number of shrimp caught by all three boys is:\n   \\[\n   26 + 18 + 22 = 66\n   \\]\n\n5. The boys sold the shrimp for $7 for every 11 tails of shrimp. To find out how many sets of 11 tails are in 66 shrimp, we divide 66 by 11:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{66}{11} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, they sold 6 sets of 11 tails of shrimp. The total earnings from selling the shrimp is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 7 = 42\n   \\]\n   So, the total earnings are $42.\n\n6. To find out how much money each boy makes, we divide the total earnings by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{42}{3} = 14\n   \\]\n   So, each boy makes $14.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money each boy makes is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",

Calculate the total earnings from selling the shrimp.\n6. Divide the total earnings equally among the three boys.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Austin's trap caught 8 less shrimp than Victor's trap. Since Victor's trap caught 26 shrimp, we have:\n\\[ 26 - 8 = 18 \\]\nSo, Austin's trap caught 18 shrimp.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of shrimp caught by Victor and Austin:\n\\[ 26 + 18 = 44 \\]\nSo, Victor and Austin together caught 44 shrimp.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of shrimp Brian's trap caught. Brian's trap caught half of the total number of shrimp caught by Victor and Austin:\n\\[ \\frac{44}{2} = 22 \\]\nSo, Brian's trap caught 22 shrimp.\n\nNext, we determine the total number of shrimp caught by all three boys:\n\\[ 26 + 18 + 22 = 66 \\]\nSo, the total number of shrimp caught is 66.\n\nNow, we calculate the total earnings from selling the shrimp. The boys sold the shrimp for $7 for every 11 tails of shrimp. Since they caught 66 shrimp, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{66}{11} = 6 \\]\nSo, they sold 6 sets of 11 shrimp. Therefore, their total earnings are:\n\\[ 6 \\times 7 = 42 \\]\nSo, the total earnings are $42.\n\nFinally, we divide the total earnings equally among the three boys:\n\\[ \\frac{42}{3} = 14 \\]\nSo, each boy makes $14.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
