        "To determine Bob's grade, we need to follow the steps builds on the information given:\n\n1. **Jenny's Grade**: Jenny received a score of 95 on her paper.\n\n2. **Jason's Grade**: Jason's grade was 25 points less than Jenny's grade. We can calculate Jason's grade by subtracting 25 from Jenny's score:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jason's grade} = \\text{Jenny's grade} - 25 = 95 - 25 = 70\n   \\]\n\n3. **Bob's Grade**: Bob's grade was equal to half of Jason's grade. We can calculate Bob's grade by dividing Jason's score by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bob's grade} = \\frac{\\text{Jason's grade}}{2} = \\frac{70}{2} = 35\n   \\]\n\nThus, Bob's grade is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",
