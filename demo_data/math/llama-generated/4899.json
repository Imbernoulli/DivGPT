        "To determine the percentage of ink left after TreShaun colors in two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total area that the full marker can cover.\n2. Calculate the area that TreShaun has colored in.\n3. Determine the remaining area that the marker can cover.\n4. Convert the remaining area to a percentage of the total area.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total area that the full marker can cover. The marker can paint three 4 inch by 4 inch squares. The area of one square is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ inches} \\times 4 \\text{ inches} = 16 \\text{ square inches} \\]\nSo, the total area for three squares is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 16 \\text{ square inches} = 48 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the area that TreShaun has colored in. Each rectangle is 6 inches by 2 inches, so the area of one rectangle is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ inches} \\times 2 \\text{ inches} = 12 \\text{ square inches} \\]\nSince TreShaun colors in two rectangles, the total area he has colored in is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 \\text{ square inches} = 24 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the remaining area that the marker can cover. The remaining area is the total area minus the area that has been colored in:\n\\[ 48 \\text{ square inches} - 24 \\text{ square inches} = 24 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the remaining area to a percentage of the total area.

        "To determine the percentage of ink left after TreShaun colors in two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total area that the full marker can cover.\n2. Calculate the total area that TreShaun has painted.\n3. Determine the remaining area that the marker can cover.\n4. Convert the remaining area into a percentage of the total area.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total area that the full marker can cover. The marker can paint three 4 inch by 4 inch squares. The area of one square is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ inches} \\times 4 \\text{ inches} = 16 \\text{ square inches} \\]\nSo, the total area for three squares is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 16 \\text{ square inches} = 48 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total area that TreShaun has painted. He has colored in two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles. The area of one rectangle is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ inches} \\times 2 \\text{ inches} = 12 \\text{ square inches} \\]\nSo, the total area for two rectangles is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 \\text{ square inches} = 24 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the remaining area that the marker can cover. We subtract the area that TreShaun has painted from the total area the marker can cover:\n\\[ 48 \\text{ square inches} - 24 \\text{ square inches} = 24 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the remaining area into a percentage of the total area. The percentage is calculated by dividing the remaining area by the total area and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{24 \\text{ square inches}}{48 \\text{ square inches}} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of ink left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",

Since the original amount of ink was enough to cover 48 square inches, the amount of ink left is:\n\\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nTo find the percentage of ink left, we divide the remaining ink by the original amount of ink and then multiply by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{24}{48} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of ink left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",

Calculate the total area of two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles.\n5. Determine how much ink is used by comparing the areas.\n6. Calculate the percentage of ink left.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the area of one 4 inch by 4 inch square.**\n\nThe area of a square is given by the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\text{side}^2 \\]\n\nFor a 4 inch by 4 inch square:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = 4^2 = 16 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total area of three 4 inch by 4 inch squares.**\n\nSince there are three squares:\n\\[ \\text{Total area} = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the area of one 6 inch by 2 inch rectangle.**\n\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\]\n\nFor a 6 inch by 2 inch rectangle:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total area of two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles.**\n\nSince there are two rectangles:\n\\[ \\text{Total area} = 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\n**Step 5: Determine how much ink is used by comparing the areas.**\n\nThe total area of the two rectangles is 24 square inches, so TreShaun uses 24 square inches of ink. The total area of the three squares is 48 square inches, so the amount of ink left is:\n\\[ \\text{Ink left} = 48 - 24 = 24 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the percentage of ink left.**\n\nThe percentage of ink left is given by the ratio of the remaining ink to the original amount of ink, multiplied by 100:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of ink left} = \\left( \\frac{24}{48} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.5 \\times 100 = 50\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of ink left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",
        "To determine what percentage of ink TreShaun has left after coloring in two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the area of one 4 inch by 4 inch square.\n2. Calculate the total area of three 4 inch by 4 inch squares.\n3. Calculate the area of one 6 inch by 2 inch rectangle.\n4. Calculate the total area of two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles.\n5. Determine the amount of ink used.\n6. Determine the amount of ink remaining.\n7. Calculate the percentage of ink left.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of one 4 inch by 4 inch square:\n\\[\n4 \\times 4 = 16 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\nSince TreShaun's marker has enough ink to paint three 4 inch by 4 inch squares, the total area he can paint with the marker is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 16 = 48 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the area of one 6 inch by 2 inch rectangle:\n\\[\n6 \\times 2 = 12 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\nSince TreShaun colors in two 6 inch by 2 inch rectangles, the total area he colors in is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nNow, we determine the amount of ink used, which is the total area colored in:\n\\[\n24 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\nThe amount of ink remaining is the total area the marker can paint minus the area colored in:\n\\[\n48 - 24 = 24 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of ink left:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{24}{48} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage of ink left is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]"
