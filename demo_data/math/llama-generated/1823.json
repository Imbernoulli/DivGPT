        "To determine how many yards past the finish line Kenneth will be when Biff crosses the finish line, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

The race is 500 yards long.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for Biff} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{500 \\text{ yards}}{50 \\text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the time it takes for Kenneth to finish the race:**\n   Kenneth rows at a speed of 51 yards per minute. The race is 500 yards long.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for Kenneth} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{500 \\text{ yards}}{51 \\text{ yards per minute}} \\approx 9.8039 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how far Kenneth will have rowed in the time it takes Biff to finish the race:**\n   Kenneth rows for 10 minutes.他的 speed is 51 yards per minute.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance for Kenneth in 10 minutes} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 51 \\text{ yards per minute} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} = 510 \\text{ yards}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the length of the race from the distance Kenneth has rowed to find out how many yards past the finish line Kenneth will be:**\n   The race is 500 yards long. Kenneth has rowed 510 yards.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Yards past the finish line} = \\text{Distance for Kenneth} - \\text{Distance of the race} = 510 \\text{ yards} - 500 \\text{ yards} = 10 \\text{ yards}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Kenneth will be \\(\\boxed{10}\\) yards past the finish line when Biff crosses the finish line.",

        "To determine how many yards past the finish line Kenneth will be when Biff crosses the finish line, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the time it takes for Biff to finish the race:**\n   - Biff's rowing speed is 50 yards per minute.\n   - The race distance is 500 yards.\n   - Time taken by Biff to finish the race is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time\\_Biff} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{500 \\text{ yards}}{50 \\text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the distance Kenneth covers in the same time:**\n   - Kenneth's rowing speed is 51 yards per minute.\n   - The time taken is 10 minutes.\n   - Distance covered by Kenneth in 10 minutes is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance\\_Kenneth} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 51 \\text{ yards per minute} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} = 510 \\text{ yards}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many yards past the finish line Kenneth is:**\n   - The finish line is at 500 yards.\n   - The distance Kenneth covers is 510 yards.\n   - The distance past the finish line is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance past the finish line} = \\text{Distance\\_Kenneth} - \\text{Distance\\_ //( finish line} = 510 \\text{ yards} - 500 \\text{ yards} = 10 \\text{ yards}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Kenneth will be \\(\\boxed{10}\\) yards past the finish line when Biff crosses the finish line.",
        "To determine how many yards past the finish line Kenneth will be when Biff crosses the finish line, we need to calculate the time it takes each of them to complete the race and then find out how far Kenneth has rowed in that time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes Biff to row 500 yards. Biff rows at a speed of 50 yards per minute. Therefore, the time it takes Biff to row 500 yards is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time for Biff} = \\frac{500 \\text{ yards}}{50 \\text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes Kenneth to row 500 yards. Kenneth rows at a speed of 51 yards per minute. Therefore, the time it takes Kenneth to row 500 yards is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time for Kenneth} = \\frac{500 \\text{ yards}}{51 \\text{ yards per minute}} = \\frac{500}{51} \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nSince Biff takes 10 minutes to finish the race, we need to determine how far Kenneth has rowed in 10 minutes. Kenneth rows at a speed of 51 yards per minute, so in 10 minutes, he will have rowed:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance for Kenneth in 10 minutes} = 51 \\text{ yards per minute} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} = 510 \\text{ yards}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Kenneth will be:\n\\[\n510 \\text{ yards} - 500 \\text{ yards} = 10 \\text{ yards}\n\\]\npast the finish line when Biff crosses the finish line.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",
