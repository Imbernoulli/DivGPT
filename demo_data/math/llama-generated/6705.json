        "To determine how much Jason has been earning per month from his investment, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the total earnings over 5 months**: Jason has earned the same amount he invested twice over. This means his total earnings are equal to \\(2 \\times \\text{initial investment}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the initial investment**: Let \\(I\\) be the initial investment. According to the problem, the current value of the investment is $90. This current value is the sum of the initial investment and the total earnings over 5 months. Therefore, we can write:\n   \\[\n   I + 2I = 90\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   3I = 90\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(I\\), we divide both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   I = 30\n   \\]\n   So, Jason's initial investment was $30.\n\n3. **Calculate the total earnings**: Since Jason's initial investment was $30 and he has earned the same amount he invested twice over, his total earnings over 5 months is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 30 = 60\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the monthly earnings**: To find out how much Jason has been earning per month, we divide the total earnings by the number of months:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{5} = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jason has been earning \\(\\boxed{12}\\) dollars per month from his investment.",
        "Let's denote the amount Jason initially invested as \\( x \\). According to the problem, Jason has earned the same amount he invested twice over in 5 months. This means that the total value of his investment after 5 months is \\( x + 2x = 3x \\).\n\nWe are given that the current value of Jason's investment is $90. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 3x = 90 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ x = \\frac{90}{3} = 30 \\]\n\nSo, Jason initially invested $30. Since he has earned $60 ($90 - $30) over 5 months, the amount he has been earning per month is:\n\\[ \\frac{60}{5} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jason has been earning \\(\\boxed{12}\\) dollars per month from his investment.",
        "To determine how much Jason has been earning per month from his investment, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the total growth of the investment:**\n   Jason has earned the same amount he invested twice over. This means his investment has tripled in value.\n\n2. **Calculate the initial investment:**\n   If the current value of the investment is $90, and it has tripled, we can find the initial investment by dividing the current value by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial Investment} = \\frac{90}{3} = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total earnings:**\n   The total earnings over the 5 months is the difference between the current value and the initial investment:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Earnings} = 90 - 30 = 60\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the earnings per month:**\n   To find the earnings per month, we divide the total earnings by the number of months:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings per Month} = \\frac{60}{5} = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jason has been earning \\(\\boxed{12}\\) dollars per month from his investment.",
