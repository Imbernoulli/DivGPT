        "To determine how much James paid for the stickers, we start by calculating the total number of stickers. James has 4 packs of stickers, and each pack contains 30 stickers. Therefore, the total number of stickers is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 30 = 120 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out the total cost of these stickers. Each sticker costs $0.10, so the total cost for 120 stickers is:\n\n\\[ 120 \\times 0.10 = 12 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nJames's friend pays for half of the total cost. Therefore, James pays the other half. So, we calculate half of $12:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the amount James paid is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",

        "To determine how much James paid for the stickers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of stickers James has.\n2. Determine the total cost of all the stickers.\n3. Find out how much James pays after his friend pays for half of the cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of stickers James has. Since he has 4 packs and each pack contains 30 stickers, we multiply the number of packs by the number of stickers per pack:\n\\[\n4 \\times 30 = 120\n\\]\nSo, James has 120 stickers.\n\nNext, we need to find the total cost of all the stickers. Each sticker costs $0.10, so we multiply the total number of stickers by the cost per sticker:\n\\[\n120 \\times 0.10 = 12\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of all the stickers is $12.\n\nSince his friend pays for half of the cost, James pays the other half. We divide the total cost by 2:\n\\[\n12 \\div 2 = 6\n\\]\nSo, James pays $6.\n\nTherefore, the amount James paid is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
