        "To determine how many candies Jake's friend can purchase with the money Jake gave to him, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Jake's total feeding allowance in dollars:**\n   Jake's feeding allowance is given as $4.\n\n2. **Determine the fraction of the feeding allowance Jake gave to his friend:**\n   Jake gave one-quarter of his feeding allowance to his friend. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ of } \\$4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the amount of money Jake gave to his friend:**\n   To find one-quarter of $4, we multiply:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\$4 = \\$1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the cost of one candy:**\n   Each candy costs 20 cents, which can be expressed in dollars as:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ cents} = \\$0.20\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of candies Jake's friend can purchase:**\n   To find out how many candies Jake's friend can buy with $1, we divide the amount of money by the cost of one candy:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$1}{\\$0.20} = 5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jake's friend can purchase \\(\\boxed{5}\\) candies with the money Jake gave to him.",

Therefore, we need to calculate one-quarter of $4:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount given to friend} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 4 = 1 \\text{ dollar}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many candies his friend can buy with $1. Each candy costs 20 cents, which is equivalent to $0.20. To find out how many candies $1 can buy, we divide $1 by the cost of one candy:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of candies} = \\frac{1}{0.20} = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, Jake's friend can purchase \\boxed{5} candies with the money Jake gave to him.",
