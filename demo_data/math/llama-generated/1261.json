In a typical year, the rancher will allow his animals to feed off his pastures for as long as possible before they run out of grass.  After the pastures run out of grass, he must buy feed corn for $10 per bag.  Each cow eats 2 acres of grass per month, and each sheep eats 1 acre of grass per month.  Additionally, a bag of feed corn can feed each cow for 1 month and each sheep for 2 months.   If the rancher's pasture contains 144 acres of grass, how much will the rancher need to spend on feed corn to feed his animals each year?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how much the rancher needs to spend on feed corn each year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of grass consumed by the animals per month.\n2.

Compute the total cost of the feed corn.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of grass consumed by the animals per month.**\n\nEach cow eats 2 acres of grass per month, and each sheep eats 1 acre of grass per month. The rancher has 5 cattle and 8 sheep.\n\\[\n\\text{Total grass consumed per month} = (5 \\text{ cattle} \\times 2 \\text{ acres/cow}) + (8 \\text{ sheep} \\times 1 \\text{ acre/sheep}) = 10 \\text{ acres} + 8 \\text{ acres} = 18 \\text{ acres/month}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how long the pasture will last in months.**\n\nThe pasture contains 144 acres of grass. To find out how many months the pasture will last, we divide the total amount of grass by the monthly consumption.\n\\[\n\\text{Annegetting time} = \\frac{144 \\text{ acres}}{18 \\text{ acres/month}} = 8 \\text{ months}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the amount of feed corn needed for the remaining months of the year.**\n\nThere are 12 months in a year, so the number of months after the pasture runs out of grass is:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ months} - 8 \\text{ months} = 4 \\text{ months}\n\\]\n\nEach bag of feed corn can feed each cow for 1 month and each sheep for 2 months. Therefore, we need to calculate the total amount of feed corn required for the remaining 4 months.\n\\[\n\\text{Stories corn needed} = (5 \\text{ cows} \\times 4 \\text{ months} \\times 1 \\text{ bag/cow/month}) + (8 \\text{ sheep} \\times 4 \\text{ months} \\times 1/2 \\text{ bag/sheep/month}) = 20 \\text{ bags} + 16 \\text{ bags} = 36 \\text{ bags}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Compute the total cost of the feed corn.**\n\nEach bag of feed corn costs $10, so the total cost for 36 bags is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 36 \\text{ bags} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/bag} = 360 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the rancher will need to spend \\(\\boxed{360}\\) dollars on feed corn to feed his animals each year.",
        "To determine how much the rancher will need to spend on feed corn, we first need to calculate how long the pasture will last and how much feed corn will be required for the remaining months.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of grass consumed by the animals per month. Each cow eats 2 acres of grass per month, and each sheep eats 1 acre of grass per month. Therefore, the total grass consumption per month is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ cows} \\times 2 \\text{ acres/cow} + 8 \\text{ sheep} \\times 1 \\text{ acre/sheep} = 10 \\text{ acres} + 8 \\text{ acres} = 18 \\text{ acres/month} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many months the pasture will last. The pasture contains 144 acres of grass, so the number of months the pasture will last is:\n\\[ \\frac{144 \\text{ acres}}{18 \\text{ acres/month}} = 8 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nSince there are 12 months in a year, the number of months after the pasture runs out of grass is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ months} - 8 \\text{ months} = 4 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate how much feed corn is required for the remaining 4 months. Each cow eats 1 bag of feed corn per month, and each sheep eats 0.5 bags of feed corn per month. Therefore, the total amount of feed corn required per month is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ cows} \\times 1 \\text{ bag/cow} + 8 \\text{ sheep} \\times 0.5 \\text{ bags/sheep} = 5 \\text{ bags} + 4 \\text{ bags} = 9 \\text{ bags/month} \\]\n\nSince the rancher needs feed corn for 4 months, the total amount of feed corn required is:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ bags/month} \\times 4 \\text{ months} = 36 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nFinally, since each bag of feed corn costs $10, the total cost of the feed corn is:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ bags} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/bag} = 360 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the rancher will need to spend \\(\\boxed{360}\\) dollars on feed corn to feed his animals each year.",

The total number of months in a year is 12, so the number of months left for feed corn is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ months} - 8 \\text{ months} = 4 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nEach bag of feed corn can feed one cow for 1 month or one sheep for 2 months. Therefore, we need to calculate the total amount of feed corn needed for the cows and the sheep separately.\n\nFor the cows:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ cows} \\times 4 \\text{ months} = 20 \\text{ cow-months} \\]\nSince each bag of feed corn feeds one cow for 1 month, we need 20 bags of feed corn for the cows.\n\nFor the sheep:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ sheep} \\times 4 \\text{ months} = 32 \\text{ sheep-months} \\]\nSince each bag of feed corn feeds one sheep for 2 months, we need:\n\\[ 32 \\text{ sheep-months} \\div 2 \\text{ sheep-months/bag} = 16 \\text{ bags of feed corn} \\]\n\nThe total number of bags of feed corn needed is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ bags} + 16 \\text{ bags} = 36 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Compute the total cost of the feed corn.**\n\nEach bag of feed corn costs $10, so the total cost is:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ bags} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/bag} = 360 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the rancher will need to spend \\(\\boxed{360}\\) dollars on feed corn to feed his animals each year.",

Calculate the total amount of grass consumed by the animals in one month.\n2. Determine how many months the pasture can sustain the animals before running out of grass.\n3. Calculate the amount of feed corn needed for the remaining months of the year.\n4. Compute the total cost of the feed corn.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of grass consumed by the animals in one month.**\n\nEach cow eats 2 acres of grass per month, and there are 5 cows:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ cows} \\times 2 \\text{ acres/cow} = 10 \\text{ acres/month} \\]\n\nEach sheep eats 1 acre of grass per month, and there are 8 sheep:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ sheep} \\times 1 \\text{ acre/sheep} = 8 \\text{ acres/month} \\]\n\nThe total grass consumption per month is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ acres/month} + 8 \\text{ acres/month} = 18 \\text{ acres/month} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many months the pasture can sustain the animals before running out of grass.**\n\nThe pasture contains 144 acres of grass. To find out how many months it will last, we divide the total amount of grass by the monthly consumption:\n\\[ \\frac{144 \\text{ acres}}{18 \\text{ acres/month}} = 8 \\text{ months} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the amount of feed corn needed for the remaining months of the year.**\n\nThere are 12 months in a year, and the pasture will last for 8 months. Therefore, the number of months the rancher will need to buy feed corn is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ months} - 8 \\text{ months} = 4 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of feed corn needed for each month. Each bag of feed corn can feed each cow for 1 month and each sheep for 2 months. We need to determine how many bags are required for each month.\n\nFor each month:\n- The number of bags needed to feed the cows is:\n  \\[ 5 \\text{ cows} \\div 1 \\text{ cow/bag} = 5 \\text{ bags} \\]\n- The number of bags needed to feed the sheep is:\n  \\[ 8 \\text{ sheep} \\div 2 \\text{ sheep/bag} = 4 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nThe total number of bags needed each month is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ bags} + 4 \\text{ bags} = 9 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nSince the rancher needs 9 bags each month for 4 months, the total number of bags needed for the year is:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ bags/month} \\times 4 \\text{ months} = 36 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Compute the total cost of the feed corn.**\n\nEach bag of feed corn costs $10, so the total cost is:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ bags} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/bag} = 360 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the rancher will need to spend \\(\\boxed{360}\\) dollars on feed corn to feed his animals each year.",
