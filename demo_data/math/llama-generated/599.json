        "To determine Bethany's current age, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the younger sister's current age:**\n   - In 5 years, the younger sister will be 16 years old.\n   - Therefore, her current age is:\n     \\[\n     16 - 5 = 11\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the younger sister's age three years ago:**\n   - Since her current age is 11, three years ago she was:\n     \\[\n     11 - 3 = 8\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine Bethany's age three years ago:**\n   - Three years ago, Bethany was twice the age of her younger sister.\n   - Therefore, three years ago Bethany was:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 8 = 16\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine Bethany's current age:**\n   - Since three years ago Bethany was 16, her current age is:\n     \\[\n     16 + 3 = 19\n     \\]\n\nThus, Bethany is currently \\(\\boxed{19}\\) years old.",
        "Let's define the current age of Bethany's younger sister as \\( x \\). According to the problem, in 5 years, Bethany's younger sister will be 16. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x + 5 = 16 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ x = 16 - 5 \\]\n\\[ x = 11 \\]\n\nSo, Bethany's younger sister is currently 11 years old. Three years ago, Bethany's younger sister was:\n\n\\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, three years ago, Bethany was twice the age of her younger sister. Therefore, three years ago, Bethany was:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\n\nTo find Bethany's current age, we add 3 years to her age three years ago:\n\n\\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \\]\n\nSo, Bethany is currently \\(\\boxed{19}\\) years old.",
