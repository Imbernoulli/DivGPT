        "To determine the total number of apples left after Frank's dog eats some, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of apples hanging on the tree.\n2. Identify the number of apples that have fallen to the ground.\n3. Subtract the number of apples eaten by the dog from the number of apples on the ground.\n4. Add the remaining apples on the ground to the apples hanging on the tree.\n\nLet's go through the calculations step-by-step:\n\n1. The number of apples hanging on the tree is 5.\n2. The number of apples that have fallen to the ground is 8.\n3. Frank's dog eats 3 apples off the ground. So, the number of apples left on the ground is:\n   \\[\n   8 - 3 = 5\n   \\]\n4.
