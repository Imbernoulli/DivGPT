Additionally, most experts will say that a player must be able to reach at least 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball.  Suppose a basketball player is 6 feet tall and can reach 22 inches above their head using the wingspan of their arms.  How high must this player be able to jump to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how high the basketball player must be able to jump to reach 6 inches above the rim, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the height of the rim to inches:**\n   The rim is 10 feet above the ground. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 120 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the height the player needs to reach to dunk:**\n   The player needs to reach 6 inches above the rim. Therefore, we add 6 inches to the height of the rim:\n   \\[\n   120 \\text{ inches} + 6 \\text{ inches} = 126 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the player's reach without jumping:**\n   The player is 6 feet tall. Converting this height to inches:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 72 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n   Additionally, the player can reach 22 inches above their head. Therefore, the total reach without jumping is:\n   \\[\n   72 \\text{ inches} + 22 \\text{ inches} = 94 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the required jump height:**\n   To find out how high the player must jump to reach 126 inches, we subtract the player's reach without jumping from the height needed to dunk:\n   \\[\n   126 \\text{ inches} - 94 \\text{ inches} = 32 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the player must be able to jump \\boxed{32} inches to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball.",

        "To determine how high the basketball player must be able to jump, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total height the player needs to reach to dunk the basketball.\n2. Determine the height the player can reach without jumping.\n3. Subtract the height the player can reach without jumping from the total height needed to find the required jump height.\n\nFirst, let's find the total height the player needs to reach to dunk the basketball. The rim is 10 feet above the ground, and the player needs to reach 6 inches above the rim. Therefore, the total height needed is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ feet} + 6 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nSince there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 10 feet to inches:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ feet} = 10 \\times 12 = 120 \\text{ inches} \\]\nSo, the total height needed is:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ inches} + 6 \\text{ inches} = 126 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNext, let's determine the height the player can reach without jumping. The player is 6 feet tall, and can reach 22 inches above their head with their wingspan. Therefore, the total height the player can reach without jumping is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ feet} + 22 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nAgain, we convert 6 feet to inches:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ feet} = 6 \\times 12 = 72 \\text{ inches} \\]\nSo, the total height the player can reach without jumping is:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ inches} + 22 \\text{ inches} = 94 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the height the player can reach without jumping from the total height needed to find the required jump height:\n\\[ 126 \\text{ inches} - 94 \\text{ inches} = 32 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nTherefore, the player must be able to jump \\boxed{32} inches to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball.",

        "To determine how high the basketball player must be able to jump to reach 6 inches above the rim, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the height of the rim above the ground:**\n   The rim is 10 feet above the ground.\n\n2. **Convert the height of the rim to inches:**\n   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 120 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the height the player needs to reach to dunk:**\n   The player needs to reach 6 inches above the rim:\n   \\[\n   120 \\text{ inches} + 6 \\text{ inches} = 126 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the player's reach from the ground:**\n   The player is 6 feet tall, so we convert this height to inches:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 72 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n   The player can reach 22 inches above their head with their wingspan. Therefore, their total reach from the ground is:\n   \\[\n   72 \\text{ inches} + 22 \\text{ inches} = 94 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine how high the player needs to jump:**\n   To find out how high the player must jump, we subtract their reach from the necessary height to reach 6 inches above the rim:\n   \\[\n   126 \\text{ inches} - 94 \\text{ inches} = 32 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the player must be able to jump \\(\\boxed{32}\\) inches to reach 6 inches above the rim and dunk the basketball."
