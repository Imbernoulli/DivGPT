Find out how many bottles of kombucha he can buy with the cash refund.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of bottles Henry drinks in a year.**\n\nHenry drinks 15 bottles of kombucha each month. Therefore, in one year (which has 12 months), he drinks:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ bottles/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months} = 180 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total cost of these bottles.**\n\nEach bottle costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost for 180 bottles is:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ bottles} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/bottle} = 540 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cash refund Henry receives.**\n\nHenry receives a cash refund of $0.10 per bottle. Therefore, the total cash refund for 180 bottles is:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ bottles} \\times 0.10 \\text{ dollars/bottle} = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find out how many bottles of kombucha he can buy with the cash refund.**\n\nEach bottle of kombucha costs $3.00. Therefore, the number of bottles Henry can buy with $18 is:\n\\[ 18 \\text{ dollars} \\div 3 \\text{ dollars/bottle} = 6 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nThus, after 1 year, Henry will be able to buy \\(\\boxed{6}\\) bottles of kombucha after he receives his cash refund.",

Thus, the total cost for 180 bottles is:\n   \\[\n   180 \\text{ bottles} \\times \\$3.00/\\text{bottle} = \\$540.00\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cash refund Henry receives:**\n   Henry receives a cash refund of $0.10 per bottle. Therefore, the total refund for 180 bottles is:\n   \\[\n   180 \\text{ bottles} \\times \\$0.10/\\text{bottle} = \\$18.00\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many bottles Henry can buy with the cash refund:**\n   Each bottle costs $3.00. Thus, the number of bottles Henry can buy with his $18.00 refund is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$18.00}{\\$3.00/\\text{bottle}} = 6 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, after 1 year, Henry will be able to buy \\(\\boxed{6}\\) bottles of kombucha after he receives his cash refund.",
