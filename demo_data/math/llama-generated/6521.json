        "To determine the number of students currently in the class, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial number of girls in the class.\n2. Determine the number of girls after the transfer students were admitted.\n3. Calculate the total number of students currently in the class.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial number of girls in the class.**\n\nThe problem states that the number of girls was 20% greater than the number of boys. Since there were 15 boys, we can find the number of girls by calculating 20% of 15 and adding it to 15.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} = 15 + (0.20 \\times 15) = 15 + 3 = 18\n\\]\n\nSo, initially, there were 18 girls in the class.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of girls after the transfer students were admitted.**\n\nThe problem states that the number of girls doubled after the transfer students were admitted. Therefore, we need to multiply the initial number of girls by 2.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls after transfer} = 18 \\times 2 = 36\n\\]\n\nSo, after the transfer students were admitted, there are 36 girls in the class.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of students currently in the class.**\n\nThe number of boys remained the same, which is 15. Therefore, the total number of students currently in the class is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls after the transfer.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of students} = 15 + 36 = 51\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of students currently in the class is \\(\\boxed{51}\\).",
        "To determine the current number of students in the class, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial number of girls in the class.\n2. Determine the number of girls after the transfer students were admitted.\n3. Add the number of boys and the new number of girls to get the total number of students current.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial number of girls. The problem states that the number of girls was 20% greater than the number of boys. Since there were 15 boys, we can find the number of girls as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} = 15 + 0.20 \\times 15 = 15 + 3 = 18\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of girls after the transfer students were admitted. The problem states that the number of girls doubled. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{New number of girls} = 2 \\times 18 = 36\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of boys and the new number of girls to find the total number of students current:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of students} = 15 + 36 = 51\n\\]\n\nThus, the current number of students in the class is \\(\\boxed{51}\\).",

Add the number of boys and the new number of girls to find the total number of students.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial number of girls. The problem states that the number of girls was 20% greater than the number of boys. Since there were 15 boys, we can find the number of girls by calculating 20% of 15 and adding it to 15:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} = 15 + 0.20 \\times 15 = 15 + 3 = 18\n\\]\n\nSo, initially, there were 18 girls in the class.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of girls after the transfer students were admitted. The problem states that the number of girls doubled. Therefore, we multiply the initial number of girls by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New number of girls} = 2 \\times 18 = 36\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of boys and the new number of girls to find the total number of students in the class:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of students} = \\text{Number of boys} + \\text{New number of girls} = 15 + 36 = 51\n\\]\n\nThus, the current number of students in the class is \\(\\boxed{51}\\).",

Since there were 15 boys, we can find the number of girls by calculating 20% of 15 and adding it to 15.\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of girls} = 15 + 0.20 \\times 15 = 15 + 3 = 18 \\]\n\nSo, there were initially 18 girls in the class.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of girls after the transfer students were admitted.**\n\nThe problem states that the number of girls doubled after the transfer students were admitted. Therefore, we need to multiply the initial number of girls by 2.\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of girls after transfer} = 18 \\times 2 = 36 \\]\n\nSo, there are now 36 girls in the class.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of students in the class after the transfer.**\n\nSince the number of boys remained the same at 15, we add the number of boys to the number of girls after the transfer.\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of students} = 15 + 36 = 51 \\]\n\nSo, the current number of students in the class is \\(\\boxed{51}\\).",

The number of girls is 20% greater than the number of boys. Therefore, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} = 15 + 0.20 \\times 15 = 15 + 3 = 18\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of girls after the transfer students were admitted.**\n\nLater in the year, the number of girls doubled. Therefore, we can calculate the new number of girls as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{New number of girls} = 2 \\times 18 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of students in the class after the transfer.**\n\nThe number of boys remained the same, so the number of boys is still 15. The total number of students in the class now is the sum of the number of boys and the new number of girls:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of students} = 15 + 36 = 51\n\\]\n\nThus, the current number of students in the class is \\(\\boxed{51}\\).",
        "To determine the current number of students in the class, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial number of girls in the class.\n2. Determine the number of girls after the transfer students were admitted.\n3. Add the number of boys and the updated number of girls to find the total number of students now.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial number of girls in the class.**\n\nThe problem states that the number of girls was 20% greater than the number of boys at the beginning of the academic year. Since there were 15 boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} = 15 + 0.20 \\times 15 = 15 + 3 = 18\n\\]\n\nSo, there were 18 girls at the beginning of the academic year.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of girls after the transfer students were admitted.**\n\nThe problem states that the number of girls doubled later in the year. Therefore, we can calculate the new number of girls as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New number of girls} = 2 \\times 18 = 36\n\\]\n\nSo, there are now 36 girls in the class.\n\n**Step 3: Add the number of boys and the updated number of girls to find the total number of students now.**\n\nThe number of boys remained the same at 15. Therefore, the total number of students now is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of students} = \\text{Number of boys} + \\text{New number of girls} = 15 + 36 = 51\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of students in the class now is \\boxed{51}."
