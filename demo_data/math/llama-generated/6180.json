        "To determine the total time Jeannie took for her hike, we need to calculate the time it took her to hike to Mount Overlook and the time it took her to return.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it took her to hike to Mount Overlook. She hikes 12 miles at a pace of 4 miles per hour. The formula for time is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\n\nSo, the time it took her to hike to Mount Overlook is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time to Mount Overlook} = \\frac{12 \\text{ miles}}{4 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it took her to return from Mount Overlook. She returns 12 miles at a pace of 6 miles per hour. Using the same formula for time, the time it took her to return is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time to return} = \\frac{12 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we add the time it took her to hike to Mount Overlook and the time it took her to return to find the total time of her hike:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total time} = \\text{Time to Mount Overlook} + \\text{Time to return} = 3 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Jeannie took for her hike is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]",
