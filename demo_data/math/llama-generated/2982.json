Therefore, the total amount of ink needed is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ whiteboards} \\times 20 \\text{ ml per whiteboard} = 200 \\text{ ml} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the ink.**\n\nThe cost of ink is 50 cents per ml. Therefore, the total cost of the ink is:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ ml} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars per ml} = 100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the total cost to use the whiteboards for one day is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine the total cost of ink for one day at Oakland High, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of whiteboards used:**\n   - There are 5 classes.\n   - Each class uses 2 whiteboards.\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ classes} \\times 2 \\text{ whiteboards/class} = 10 \\text{ whiteboards}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total amount of ink needed:**\n   - Each whiteboard uses 20 ml of ink per day.\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ whiteboards} \\times 20 \\text{ ml/whiteboard} = 200 \\text{ ml}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the ink:**\n   - Ink costs 50 cents per ml.\n   - First, convert dollars per ml to dollars:\n     \\[\n     50 \\text{ cents} = 0.50 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Then, multiply the total amount of ink needed by the cost per ml:\n     \\[\n     200 \\text{ ml} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/ml} = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost to use the boards for one day is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) dollars.",
