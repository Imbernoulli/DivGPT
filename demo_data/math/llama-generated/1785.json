        "To determine how much change Clive will have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of jars needed:**\n   Clive needs 80 olives, and each jar contains 20 olives. Therefore, the number of jars required is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{80 \\text{ olives}}{20 \\text{ olives/jar}} = 4 \\text{ jars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the jars:**\n   Each jar costs $1.50. Thus, the total cost for 4 jars is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ jars} \\times 1.50 \\text{ dollars/jar} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the change Clive will receive:**\n   Clive has $10 to spend. After spending $6 on the jars of olives, the change he will have is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ dollars} - 6 \\text{ dollars} = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the change Clive will have is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

        "To determine how much change Clive will have after buying the olives, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of jars of olives Clive needs to buy.\n2. Determine the total cost of the jars.\n3. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Clive has.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many jars of olives Clive needs. Since each jar contains 20 olives, we can calculate the number of jars by dividing the total number of olives needed by the number of olives per jar:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of jars} = \\frac{80 \\text{ olives}}{20 \\text{ olives/jar}} = 4 \\text{ jars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the jars. Since each jar costs $1.50, we multiply the number of jars by the cost per jar:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 4 \\text{ jars} \\times 1.50 \\text{ dollars/jar} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Clive has to find out how much change he will have:\n\\[\n\\text{Change} = 10 \\text{ dollars} - 6 \\text{ dollars} = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of change Clive will have is \\boxed{4}.",
