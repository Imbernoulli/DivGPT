Therefore, the number of cats Anthony has is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 12 = 8\n\\]\nSince Anthony has 12 animals in total and 8 of them are cats, the number of dogs Anthony has is:\n\\[\n12 - 8 = 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many cats and dogs Leonel has. Leonel has half as many cats as Anthony, so the number of cats Leonel has is:\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{2} = 4\n\\]\nLeonel has seven more dogs than Anthony, so the number of dogs Leonel has is:\n\\[\n4 + 7 = 11\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of animals Leonel has is:\n\\[\n4 + 11 = 15\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the total number of animals Anthony and Leonel have to find the overall total:\n\\[\n12 + 15 = 27\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of animals Anthony and Leonel have is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{27}\n\\]",
