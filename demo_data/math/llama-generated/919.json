        "To determine how many pounds of dog food are left after a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the daily food consumption for each dog.\n2. Calculate the daily food consumption for all three dogs.\n3. Calculate the weekly food consumption for all three dogs.\n4. Subtract the weekly food consumption from the total amount of dog food Melody bought.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the daily food consumption for each dog.**\n\nEach dog eats \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) pound of dog food twice a day. Therefore, the daily food consumption for each dog is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ pound/meal} \\times 2 \\text{ meals/day} = 1 \\text{ pound/day}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the daily food consumption for all three dogs.**\n\nSince Melody has three dogs, the daily food consumption for all three dogs is:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ pound/day/dog} \\times 3 \\text{ dogs} = 3 \\text{ pounds/day}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the weekly food consumption for all three dogs.**\n\nThere are 7 days in a week, so the weekly food consumption for all three dogs is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ pounds/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 21 \\text{ pounds/week}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the weekly food consumption from the total amount of dog food Melody bought.**\n\nMelody bought 30 pounds of dog food. After a week, the amount of dog food left is:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ pounds} - 21 \\text{ pounds} = 9 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pounds of dog food left after a week is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",

Subtract the weekly food consumption from the total amount of dog food Melody bought.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily food consumption for one dog. Each dog eats \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) pound of dog food twice a day:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ pound/meal} \\times 2 \\text{ meals/day} = 1 \\text{ pound/day}\n\\]\nSo, one dog eats 1 pound of dog food per day.\n\nNext, let's calculate the daily food consumption for all three dogs:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ pound/day/dog} \\times 3 \\text{ dogs} = 3 \\text{ pounds/day}\n\\]\nSo, all three dogs together eat 3 pounds of dog food per day.\n\nNow, let's calculate the weekly food consumption for all three dogs. There are 7 days in a week:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ pounds/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 21 \\text{ pounds/week}\n\\]\nSo, all three dogs together eat 21 pounds of dog food per week.\n\nFinally, let's subtract the weekly food consumption from the total amount of dog food Melody bought:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ pounds} - 21 \\text{ pounds} = 9 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\nSo, the number of pounds of dog food left after a week is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
