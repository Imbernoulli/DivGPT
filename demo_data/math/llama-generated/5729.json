        "Let's define the number of red marbles Brett has as \\( r \\). According to the problem, Brett has 24 more blue marbles than red marbles, so the number of blue marbles is \\( r + 24 \\). Additionally, the problem states that Brett has 5 times as many blue marbles as red marbles, so the number of blue marbles is also \\( 5r \\).\n\nWe can set up the following equation based on the two expressions for the number of blue marbles:\n\\[ r + 24 = 5r \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve this equation for \\( r \\). First, we subtract \\( r \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 24 = 4r \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 4:\n\\[ r = 6 \\]\n\nSo, Brett has \\(\\boxed{6}\\) red marbles. To verify, we calculate the number of blue marbles. If Brett has 6 red marbles, then he has \\( 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\) blue marbles. This also satisfies the condition that he has 24 more blue marbles than red marbles, since \\( 30 - 6 = 24 \\). Therefore, our solution is correct.",

According to the problem, Brett has 24 more blue marbles than red marbles, and he has 5 times as many blue marbles as red marbles. We can express the number of blue marbles as \\( 5r \\).\n\nWe can set up the following equation based on the information given:\n\\[ 5r = r + 24 \\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate \\( r \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting \\( r \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 5r - r = 24 \\]\n\\[ 4r = 24 \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( r \\) by dividing both sides by 4:\n\\[ r = \\frac{24}{4} \\]\n\\[ r = 6 \\]\n\nSo, Brett has \\(\\boxed{6}\\) red marbles.",
        "To determine how many red marbles Brett has, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( r \\) as the number of red marbles.\n- \\( b \\) as the number of blue marbles.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. Brett has 24 more blue marbles than red marbles.\n2.
