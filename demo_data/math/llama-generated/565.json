        "To determine how many packs of 10 cupcakes Jean should buy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes Jean already bought:**\n   Jean bought 4 packs of 15 cupcakes each. Therefore, the total number of cupcakes is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 15 = 60\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many more cupcakes Jean needs:**\n   Jean wants to give one cupcake each to 100 children. Since she already has 60 cupcakes, the number of additional cupcakes needed is:\n   \\[\n   100 - 60 = 40\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how many packs of 10 cupcakes are needed:**\n   Each pack contains 10 cupcakes. To find out how many packs are needed to get 40 cupcakes, we divide the number of additional cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pack:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{10} = 4\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jean should buy \\(\\boxed{4}\\) packs of 10 cupcakes.",
