        "To determine how many hours Mila needs to work to earn as much as Agnes in a month, we first need to calculate how much Agnes earns in a month. We know that Agnes works 8 hours each week and makes $15 per hour. Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate Agnes's monthly earnings as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Agnes's weekly earnings} = 8 \\text{ hours/week} \\times \\$15/\\text{hour} = \\$120/\\text{week}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Agnes's monthly earnings} = \\$120/\\text{week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = \\$480/\\text{month}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many hours Mila needs to work to earn $480. Mila makes $10 per hour, so we can find the number of hours she needs to work by dividing her monthly earnings goal by her hourly wage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mila's required hours} = \\frac{\\$480}{\\$10/\\text{hour}} = 48 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mila needs to work \\boxed{48} hours to earn as much as Agnes in a month.",
