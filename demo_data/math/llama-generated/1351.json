        "To find the average weight of all 14 men and women, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of the men.\n2. Calculate the total weight of the women.\n3. Add the total weight of the men and the total weight of the women to get the combined total weight.\n4. Divide the combined total weight by the total number of people (14) to find the average weight.\n\nLet's start with the men:\n- There are 8 men with an average weight of 190 pounds.\n- The total weight of the men is \\(8 \\times 190 = 1520\\) pounds.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total weight of the women:\n- There are 6 women with an average weight of 120 pounds.\n- The total weight of the women is \\(6 \\times 120 = 720\\) pounds.\n\nNow, we add the total weight of the men and the total weight of the women to get the combined total weight:\n- The combined total weight is \\(1520 + 720 = 2240\\) pounds.\n\nFinally, we divide the combined total weight by the total number of people (14) to find the average weight:\n- The average weight is \\(\\frac{2240}{14} = 160\\) pounds.\n\nTherefore, the average weight of all 14 men and women is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
