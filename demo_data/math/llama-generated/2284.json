Therefore, the total cost of the hamburgers is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe cost of one milkshake is $5, and Annie bought 6 milkshakes. Therefore, the total cost of the milkshakes is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we add the cost of the hamburgers and the cost of the milkshakes to find the total amount spent:\n\\[ 32 + 30 = 62 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, after buying the hamburgers and milkshakes, Annie has $70 left. Let \\( x \\) be the amount of money Annie had initially. The amount of money she had initially minus the total amount spent equals the amount of money she has left:\n\\[ x - 62 = 70 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we add 62 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 70 + 62 = 132 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Annie had at first is:\n\\[ \\boxed{132} \\]",
