        "To determine how many hours Madeline needs to work this month, we first need to calculate her total expenses and savings goal.

To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total amount she needs by her hourly wage:\n\n\\[\n2060 \\div 15\n\\]\n\nTo perform the division, we can use long division. 15 goes into 2060 a total of 137 times (since \\(15 \\times 137 = 2055\\)). There is a remainder of 5, but since we are calculating the number of hours she needs to work, we can round up to the next whole number because she cannot work a fraction of an hour to meet her goal. Therefore, she needs to work 138 hours.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{138}\n\\]",
