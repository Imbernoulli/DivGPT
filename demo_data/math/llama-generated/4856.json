        "To determine the total amount Mike will need to pay for the car, we need to calculate the interest on the loan and then add it to the original cost of the car.\n\n1. Identify the principal amount of the loan, which is $20000.\n2. Identify the interest rate, which is 15%. Convert this percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100, so the interest rate is 0.15.\n3. Calculate the interest on the loan by multiplying the principal amount by the interest rate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interest} = 20000 \\times 0.15 = 3000\n   \\]\n4. Add the interest to the principal amount of the loan to find the total amount Mike needs to pay for the loan:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total loan payment} = 20000 + 3000 = 23000\n   \\]\n5. Add the total loan payment to the amount Mike has already paid (which is $15000, since he is swapped $20000 out of $35000):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 15000 + 23000 = 38000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Mike will need to pay for the car is \\(\\boxed{38000}\\).",

Add the total loan payment to the amount Mike has already paid (or will pay without the loan, which is the remaining part of the car's cost). Since Mike has chosen to pay $20000 from the bank, the remaining part of the car's cost is $35000 - $20000 = $15000.
