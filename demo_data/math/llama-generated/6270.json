        "To determine how much time my brother and I have to get to our room without being late, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total time it takes to reach the school building:**\n   - It takes 15 minutes to arrive at the school gate.\n   - It takes another 6 minutes to get from the school gate to the school building.\n   - Therefore, the total time to reach the school building is:\n     \\[\n     15 \\text{ minutes} + 6 \\text{ minutes} = 21 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the total travel time from the total available time:**\n   - We have 30 minutes to go to school.\n   - The total travel time is 21 minutes.\n   - Therefore, the time we have left to get to our room is:\n     \\[\n     30 \\text{ minutes} - 21 \\text{ minutes} = 9 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the time we have to get to our room without being late is \\(\\boxed{9}\\) minutes.",
