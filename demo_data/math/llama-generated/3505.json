Calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.\n3. Subtract the number of people who attended from the total capacity to find out how many more people could have ridden.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people who actually attended the swim meet.**\n\n- There are 2 cars, and each car has 5 people.\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ cars} \\times 5 \\text{ people per car} = 10 \\text{ people}\n  \\]\n- There are 3 vans, and each van has 3 people.\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ vans} \\times 3 \\text{ people per van} = 9 \\text{ people}\n  \\]\n- Adding the people from the cars and the vans gives:\n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ people} + 9 \\text{ people} = 19 \\text{ people}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.**\n\n- Each car can hold a maximum of 6 people.\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ cars} \\times 6 \\text{ people per car} = 12 \\text{ people}\n  \\]\n- Each van can hold a maximum of 8 people.\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ vans} \\times 8 \\text{ people per van} = 24 \\text{ people}\n  \\]\n- Adding the capacity of the cars and the vans gives:\n  \\[\n  12 \\text{ people} + 24 \\text{ people} = 36 \\text{ people}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of people who attended from the total capacity to find out how many more people could have ridden.**\n\n- The total capacity is 36 people, and 19 people attended.\n  \\[\n  36 \\text{ people} - 19 \\text{ people} = 17 \\text{ people}\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people who could have ridden with the swim team is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",
        "To determine how many more people could have ridden with the swim team, we need to calculate the total capacity of the vehicles and then subtract the number of people who actually attended the swim meet.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the capacity of the cars:\n- Each car can hold 6 people.\n- There are 2 cars.\n- Therefore, the total capacity of the cars is \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) people.\n\nNext, let's calculate the capacity of the vans:\n- Each van can hold 8 people.\n- There are 3 vans.\n- Therefore, the total capacity of the vans is \\( 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\) people.\n\nNow, let's find the total capacity of all the vehicles combined:\n- The total capacity of the cars is 12 people.\n- The total capacity of the vans is 24 people.\n- Therefore, the total capacity of all the vehicles is \\( 12 + 24 = 36 \\) people.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of people who actually attended the swim meet:\n- There were 5 people in each car.\n- There are 2 cars.\n- Therefore, the total number of people in the cars is \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) people.\n- There were 3 people in each van.\n- There are 3 vans.\n- Therefore, the total number of people in the vans is \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) people.\n- Therefore, the total number of people who attended the swim meet is \\( 10 + 9 = 19 \\) people.\n\nFinally, let's determine how many more people could have ridden with the swim team:\n- The total capacity of all the vehicles is 36 people.\n- The total number of people who attended the swim meet is 19 people.\n- Therefore, the number of additional people who could have ridden with the swim team is \\( 36 - 19 = 17 \\) people.\n\nThus, the number of more people who could have ridden with the swim team is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",
