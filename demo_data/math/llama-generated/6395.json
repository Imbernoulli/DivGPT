Subtract this discount from the original price to get the final price:\n\\[ 125 - 10 = 115 \\]\nTherefore, the final price of Store A's smartphone is $115.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the final price of Store B's smartphone.**\n\nThe original price of Store B's smartphone is $130, and it offers a discount of 10%. First, we calculate the amount of the discount:\n\\[ 130 \\times 0.10 = 13 \\]\nSo, the discount amount is $13. Subtract this discount from the original price to get the final price:\n\\[ 130 - 13 = 117 \\]\nTherefore, the final price of Store B's smartphone is $117.\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between the final prices of the two stores.**\n\nNow, we subtract the final price of Store A's smartphone from the final price of Store B's smartphone:\n\\[ 117 - 115 = 2 \\]\nSo, Store A's smartphone is $2 cheaper than Store B's smartphone.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
