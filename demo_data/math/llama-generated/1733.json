        "To determine how many oranges Alice sold, we start by defining variables for the number of oranges each person sold. Let's say Emily sold \\( E \\) oranges. Since Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, Alice sold \\( 2E \\) oranges. According to the problem, the total number of oranges sold by both Alice and Emily is 180. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\n\\[ E + 2E = 180 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ 3E = 180 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( E \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{180}{3} = 60 \\]\n\nSo, Emily sold 60 oranges. Since Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, we calculate the number of oranges Alice sold as follows:\n\n\\[ 2E = 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of oranges Alice sold is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
