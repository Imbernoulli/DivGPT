        "To determine the total pounds of sand collected by Eden, Mary, and Iris, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of buckets each person carried.\n2. Convert the number of buckets into pounds of sand.\n3. Sum the pounds of sand collected by all three.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many buckets each person carried:\n- Eden carried 4 buckets.\n- Mary carried 3 more buckets than Eden. Therefore, Mary carried \\(4 + 3 = 7\\) buckets.\n- Iris carried 1 less bucket than Mary. Therefore, Iris carried \\(7 - 1 = 6\\) buckets.\n\nNext, we convert the number of buckets into pounds of sand. Since each bucket contains 2 pounds of sand:\n- Eden carried \\(4 \\text{ buckets} \\times 2 \\text{ pounds per bucket} = 8 \\text{ pounds}\\).\n- Mary carried \\(7 \\text{ buckets} \\times 2 \\text{ pounds per bucket} = 14 \\text{ pounds}\\).\n- Iris carried \\(6 \\text{ buckets} \\times 2 \\text{ pounds per bucket} = 12 \\text{ pounds}\\).\n\nFinally, we sum the pounds of sand collected by all three:\n\\[8 \\text{ pounds} + 14 \\text{ pounds} + 12 \\text{ pounds} = 34 \\text{ pounds}\\]\n\nThus, the total pounds of sand collected is \\(\\boxed{34}\\).",
