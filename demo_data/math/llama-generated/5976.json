Fifty vehicles went through the toll booth on Monday and the same number of vehicles drove through the toll booth on Tuesday. On each of Wednesday and Thursday, twice the number of cars that passed through the toll booth on Monday went through the toll booth. If, for the remaining of the days of the week, an equal number of vehicles passed through the toll booth, calculate the total number of cars that passed the toll both in each of the remaining days.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Divide the remaining number of cars by the number of days left in the week (which is 3 days: Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n- The number of cars that passed through the toll booth on Monday is 50.\n- The number of cars that passed through the toll booth on Tuesday is 50.\n- Therefore, the total number of cars that passed through the toll booth on Monday and Tuesday is \\(50 + 50 = 100\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of cars that passed through the toll booth on Wednesday and Thursday:\n- The number of cars that passed through the toll booth on Wednesday is \\(2 \\times 50 = 100\\).\n- The number of cars that passed through the toll booth on Thursday is \\(2 \\times 50 = 100\\).\n- Therefore, the total number of cars that passed through the toll booth on Wednesday and Thursday is \\(100 + 100 = 200\\).\n\nNow, let's subtract the total number of cars from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday from the total number of cars that passed through the toll booth in the week:\n- The total number of cars that passed through the toll booth in the week is 450.\n- The total number of cars that passed through the toll booth on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday is \\(100 + 200 = 300\\).\n- Therefore, the total number of cars that passed through the toll booth on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday is \\(450 - 300 = 150\\).\n\nFinally, let's divide the remaining number of cars by the number of days left in the week:\n- The number of days left in the week is 3.\n- Therefore, the number of cars that passed through the toll booth on each of the remaining days is \\(150 \\div 3 = 50\\).\n\nThe total number of cars that passed the toll both in each of the remaining days is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
