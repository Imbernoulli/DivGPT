        "To determine how many seconds shorter the shorter wait is, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of kids waiting for the slide.\n2. Determine the total wait time for the swings.\n3. Determine the total wait time for the slide.\n4. Find the difference between the two wait times.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of kids waiting for the slide.**\n\nThere are 3 kids waiting for the swings. Since there are twice as many kids waiting for the slide, we multiply the number of kids waiting for the swings by 2:\n\\[ 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\]\nSo, there are 6 kids waiting for the slide.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total wait time for the swings.**\n\nEach kid waits 2 minutes for the swings. First, we convert 2 minutes into seconds (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):\n\\[ 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\]\nThen, we multiply the wait time per kid by the number of kids waiting for the swings:\n\\[ 120 \\times 3 = 360 \\]\nSo, the total wait time for the swings is 360 seconds.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total wait time for the slide.**\n\nEach kid waits 15 seconds for the slide. We multiply the wait time per kid by the number of kids waiting for the slide:\n\\[ 15 \\times 6 = 90 \\]\nSo, the total wait time for the slide is 90 seconds.\n\n**Step 4: Find the difference between the two wait times.**\n\nTo find out how many seconds shorter the shorter wait is, we subtract the total wait time for the slide from the total wait time for the swings:\n\\[ 360 - 90 = 270 \\]\nSo, the shorter wait is 270 seconds shorter.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{270} \\]",

Determine the total waiting time for the swings.\n3. Determine the total waiting time for the slide.\n4. Find the difference in waiting times between the swings and the slide.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of kids waiting for the slide. There are twice as many kids waiting for the slide as there are waiting for the swings. Since there are 3 kids waiting for the swings, the number of kids waiting for the slide is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\]\n\nNext, we determine the total waiting time for the swings. Each kid waits 2 minutes for the swings. Since there are 3 kids, the total waiting time for the swings is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 2 \\text{ minutes} = 6 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nWe convert this time into seconds because we want the final answer in seconds. Since 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds, the total waiting time for the swings in seconds is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNow, we determine the total waiting time for the slide. Each kid waits 15 seconds for the slide. Since there are 6 kids, the total waiting time for the slide is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 15 \\text{ seconds} = 90 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference in waiting times between the swings and the slide. The difference is:\n\\[ 360 \\text{ seconds} - 90 \\text{ seconds} = 270 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the shorter wait is \\(\\boxed{270}\\) seconds shorter.",
