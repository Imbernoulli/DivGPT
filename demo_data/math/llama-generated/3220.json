Therefore, we calculate the number of games Helen won as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Games won by Helen} = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Susan won three times as many games as Betsy. Therefore, we calculate the number of games Susan won as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Games won by Susan} = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\n\nTo find the total number of games won by all three, we add the number of games won by Betsy, Helen, and Susan:\n\\[ \\text{Total games won} = 5 + 10 + 15 \\]\n\nAdding these together, we get:\n\\[ 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of games won by Betsy, Helen, and Susan is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",
