Each one orders a different ice cream. Camille orders a banana split, her husband orders a waffle bowl, her daughter orders a single cone, and her son orders a double cone. The cone has 1 scoop of ice cream, the banana split has 3 times as many scoops of ice cream as the cone and the waffle bowl has 1 more scoop than the banana split.

        "To determine the total number of scoops of ice cream served, we need to calculate the number of scoops for each type of ice cream ordered and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Single Cone**: The single cone has 1 scoop of ice cream.\n2. **Double Cone**: The double cone has 2 scoops of ice cream (since it is double the single cone).\n3. **Banana Split**: The banana split has 3 times as many scoops as the single cone. Since the single cone has 1 scoop, the banana split has \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\) scoops.\n4. **Waffle Bowl**: The waffle bowl has 1 more scoop than the banana split.
