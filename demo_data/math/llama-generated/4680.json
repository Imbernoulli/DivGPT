        "To determine how many Lego sets Tonya buys for her older sister, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the dolls for her younger sister.\n2. Determine how much money Tonya spends on each sister.\n3.

Now, we need to determine how many Lego sets she buys for her older sister. Each Lego set costs \\$20, so we divide the total amount she spends on her older sister by the cost of each Lego set:\n\\[\n\\$60 \\div \\$20 \\text{ per Lego set} = 3 \\text{ Lego sets}\n\\]\nTherefore, Tonya buys \\(\\boxed{3}\\) Lego sets for her older sister.",
