        "To determine the distance between Andy's house and the market, we need to break down the total distance he walks step by step.\n\n1. Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school.\n2. After school, he walks back home, which is another 50 meters.\n3. Then, he walks to the market.\n\nThe total distance Andy walks is given as 140 meters.
