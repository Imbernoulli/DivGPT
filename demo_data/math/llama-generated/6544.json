Since there are 6 people, the total cost for the entrées is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 10 = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the unlimited drink tickets.**\n\nHalf of the people buy unlimited drink tickets. Since there are 6 people, half of them is:\n\\[ \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ people} \\]\nEach person pays $30 for the unlimited drink tickets.
