        "To determine the age of Mason's father, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.\n\n1. We know Mason is 20 years old.\n2. The problem states that Mason is three times younger than Sydney. This means Sydney is three times older than Mason. Therefore, we can calculate Sydney's age as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sydney's age} = 3 \\times \\text{Mason's age} = 3 \\times 20 = 60\n   \\]\n3. The problem also states that Sydney is six years younger than Mason's father. This means Mason's father is six years older than Sydney. Therefore, we can calculate Mason's father's age as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mason's father's age} = \\text{Sydney's age} + 6 = 60 + 6 = 66\n   \\]\n\nThus, Mason's father is \\(\\boxed{66}\\) years old.",
        "To determine Mason's father's age, we start by finding Sydney's age based on the information given about Mason's age. We know that Mason is three times younger than Sydney, which means Sydney is three times older than Mason. Since Mason is 20 years old, we calculate Sydney's age as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sydney's age} = 3 \\times \\text{Mason's age} = 3 \\times 20 = 60\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find Mason's father's age. We know that Sydney is six years younger than Mason's father, so Mason's father is six years older than Sydney. Therefore, we calculate Mason's father's age as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mason's father's age} = \\text{Sydney's age} + 6 = 60 + 6 = 66\n\\]\n\nThus, Mason's father is \\(\\boxed{66}\\) years old.",
