He cut the wood to 143 cm, but it is too long to fit in the bookshelf he is making. He decides to cut 25 cm off the board. But it turned out longer than the other boards. He had to cut off 7 cm from each to make them the same size. How long were the boards before he cut the 7 cm off?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the original length of the boards before Tom cut off the 7 cm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial length of the wood after the first cut.\n2. Subtract the amount cut off in the second cut.\n3. Add back the 7 cm that was cut off in the third cut to find the original length.\n\nLet's go through the steps in detail:\n\n1. Tom initially cuts the wood to 143 cm.\n2. He then cuts off 25 cm from the 143 cm piece. So, the length of the wood after the second cut is:\n   \\[\n   143 - 25 = 118 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n3. After the second cut, Tom cuts off 7 cm from each board to make them the same size. Since we are asked to find the original length of the boards before this last cut, the original length of the boards was:\n   \\[\n   118 + 7 = 125 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the original length of the boards before he cut off the 7 cm off is \\(\\boxed{125}\\).",

Therefore, the length of the board before he cut off the 7 cm is:\n\n\\[ 118 \\text{ cm} + 7 \\text{ cm} = 125 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nSo, the length of the boards before he cut the 7 cm off is \\(\\boxed{125}\\).",

        "To determine the length of the boards before Tom cut off the 7 cm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial length of the wood after the first cut.\n2. Subtract the 25 cm that Tom cut off.\n3. Add back the 7 cm that Tom cut off after realizing it was too long.\n\nLet's go through the calculations step by step:\n\n1. The initial length of the wood after the first cut is 143 cm.\n2. Tom cuts off 25 cm, so the length becomes:\n   \\[\n   143 - 25 = 118 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n3. Tom then cuts off 7 cm because the board is still too long, so the length becomes:\n   \\[\n   118 + 7 = 125 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the boards before he cut off the 7 cm was \\(\\boxed{125}\\) cm.",
        "To determine the original length of the boards before Tom cut off the 7 cm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Cut**: Tom initially cut the wood to 143 cm.\n2. **First Adjustment**: He cut off 25 cm because it was too long.\n   \\[\n   143 \\text{ cm} - 25 \\text{ cm} = 118 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n   So, after the first adjustment, the board is 118 cm long.\n3. **Second Adjustment**: Tom then cut off 7 cm from each board to make them the same size.\n   \\[\n   118 \\text{ cm} + 7 \\text{ cm} = 125 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the board was 125 cm long before he cut off the 7 cm.\n\nThus, the original length of the boards beforeeng the 7 cm off hydro \\(\\boxed{125}\\).",
        "To determine the original length of the boards before Tom cut off the 7 cm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial length of the wood Tom cut: 143 cm.\n2. Tom cut off 25 cm from the wood, so the length after this cut is:\n   \\[\n   143 - 25 = 118 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n3. Tom then cut off 7 cm from each board to make them the same size. Therefore, the length of the board before this final cut was:\n   \\[\n   118 + 7 = 125 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the length of the boards before Tom cut off the 7 cm was \\(\\boxed{125}\\) cm.",
        "To determine the original length of the board before Tom cut off the 7 cm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial length of the board Tom cut the wood to, which is 143 cm.\n2. Tom cuts off 25 cm from the board, so the new length is:\n   \\[\n   143 - 25 = 118 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n3. Tom then cuts off 7 cm from the board to make it the same size as the other boards.
