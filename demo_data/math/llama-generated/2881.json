        "To determine the total number of fruit salads in both Angel's and Alaya's restaurants, we start by finding out how many fruit salads Angel's restaurant has. According to the problem, Angel's restaurant makes twice the number of fruit salads as Alaya's restaurant. Since Alaya's restaurant has 200 fruit salads, we can calculate the number of fruit salads in Angel's restaurant as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fruit salads in Angel's restaurant} = 2 \\times 200 = 400\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the number of fruit salads in both restaurants to find the total number of fruit salads:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of fruit salads} = \\text{Number of fruit salads in Alaya's restaurant} + \\text{Number of fruit salads in Angel's restaurant} = 200 + 400 = 600\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruit salads in the two restaurants is \\boxed{600}."
