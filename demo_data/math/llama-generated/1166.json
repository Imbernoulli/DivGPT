        "To determine how much money Bert made on the sale, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the cost price of the barrel.\n2. Calculate the tax Bert has to pay.\n3. Subtract the cost price and the tax from the selling price to find out the profit.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost price of the barrel. The client bought the barrel for $90, and Bert sells products for $10 more than he buys them. Therefore, if we subtract $10 from the selling price, we get the cost price:\n\\[ \\text{Cost price} = 90 - 10 = 80 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the tax Bert has to pay. The tax is 10% of the selling price:\n\\[ \\text{Tax} = 0.10 \\times 90 = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we can find out how much money Bert made by subtracting the cost price and the tax from the selling price:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 90 - 80 - 9 = 1 \\text{ dollar} \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money Bert made on this sale is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]",
        "To determine how much money Bert made on the sale of the barrel, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the original cost of the barrel to Bert.\n2. Calculate the tax Bert has to pay.\n3. Subtract the tax from the profit Bert makes from the sale.\n\nFirst, let's find out the original cost of the barrel to Bert. Since Bert sells his products for $10 more than what he pays, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ \\text{Selling Price} = \\text{Original Cost} + 10 \\]\nWe know the selling price is $90, so:\n\\[ 90 = \\text{Original Cost} + 10 \\]\nSubtract 10 from both sides to find the original cost:\n\\[ \\text{Original Cost} = 90 - 10 = 80 \\]\nSo, Bert paid $80 for the barrel.\n\nNext, we calculate the profit Bert makes from the sale before tax. The profit is the selling price minus the original cost:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 90 - 80 = 10 \\]\n\nThen, we need to calculate the tax Bert has to pay. The tax is 10% of the selling price:\n\\[ \\text{Tax} = 0.10 \\times 90 = 9 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the tax from the profit to find out how much money Bert made:\n\\[ \\text{Money Made} = 10 - 9 = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Bert made on this sale is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]",

        "To determine how much money Bert made on the sale of the barrel, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the cost price of the barrel.\n2. Calculate the tax Bert has to pay.\n3. Subtract the tax from the profit to find out how much Bert made.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost price of the barrel. The client bought the barrel for $90, and Bert sells his products for $10 more than what he pays. Therefore, if we let the cost price be \\( x \\), then the selling price is \\( x + 10 \\). We know the selling price is $90, so we can set up the equation:\n\\[ x + 10 = 90 \\]\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ x = 80 \\]\nSo, the cost price of the barrel is $80.\n\nNext, we calculate the tax Bert has to pay. The tax is 10% of the selling price. The selling price is $90, so the tax is:\n\\[ 0.10 \\times 90 = 9 \\]\nSo, the tax Bert has to pay is $9.\n\nNow, we calculate the profit Bert makes before paying the tax. The profit is the selling price minus the cost price:\n\\[ 90 - 80 = 10 \\]\nSo, the profit before tax is $10.\n\nFinally, we subtract the tax from the profit to find out how much money Bert made:\n\\[ 10 - 9 = 1 \\]\nSo, the amount of money Bert made on this sale is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]",
        "To determine how much money Bert made on the sale of the barrel, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the original cost of the barrel to Bert:**\n   Bert sells the barrel for $90, and he sells each product for $10 more than he buys it. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Selling price} = \\text{Cost price} + 10\n   \\]\n   Given that the selling price is $90, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n   \\[\n   90 = \\text{Cost price} + 10\n   \\]\n   Solving for the cost price, we subtract 10 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost price} = 90 - 10 = 80\n   \\]\n   So, the original cost of the barrel to Bert is $80.\n\n2. **Calculate the tax Bert has to pay:**\n   Bert has to pay 10% of the value of the barrel in tax. Therefore, we calculate 10% of $90:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tax} = 0.10 \\times 90 = 9\n   \\]\n   So, the tax Bert has to pay is $9.\n\n3. **Determine Bert's profit:**\n   Bert's profit is the difference between the selling price and the total cost (which includes the cost price and the tax). Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = \\text{Selling price} - (\\text{Cost price} + \\text{Tax})\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 90 - (80 + 9) = 90 - 89 = 1\n   \\]\n   So, Bert's profit is $1.\n\nThus, the amount of money Bert made on this sale is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",

Therefore, the tax is:\n\\[ 90 \\times 0.10 = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe profit Bert makes from the sale is the selling price minus the cost price:\n\\[ 90 - 80 = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAfter subtracting the tax from the profit, the amount of money Bert made is:\n\\[ 10 - 9 = 1 \\text{ dollar} \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Bert made on this sale is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]",
        "To determine how much money Bert made on the sale of the barrel, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the original cost of the barrel:**\n   Bert sells the barrel for $90, which is $10 more than what he paid.
