        "To determine the profit from selling 25 charm bracelets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of materials for 25 bracelets:**\n   - The cost of the string for one bracelet is $1.\n   - The cost of the beads for one bracelet is $3.\n   - Therefore, the total cost of materials for one bracelet is:\n     \\[\n     1 + 3 = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - For 25 bracelets, the total cost of materials is:\n     \\[\n     25 \\times 4 = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 25 bracelets:**\n   - The selling price of each bracelet is $6.\n   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 25 bracelets is:\n     \\[\n     25 \\times 6 = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the profit:**\n   - Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost of materials from the total revenue:\n     \\[\n     150 - 100 = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the profit from selling 25 charm bracelets is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
        "To determine the profit from selling 25 charm bracelets, we need to calculate both the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between the two.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total revenue.

Since each bracelet is sold for $6 and you sell 25 bracelets, the total revenue is:\n\\[\n25 \\text{ bracelets} \\times \\$6 \\text{ per bracelet} = \\$150\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost. The cost includes the cost of the string and the cost of the beads for each bracelet. The cost of the string is $1 per bracelet, and the cost of the beads is $3 per bracelet.

The cost to produce each bracelet is the sum of the cost of the string and the cost of the beads. The cost of the string is $1 per bracelet and the cost of the beads is $3 per bracelet, so the total cost per bracelet is:\n\\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nIf you sell 25 bracelets, the total cost of production is:\n\\[ 25 \\times 4 = 100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue. The revenue from selling each bracelet is $6, so if you sell 25 bracelets, the total revenue is:\n\\[ 25 \\times 6 = 150 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe profit is the total revenue minus the total cost of production.
