        "To determine how fast Pete can walk backwards, we need to follow the given relationships between the speeds of Pete, Susan, and Tracy. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine Tracy's cartwheeling speed:**\n   - Pete can walk on his hands at 2 miles per hour.\n   - Pete can walk on his hands at one quarter the speed that Tracy can do cartwheels.\n   - Therefore, Tracy's cartwheeling speed is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Tracy's cartwheeling speed} = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ miles per hour}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine Susan's walking speed:**\n   - Tracy does one-handed cartwheels twice as fast as Susan walks forwards.\n   - Therefore, Susan's walking speed is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Susan's walking speed} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\text{ miles per hour}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine Pete's backwards walking speed:**\n   - Pete walks backwards three times faster than Susan walks forwards.\n   - Therefore, Pete's backwards walking speed is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Pete's backwards walking speed} = 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\text{ miles per hour}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the speed at which Pete can walk backwards is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.",
        "To determine how fast Pete can walk backwards, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Tracy's cartwheeling speed:**\n   Pete walks on his hands at 2 miles per hour, and he can walk on his hands only one quarter the speed that Tracy can do cartwheels. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pete's hand-walking speed} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\text{Tracy's cartwheeling speed}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given value:\n   \\[\n   2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\text{Tracy's cartwheeling speed}\n   \\]\n   Solving for Tracy's cartwheeling speed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tracy's cartwheeling speed} = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Susan's walking speed:**\n   Tracy does one-handed cartwheels twice as fast as Susan walks forwards.

Therefore, we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pete's backward-walking speed} = 3 \\times \\text{Susan's walking speed}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the value we found for Susan's walking speed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pete's backward-walking speed} = 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the speed at which Pete can walk backwards is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour.",
