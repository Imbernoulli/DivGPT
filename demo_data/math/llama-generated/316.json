        "To determine how many points Lola's team has to score in their next game to bring their cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the points scored in each game.\n2. Calculate the total points scored so far.\n3. Determine the target total points.\n4. Find out how many points are needed in the next game.\n\nFirst, let's denote the points scored at the first away game as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the team scored twice as many points at their last home game as they did at their first away game. Since they scored 62 points at their last home game, we have:\n\\[ 2x = 62 \\]\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[ x = \\frac{62}{2} = 31 \\]\n\nNext, we know that at the second away game, they scored eighteen points more than the previous away game. Therefore, the points scored at the second away game are:\n\\[ x + 18 = 31 + 18 = 49 \\]\n\nAt the third away game, they scored two more points than at their second away game. Therefore, the points scored at the third away game are:\n\\[ 49 + 2 = 51 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total points scored so far by adding the points from all the games:\n\\[ 62 + 31 + 49 + 51 \\]\n\nAdding these together step by step:\n\\[ 62 + 31 = 93 \\]\n\\[ 93 + 49 = 142 \\]\n\\[ 142 + 51 = 193 \\]\n\nThe team has scored 193 points so far. The target total points is four times the score from their last home game:\n\\[ 4 \\times 62 = 248 \\]\n\nTo find out how many points are needed in the next game, we subtract the total points scored so far from the target total points:\n\\[ 248 - 193 = 55 \\]\n\nTherefore, Lola's team has to score \\(\\boxed{55}\\) points in their next game to bring their cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game.",

Therefore, we can find the score at the first away game by dividing 62 by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Points at first away game} = \\frac{62}{2} = 31\n\\]\n\nNext, we know the team scored 18 points more at the second away game than at the first away game. So, we add 18 to the points scored at the first away game:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Points at second away game} = 31 + 18 = 49\n\\]\n\nAt the third away game, the team scored 2 points more than at the second away game. So, we add 2 to the points scored at the second away game:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Points at third away game} = 49 + 2 = 51\n\\]\n\nNow, we have the points scored at each game:\n- Last home game: 62 points\n- First away game: 31 points\n- Second away game: 49 points\n- Third away game: 51 points\n\nTo find the total points scored so far, we add these values together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total points so far} = 62 + 31 + 49 + 51 = 193\n\\]\n\nThe team wants to have a cumulative total of four times the score from their last home game. Since they scored 62 points at their last home game, four times this score is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 62 = 248\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many more points they need to score in their next game to reach a total of 248 points, we subtract the total points scored so far from 248:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Points needed in next game} = 248 - 193 = 55\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Lola's team needs to score \\boxed{55} points in their next game to bring their cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game.",
        "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Determine the score at the first away game. We know that the score at the last home game is 62 points, and it is twice the score of the first away game. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\text{(first away game score)} = 62\n   \\]\n   Solving for the first away game score, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{(first away game score)} = \\frac{62}{2} = 31\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the score at the second away game. The score at the second away game is 18 points more than the score at the first away game. Therefore, we can calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{(second away game score)} = 31 + 18 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. Determine the score at the third away game. The score at the third away game is 2 points more than the score at the second away game. Therefore, we can calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{(third away game score)} = 49 + 2 = 51\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the total score of the team after the three away games and the last home game. We add the scores of all these games:\n   \\[\n   31 + 49 + 51 + 62 = 193\n   \\]\n\n5. Determine the target cumulative score after the next game. The team wants their cumulative points to be four times the score from their last home game. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 62 = 248\n   \\]\n\n6. Determine the score needed in the next game to achieve the target cumulative score. We subtract the current total score from the target cumulative score:\n   \\[\n   248 - 193 = 55\n   \\]\n\nSo, the team needs to score \\(\\boxed{55}\\) points in their next game to bring their cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game.",

The cumulative points after the next game will be:\n\\[ 193 + y \\]\nWe want this to equal 248, so:\n\\[ 193 + y = 248 \\]\nSolving for \\( y \\):\n\\[ y = 248 - 193 = 55 \\]\n\nTherefore, Lola's team has to score \\(\\boxed{55}\\) points in their next game to bring their cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game.",
        "To determine how many points Lola's team has to score in their next game to bring their cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the points scored at each away game:**\n   - At the last home game, the team scored 62 points.\n   - The team scored twice at many points at their last home game than their first away game. Therefore, the points scored at the first away game is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{62}{2} = 31\n     \\]\n   - At the second away game, they scored eighteen points more than the previous away game. Therefore, the points scored at the second away game is:\n     \\[\n     31 + 18 = 49\n     \\]\n   - At the third away game, they scored two more points than at their second away game.

Therefore, the target cumulative points is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 62 = 248\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the points needed in the next game:**\n   - To find out how many points they need to score in their next game, we subtract the total points scored so far from the target cumulative points:\n     \\[\n     248 - 193 = 55\n     \\]\n\nThus, Lola's team has to score \\(\\boxed{55}\\) points in their next game to bring their cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game.",

        "Let's start by determining the points scored by Lola's team at each game. We know that they scored 62 points at their last home game. According to the problem, this score is twice the score of their first away game. Therefore, we can find the score of their first away game by dividing 62 by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Points at first away game} = \\frac{62}{2} = 31\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that at the second away game, they scored eighteen points more than at their first away game. Therefore, we can find the score of their second away game by adding 18 to 31:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Points at second away game} = 31 + 18 = 49\n\\]\n\nAt the third away game, they scored two more points than at their second away game. Therefore, we can find the score of their third away game by adding 2 to 49:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Points at third away game} = 49 + 2 = 51\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total points scored by the team so far. This is the sum of the points scored at their last home game and at their three away games:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total points so far} = 62 + 31 + 49 + 51 = 193\n\\]\n\nThe problem asks how many points they need to score in their next game to bring their cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game. First, we calculate four times the score of their last home game:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 62 = 248\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many points they need to score in their next game, we subtract the total points they have already scored from 248:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Points needed next game} = 248 - 193 = 55\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of points they need to score in their next game to bring their cumulative points up to four times the score from their last home game is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{55}\n\\]"
