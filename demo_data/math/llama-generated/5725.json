        "To determine how much meat the Meat Market sold beyond their original plans, we need to calculate the total amount of ground beef sold over the four days and then compare it to the original plan of 500 kg.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of ground beef sold each day:\n\n- On Thursday, they sold 210 kg.\n- On Friday, they sold twice the amount sold on Thursday. Therefore, the amount sold on Friday is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 210 = 420 \\text{ kg}\n  \\]\n- On Saturday, they sold 130 kg.\n- On Sunday, they sold half of what they sold on Saturday. Therefore, the amount sold on Sunday is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{130}{2} = 65 \\text{ kg}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we sum up the amounts sold over the four days:\n\\[\n210 + 420 + 130 + 65\n\\]\n\nLet's add these step by step:\n\\[\n210 + 420 = 630\n\\]\n\\[\n630 + 130 = 760\n\\]\n\\[\n760 + 65 = 825\n\\]\n\nThe total amount of ground beef sold over the four days is 825 kg.\n\nNow, we compare this total to the original plan of 500 kg to find out how much more they sold than planned:\n\\[\n825 - 500 = 325\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the Meat Market sold \\(\\boxed{325}\\) kg of meat beyond their original plans.",
