        "To determine the number of cats received by the animal shelter, we start by defining variables for the number of cats and dogs. Let's denote the number of dogs by \\( d \\) and the number of cats by \\( c \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of animals received is 60. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ c + d = 60 \\]\n\nWe are also given that the number of cats is 20 more than the number of dogs. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ c = d + 20 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( c + d = 60 \\)\n2. \\( c = d + 20 \\)\n\nWe can substitute the expression for \\( c \\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\\[ (d + 20) + d = 60 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\\[ 2d + 20 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( d \\) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2d = 40 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( d \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ d = 20 \\]\n\nNow that we know the number of dogs is 20, we can find the number of cats by substituting \\( d = 20 \\) back into the second equation:\n\\[ c = 20 + 20 \\]\n\\[ c = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cats received by the animal shelter is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
