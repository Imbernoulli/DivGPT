        "To determine Melony's total profit from selling 7 shirts and 3 pairs of sandals, we need to calculate the profit from each item separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find out the profit Melony makes from selling shirts. We know that she makes $21 profit for every 3 shirts. To find out how much profit she makes from selling 7 shirts, we can set up a proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit from 7 shirts} = \\left(\\frac{7}{3}\\right) \\times 21\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit from 7 shirts} = \\frac{7 \\times 21}{3} = \\frac{147}{3} = 49\n\\]\n\nSo, Melony makes $49 profit from selling 7 shirts.\n\nNext, let's find out the profit Melony makes from selling sandals. We know that she makes four times as much profit when she sells two pairs of sandals as she does when she sells 3 shirts. Since she makes $21 profit from selling 3 shirts, she makes:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 21 = 84\n\\]\n\nprofit from selling two pairs of sandals. To find out how much profit she makes from selling 1 pair of sandals, we divide $84 by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit from 1 pair of sandals} = \\frac{84}{2} = 42\n\\]\n\nSo, Melony makes $42 profit from selling 1 pair of sandals. To find out how much profit she makes from selling 3 pairs of sandals, we multiply $42 by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit from 3 pairs of sandals} = 42 \\times 3 = 126\n\\]\n\nSo, Melony makes $126 profit from selling 3 pairs of sandals.\n\nFinally, we add the profit from the shirts and the profit from the sandals to get the total profit:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total profit} = 49 + 126 = 175\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total profit Melony will make if she sells 7 shirts and 3 pairs of sandals is \\boxed{175}.",
