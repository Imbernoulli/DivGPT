        "To determine Mary's current age, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.\n\nLet's denote Mary's current age as \\( M \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, in four years, Suzy will be twice Mary's age at that time. Suzy's current age is 20, so in four years, she will be \\( 20 + 4 = 24 \\) years old. At that time, Mary will be \\( M + 4 \\) years old. The relationship between their ages in four years is given by the equation:\n\\[ 24 = 2(M + 4) \\]\n\nNext, we solve this equation step by step. First, we expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 24 = 2M + 8 \\]\n\nThen, we isolate the term with \\( M \\) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 24 - 8 = 2M \\]\n\\[ 16 = 2M \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( M \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ M = \\frac{16}{2} \\]\n\\[ M = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mary's current age is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

According to the problem, in four years, Suzy's age will be twice Mary's age at that time. Therefore, in four years, Mary's age will be \\( m + 4 \\). The relationship between their ages in four years can be expressed with the equation:\n\\[ 24 = 2(m + 4) \\]\n\nNext, we solve this equation step by step. First, we expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 24 = 2m + 8 \\]\n\nThen, we isolate the term with \\( m \\) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 24 - 8 = 2m \\]\n\\[ 16 = 2m \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( m \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ m = \\frac{16}{2} \\]\n\\[ m = 8 \\]\n\nThus, Mary's current age is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
