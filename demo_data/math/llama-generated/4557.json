To find out how many ounces each part represents, we divide the amount of Coke by the number of parts it corresponds to:\n\n\\[\\frac{6 \\text{ ounces}}{2 \\text{ parts}} = 3 \\text{ ounces per part}\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of each ingredient in the drink:\n- Coke: \\(2 \\text{ parts} \\times 3 \\text{ ounces per part} = 6 \\text{ ounces}\\)\n- Sprite: \\(1 \\text{ part} \\times 3 \\text{ ounces per part} = 3 \\text{ ounces}\\)\n- Mountain Dew: \\(3 \\text{ parts} \\times 3 \\text{ ounces per part} = 9 \\text{ ounces}\\)\n\nTo find the total volume of the drink, we add the volumes of all the ingredients together:\n\n\\[6 \\text{ ounces} + 3 \\text{ ounces} + 9 \\text{ ounces} = 18 \\text{ ounces}\\]\n\nTherefore, the total volume of the drink is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{18}\\]",
        "To determine the total volume of the drink, we need to understand the ratio of the components and then use the given amount of Coke to find the total volume.\n\nThe ratio of the components in the drink is:\n- 2 parts Coke\n- 1 part Sprite\n- 3 parts Mountain Dew\n\nFirst, we find the total number of parts in the ratio:\n\\[\n2 + 1 + 3 = 6 \\text{ parts}\n\\]\n\nWe know that 2 parts of the drink correspond to 6 ounces of Coke. To find the volume of one part, we divide the volume of Coke by the number of parts it represents:\n\\[\n\\text{Volume of one part} = \\frac{6 \\text{ ounces}}{2 \\text{ parts}} = 3 \\text{ ounces per part}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the volume of each component using the volume of one part:\n- Coke: \\(2 \\text{ parts} \\times 3 \\text{ ounces per part} = 6 \\text{ ounces}\\)\n- Sprite: \\(1 \\text{ part} \\times 3 \\text{ ounces per part} = 3 \\text{ ounces}\\)\n- Mountain Dew: \\(3 \\text{ parts} \\times 3 \\text{ ounces per part} = 9 \\text{ ounces}\\)\n\nFinally, we sum the volumes of all the components to find the total volume of the drink:\n\\[\n\\text{Total volume} = 6 \\text{ ounces (Coke)} + 3 \\text{ ounces (Sprite)} + 9 \\text{ ounces (Mountain Dew)} = 18 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total volume of the drink is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]",
