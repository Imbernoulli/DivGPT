Add the total amount of change to the amount he spent on shirts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of change Dennis received. Dennis received 2 $10 bills and $3 in loose coins. The value of the 2 $10 bills is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the $3 in loose coins to the $20, we get:\n\\[ 20 + 3 = 23 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we add the total amount of change to the amount Dennis spent on shirts. Dennis spent $27 on shirts, so we add $23 to $27:\n\\[ 27 + 23 = 50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Dennis initially had is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",
