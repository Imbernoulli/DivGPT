        "To determine how much Jill made over three months, we need to calculate her earnings for each month separately and then sum them up.\n\n**First Month:**\nJill makes $10 per day.

However, she only works every other day. Therefore, she works:\n\\[ \\frac{30 \\text{ days}}{2} = 15 \\text{ days} \\]\nHer total earnings for the third month are:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 15 \\text{ days} = 300 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Total Earnings Over Three Months:**\nTo find the total earnings over the three months, we sum up the earnings from each month:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ dollars} + 600 \\text{ dollars} + 300 \\text{ dollars} = 1200 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, Jill made \\(\\boxed{1200}\\) dollars over the three months.",
