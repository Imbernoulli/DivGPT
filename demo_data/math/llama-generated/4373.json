        "To determine by how much Scott, Mary, and Ken have exceeded their goal of raising $4,000, we need to calculate the total amount of money they have collected based on the information given.\n\nFirst, we know that Ken has $600. According to the problem, Mary's collection is five times what Ken has. Therefore, we can calculate Mary's collection as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Mary's collection} = 5 \\times \\text{Ken's collection} = 5 \\times 600 = 3000\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Mary's collection is three times Scott's funds. Therefore, we can calculate Scott's collection as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Scott's collection} = \\frac{\\text{Mary's collection}}{3} = \\frac{3000}{3} = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of money collected by adding the collections of Scott, Mary, and Ken:\n\\[\n\\text{Total collection} = \\text{Scott's collection} + \\text{Mary's collection} + \\text{Ken's collection} = 1000 + 3000 + 600 = 4600\n\\]\n\nTo find out by how much they have exceeded their goal, we subtract the goal from the total collection:\n\\[\n\\text{Excess amount} = \\text{Total collection} - \\text{Goal} = 4600 - 4000 = 600\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the three have exceeded their goal by \\boxed{600}.",
