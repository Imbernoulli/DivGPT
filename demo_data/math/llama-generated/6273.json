        "To determine the total number of students at the middle school, we start with the information that 64 seventh graders represent 32% of the total student population. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of students at the school. We can set up the following equation based on the given percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.32x = 64 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.32:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{64}{0.32} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 200 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of students at the school is 200. Next, we need to find out how many of these students are sixth graders. We know that the sixth gradersCommission 38% of the total student population. Therefore, we calculate the number of sixth graders as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of sixth graders} = 0.38 \\times 200 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of sixth graders} = 76 \\]\n\nThus, the number of sixth graders at the middle school is \\(\\boxed{76}\\).",
