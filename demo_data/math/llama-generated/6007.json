        "To determine how long it will take Chase to travel from Granville to Salisbury, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Danielle's speed:**\n   Danielle takes 30 minutes to travel from Granville to Salisbury. Let's denote the distance between Granville and Salisbury as \\( D \\) miles. Therefore, Danielle's speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Danielle's speed} = \\frac{D}{30} \\text{ miles per minute}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Cameron's speed:**\n   Danielle drives at three times the speed of Cameron. Let \\( v \\) be Cameron's speed in miles per minute. Then:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Danielle's speed} = 3v\n   \\]\n   Since we already know Danielle's speed:\n   \\[\n  3v = \\frac{D}{30}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( v \\):\n   \\[\n   v = \\frac{D}{90} \\text{ miles per minute}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Chase's speed:**\n   Cameron drives at twice the speed of Chase.
