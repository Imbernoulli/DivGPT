        "To determine how many towels Jane, Kyla, and Anthony can fold together in one hour, we need to calculate each person's folding rate in towels per minute and then sum these rates.\n\nFirst, let's find Jane's folding rate:\n- Jane can fold 3 towels in 5 minutes.\n- To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of towels by the number of minutes:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Jane's rate} = \\frac{3 \\text{ towels}}{5 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.6 \\text{ towels per minute}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's find Kyla's folding rate:\n- Kyla can fold 5 towels in 10 minutes.\n- To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of towels by the number of minutes:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Kyla's rate} = \\frac{5 \\text{ towels}}{10 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.5 \\text{ towels per minute}\n  \\]\n\nThen, let's find Anthony's folding rate:\n- Anthony can fold 7 towels in 20 minutes.\n- To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of towels by the number of minutes:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Anthony's rate} = \\frac{7 \\text{ towels}}{20 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.35 \\text{ towels per minute}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the rates to find the total folding rate when they work together:\n\\[\n\\text{Total rate} = 0.6 \\text{ towels per minute} + 0.5 \\text{ towels per minute} + 0.35 \\text{ towels per minute} = 1.45 \\text{ towels per minute}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate how many towels they can fold in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total rate by 60:\n\\[\n\\text{Total towels in one hour} = 1.45 \\text{ towels per minute} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = 87 \\text{ towels}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of towels Jane, Kyla, and Anthony can fold in one hour is \\(\\boxed{87}\\).",
