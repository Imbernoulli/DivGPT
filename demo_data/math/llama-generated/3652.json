Calculate the cost of the medium apples:\n   Donny bought 6 medium apples, and each medium apple costs $2.\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ medium apples} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per medium apple} = \\$12\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the cost of the big apples:\n   Donny bought 8 big apples, and each big apple costs $3.\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ big apples} \\times \\$3 \\text{ per big apple} = \\$24\n   \\]\n\n4. Add the costs of the small apples, medium apples, and big apples to find the total cost:\n   \\[\n   \\$9 + \\$12 + \\$24 = \\$45\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Donny will have to pay \\(\\boxed{45}\\) dollars for all the apples.",
