        "To determine how much Johnny pays for the ping pong balls after the discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the ping pong balls before the discount.\n2. Determine the discount amount.\n3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the ping pong balls before the discount.**\n\nThe cost of each ping pong ball is $0.10, and Johnny buys 10000 ping pong balls. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:\n\\[ 10000 \\times 0.10 = 1000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the discount amount.**\n\nJohnny gets a 30% discount. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 30% of the total cost before the discount:\n\\[ 1000 \\times 0.30 = 300 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount.**\n\nThe final amount Johnny pays is the total cost before the discount minus the discount amount:\n\\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Johnny pays is:\n\\[ \\boxed{700} \\]",

To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 30% (or 0.30):\n\\[ 1000 \\times 0.30 = 300 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount Johnny pays.**\n\nThe final amount Johnny pays is the total cost before the discount minus the discount amount:\n\\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Johnny pays is \\(\\boxed{700}\\).",
        "To determine how much Johnny pays for the ping pong balls, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the ping pong balls without the discount.\n2. Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.\n3. Find out the final amount Johnny pays.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the ping pong balls without the discount. The cost per ping pong ball is $0.10, and Johnny buys 10000 ping pong balls. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 10000 \\times 0.10 = 1000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Johnny pays 70% of the original total cost. To find out how much he pays, we multiply the total cost by 0.70:\n\\[ 1000 \\times 0.70 = 700 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the amount Johnny pays is:\n\\[ \\boxed{700} \\]",
