        "To determine how many clay pots Nancy created on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of clay pots created on Monday and Tuesday.\n2. Use the total number of clay pots at the end of the week to find out how many were created on Wednesday.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many clay pots Nancy created on Tuesday. She created twice as many on Tuesday as she did on Monday. Since she created 12 clay pots on Monday, the number of clay pots created on Tuesday is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, let's denote the number of clay pots created on Wednesday as \\( x \\). According to the problem, by the end of the week, Nancy had a total of 50 clay pots. This total is the sum of the clay pots created on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and the remaining clay pots she had before the week started (which is 0 in this case). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 12 + 24 + x = 50 \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 36 + x = 50 \\]\n\\[ x = 50 - 36 \\]\n\\[ x = 14 \\]\n\nSo, Nancy created \\(\\boxed{14}\\) clay pots on Wednesday.",

On Tuesday, she created twice as many as on Monday:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ clay pots} \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of clay pots created on Monday and Tuesday:\n\\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \\text{ clay pots} \\]\n\nLet \\( w \\) represent the number of clay pots Nancy created on Wednesday. According to the problem, by the end of the week she had a total of 50 clay pots. Therefore, the sum of the clay pots created on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is equal to 50:\n\\[ 36 + w = 50 \\]\n\nTo find \\( w \\), we subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ w = 50 - 36 \\]\n\\[ w = 14 \\]\n\nThus, Nancy created \\(\\boxed{14}\\) clay pots on Wednesday.",
        "To determine how many clay pots Nancy created on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of clay pots created on Tuesday.\n2. Let the number of clay pots created on Wednesday be denoted by \\( x \\).\n3. Add up the clay pots created from Monday to Wednesday and set the total equal to 50.\n4. Solve for \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of clay pots created on Tuesday. Nancy creates twice as many clay pots on Tuesday as she did on Monday. Since she created 12 clay pots on Monday, the number of clay pots created on Tuesday is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, let the number of clay pots created on Wednesday be \\( x \\). According to the problem, the total number of clay pots created by the end of the week is 50. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\\[ 12 + 24 + x + 0 = 50 \\]\nThe term \"0\" for Thursday and Friday indicates that no clay pots were created on those days. Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 36 + x = 50 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 50 - 36 \\]\n\\[ x = 14 \\]\n\nThus, Nancy created \\(\\boxed{14}\\) clay pots on Wednesday.",

Solve the equation for the variable.\n\nFirst, we know that Nancy created 12 clay pots on Monday.

Add up the clay pots created from Monday to Wednesday and set it equal to the total number of clay pots she had at the end of the week.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many clay pots Nancy created on Tuesday. According to the problem, she created twice as many clay pots on Tuesday as she did on Monday. Since she created 12 clay pots on Monday, the number of clay pots created on Tuesday is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, let the number of clay pots created on Wednesday be \\( x \\). The total number of clay pots created from Monday to Wednesday is:\n\\[ 12 + 24 + x \\]\n\nWe know that at the end of the week, Nancy had 50 clay pots. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 12 + 24 + x = 50 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\). First, add the number of clay pots created on Monday and Tuesday:\n\\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\\[ 36 + x = 50 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 50 - 36 \\]\n\\[ x = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, Nancy created \\(\\boxed{14}\\) clay pots on Wednesday.",

On Tuesday, she created twice as many as on Monday:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\nSo, she created 24 clay pots on Tuesday.\n\nNext, let's denote the number of clay pots Nancy created on Wednesday as \\( x \\).

Therefore, the sum of the clay pots created on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is equal to 50:\n\\[ 12 + 24 + x = 50 \\]\n\nNow, we can simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 36 + x = 50 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 50 - 36 \\]\n\\[ x = 14 \\]\n\nSo, Nancy created \\(\\boxed{14}\\) clay pots on Wednesday.",

The total number of clay pots created by Nancy for the week is the sum of the clay pots created on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. We know that by the end of the week she had 50 clay pots.

Add up the total number of clay pots created from Monday to Wednesday and set it equal to the total number of clay pots created by the end of the week.\n4. Solve for the variable.\n\nFirst, we know that Nancy created 12 clay pots on Monday. On Tuesday, she created twice as many as on Monday:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nLet the number of clay pots created on Wednesday be \\( x \\). By the end of the week, Nancy had a total of 50 clay pots. Therefore, the sum of the clay pots created on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is equal to 50:\n\\[ 12 + 24 + x = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we combine the known quantities:\n\\[ 36 + x = 50 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 50 - 36 \\]\n\\[ x = 14 \\]\n\nSo, Nancy created \\(\\boxed{14}\\) clay pots on Wednesday.",
