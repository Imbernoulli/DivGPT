Determine the new investment amount after Sam invests more money to have three times the amount from the first step.\n3. Calculate the amount Sam has after the next year with a 15% return on his new investment.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount after 3 years.**\n\nThe formula for the amount after \\( n \\) years with annual compounding interest is:\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + r\\right)^n \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is the principal, \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate, and \\( n \\) is the number of years.\n\nHere, \\( P = 10,000 \\), \\( r = 0.20 \\), and \\( n = 3 \\).\n\\[ A = 10,000 \\left(1 + 0.20\\right)^3 = 10,000 \\left(1.20\\right)^3 = 10,000 \\times 1.728 = 17,280 \\]\n\nSo, after 3 years, Sam has $17,280.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the new investment amount.**\n\nSam invests more money to have three times as much as $17,280.\n\\[ \\text{New investment amount} = 3 \\times 17,280 = 51,840 \\]\n\nSo, Sam now has $51,840 invested.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the amount after the next year.**\n\nThe next year, Sam gets a 15% return on his investment.

Determine the new investment amount after he triples the amount from the first 3 years.\n3. Calculate the amount of money Sam has after one year with the new investment at 15% interest compounded annually.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount after 3 years.**\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- \\( n \\) is the number of times interest is compounded per year.\n- \\( t \\) is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nSince the interest is compounded annually, \\( n = 1 \\). The formula simplifies to:\n\\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values (\\( P = 10000 \\), \\( r = 0.20 \\), \\( t = 3 \\)):\n\\[ A = 10000 (1 + 0.20)^3 = 10000 (1.20)^3 \\]\n\nCalculating \\( (1.20)^3 \\):\n\\[ (1.20)^3 = 1.20 \\times 1.20 \\times 1.20 = 1.728 \\]\n\nSo:\n\\[ A = 10000 \\times 1.728 = 17280 \\]\n\nAfter 3 years, Sam has $17,280.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the new investment amount.**\n\nSam invests more money until he has three times the amount he had after the first 3 years. Therefore, the new investment amount is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 17280 = 51840 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the amount after one year with the new investment at 15% interest compounded annually.**\n\nUsing the compound interest formula again, with \\( P = 51840 \\), \\( r = 0.15 \\), \\( n = 1 \\), and \\( t = 1 \\):\n\\[ A = 51840 (1 + 0.15)^1 = 51840 \\times 1.15 \\]\n\nCalculating \\( 51840 \\times 1.15 \\):\n\\[ 51840 \\times 1.15 = 59616 \\]\n\nAfter one year, Sam has $59,616.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Sam has now is:\n\\[ \\boxed{59616} \\]",
