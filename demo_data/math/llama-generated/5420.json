Calculate the amount of money Uncle Bradley wants to change into $50 bills.\n   Uncle Bradley wants to change \\( \\frac{3}{10} \\) of the $1000 bill into $50 bills.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{10} \\times 1000 = 300\n   \\]\n   So, Uncle Bradley wants to change $300 into $50 bills.\n\n2. Calculate the amount of money Uncle Bradley wants to change into $100 bills.\n   The rest of the money will be changed into $100 bills. Since the total amount of money is $1000 and $300 is already changed into $50 bills, the rest is:\n   \\[\n   1000 - 300 = 700\n   \\]\n   So, Uncle Bradley wants to change $700 into $100 bills.\n\n3. Determine the number of $50 bills.\n   To find out how many $50 bills make up $300, we divide $300 by $50:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{300}{50} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, Uncle Bradley will have 6 $50 bills.\n\n4. Determine the number of $100 bills.\n   To find out how many $100 bills make up $700, we divide $700 by $100:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{700}{100} = 7\n   \\]\n   So, Uncle Bradley will have 7 $100 bills.\n\n5. Add the number of $50 bills and $100 bills together.\n   \\[\n   6 + 7 = 13\n   \\]\n   So, Uncle Bradley will have a total of 13 pieces of bills.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]",

Add the number of $50 bills and $100 bills together.\n\nFirst, we calculate how much money Uncle Bradley wants to change into $50 bills. Since he wants to change \\( \\frac{3}{10} \\) of the $1000 bill into $50 bills, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{10} \\times 1000 = 300\n\\]\nSo, Uncle Bradley wants to change $300 into $50 bills.\n\nNext, we calculate how much money Uncle Bradley wants to change into $100 bills. Since he wants to change the rest of the money into $100 bills, we subtract the amount he wants to change into $50 bills from the total amount of money:\n\\[\n1000 - 300 = 700\n\\]\nSo, Uncle Bradley wants to change $700 into $100 bills.\n\nNow, we determine the number of $50 bills. Since each $50 bill is worth $50, we divide the amount of money to be changed into $50 bills by $50:\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{50} = 6\n\\]\nSo, Uncle Bradley will have 6 pieces of $50 bills.\n\nNext, we determine the number of $100 bills. Since each $100 bill is worth $100, we divide the amount of money to be changed into $100 bills by $100:\n\\[\n\\frac{700}{100} = 7\n\\]\nSo, Uncle Bradley will have 7 pieces of $100 bills.\n\nFinally, we add the number of $50 bills and $100 bills together to find the total number of bills:\n\\[\n6 + 7 = 13\n\\]\nSo, Uncle Bradley will have \\(\\boxed{13}\\) pieces of bills in all.",
