        "To determine how much more Bucky needs to save before he can buy the game, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of trout and blue-gill Bucky caught this Sunday.\n2. Determine the total amount of money Bucky earned this Sunday.\n3. Add the money earned this Sunday to the money he earned last weekend.\n4. Subtract the total amount of money he has from the cost of the video game to find out how much more he needs to save.\n\nLet's start with step 1. Bucky caught five fish this Sunday, and 60% of them were trout. So, the number of trout he caught is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 0.60 = 3 \\]\nThe rest of the fish were blue-gill, so the number of blue-gill he caught is:\n\\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of money Bucky earned this Sunday. He earns $5 from each trout and $4 from each blue-gill. Therefore, the total amount of money he earned this Sunday is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 5 + 2 \\times 4 = 15 + 8 = 23 \\]\n\nNow, we add the money earned this Sunday to the money he earned last weekend. Last weekend, he earned $35, so the total amount of money he has now is:\n\\[ 35 + 23 = 58 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount of money he has from the cost of the video game to find out how much more he needs to save. The cost of the video game is $60, so the amount he still needs to save is:\n\\[ 60 - 58 = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, Bucky needs to save \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more dollars before he can buy the game.",

Subtract the total amount of money he has from the cost of the video game to find out how much more he needs to save.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Bucky caught five fish this Sunday, and 60% of them were trout. Therefore, the number of trout he caught is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 0.60 = 3 \\]\nThe rest of the fish were blue-gill, so the number of blue-gill he caught is:\n\\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how much money Bucky earned from the trout and blue-gill he caught this Sunday. He earns $5 from each trout and $4 from each blue-gill. Therefore, the money he earned from the trout is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\nThe money he earned from the blue-gill is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\nSo, the total money he earned this Sunday is:\n\\[ 15 + 8 = 23 \\]\n\nNow, we add the money he earned this Sunday to the money he earned last weekend. Last weekend he earned $35, so the total amount of money he has now is:\n\\[ 35 + 23 = 58 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount of money he has from the cost of the video game to find out how much more he needs to save. The cost of the video game is $60, so the amount he still needs to save is:\n\\[ 60 - 58 = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, Bucky needs to save \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more dollars before he can buy the game.",

        "To determine how much more money Bucky needs to save before he can buy the game, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

Determine how much more money Bucky needs to save.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of trout and blue-gill Bucky caught this Sunday.**\n\nBucky caught a total of 5 fish this Sunday. According to the problem, 60% of the fish were trout. Therefore, the number of trout is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 0.60 = 3 \\]\nThe rest of the fish were blue-gill. So, the number of blue-gill is:\n\\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much money Bucky earned this Sunday.**\n\nBucky earns $5 for each trout and $4 for each blue-gill. Therefore, the money earned from trout is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\nThe money earned from blue-gill is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\nThe total money earned this Sunday is:\n\\[ 15 + 8 = 23 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Bucky has saved so far.**\n\nBucky earned $35 last weekend and $23 this Sunday. Therefore, the total amount of money he has saved so far is:\n\\[ 35 + 23 = 58 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine how much more money Bucky needs to save.**\n\nThe cost of the video game is $60. Therefore, the amount of money Bucky still needs to save is:\n\\[ 60 - 58 = 2 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
