        "To determine the total number of glass panels in the house, we need to consider the number of glass panels in each type of window and then sum them up for all the windows in the house.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of glass panels in the double windows downstairs:\n- Each double window has 2 windows.\n- Each window has 4 glass panels.\n- Therefore, each double window has \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) glass panels.\n\nSince there are 6 double windows downstairs, the total number of glass panels in the double windows is:\n\\[6 \\times 8 = 48\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of glass panels in the single windows upstairs:\n- Each single window has 1 window.\n- Each window has 4 glass panels.\n- Therefore, each single window has \\(1 \\times 4 = 4\\) glass panels.\n\nSince there are 8 single windows upstairs, the total number of glass panels in the single windows is:\n\\[8 \\times 4 = 32\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of glass panels from the double windows downstairs and the single windows upstairs to get the total number of glass panels in the whole house:\n\\[48 + 32 = 80\\]\n\nThus, the total number of glass panels in the whole house is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
