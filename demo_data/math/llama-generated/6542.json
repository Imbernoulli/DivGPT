        "To determine how many times a day Sandra should feed the puppies, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of portions needed per day:**\n   Sandra has 105 portions of formula for 5 days. Therefore, we divide the total number of portions by the number of days to find out how many portions are needed each day.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{105 \\text{ portions}}{5 \\text{ days}} = 21 \\text{ portions per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of portions needed per puppy per day:**\n   There are 7 puppies, and they need a total of 21 portions per day. To find out how many portions each puppy needs per day, we divide the total number of portions per day by the number of puppies.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21 \\text{ portions per day}}{7 \\text{ puppies}} = 3 \\text{ portions per puppy per day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many times a day Sandra should feed the puppies:**\n   If each puppy needs 3 portions per day, and each feeding consists of one portion, Sandra needs to feed each puppy 3 times a day.\n\nThus, Sandra should feed the puppies \\boxed{3} times a day.",

So, we divide the total number of portions by the number of days:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{105 \\text{ portions}}{5 \\text{ days}} = 21 \\text{ portions per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the total number of portions of formula needed per puppy per day.\n   Sandra has 7 puppies, so we divide the total number of portions per day by the number of puppies:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21 \\text{ portions per day}}{7 \\text{ puppies}} = 3 \\text{ portions per puppy per day}\n   \\]\n\n3. Find out how many times a day Sandra should feed each puppy.\n   Since each puppy needs 3 portions per day and each feeding consists of one portion per puppy, Sandra should feed the puppies 3 times a day.\n\nTherefore, the number of times a day Sandra should feed the puppies is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

        "To determine how many times a day Sandra should feed the puppies, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of portions needed per day:**\n   Sandra has 105 portions of formula for 5 days. Therefore, the total number of portions needed per day is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{105 \\text{ portions}}{5 \\text{ days}} = 21 \\text{ portions per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of portions needed per puppy per day:**\n   There are 7 puppies, and they need a total of 21 portions per day. Therefore, the number of portions needed per puppy per day is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21 \\text{ portions per day}}{7 \\text{ puppies}} = 3 \\text{ portions per puppy per day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of times a day Sandra should feed the puppies:**\n   If each puppy needs 3 portions per day, and each feeding consists of one portion per puppy, then Sandra needs to feed the puppies 3 times a day.\n\nThus, the number of times a day Sandra should feed the puppies is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
