The amount used to make fruit juice is 90 kg, and the amount given to a restaurant is 60 kg. Therefore, the amount of apples left for sale is:\n\\[ 405 \\text{ kg} - 90 \\text{ kg} - 60 \\text{ kg} = 255 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many bags of apples were sold.**\n\nEach bag contains 5 kg of apples. So, the number of bags sold is:\n\\[ \\frac{255 \\text{ kg}}{5 \\text{ kg/bag}} = 51 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the selling price per bag.**\n\nThe sale of the apples brought in $408. Therefore, the selling price per bag is:\n\\[ \\frac{408 \\text{ dollars}}{51 \\text{ bags}} = 8 \\text{ dollars/bag} \\]\n\nSo, the selling price of one bag of apples is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",
