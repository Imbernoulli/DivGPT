Subtract the calories from the cookies from the total calories Jimmy wants to consume to find out how many calories he needs from the crackers.\n3. Divide the remaining calories by the calories per cracker to find out how many crackers he needs to eat.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\nJimmy eats 7 cookies, and each cookie contains 50 calories.\n\\[ 7 \\text{ cookies} \\times 50 \\text{ calories/cookie} = 350 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the calories from the cookies from the total calories Jimmy wants to consume:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ calories} - 350 \\text{ calories} = 150 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nFinally, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per cracker to find out how many crackers he needs to eat:\n\\[ 150 \\text{ calories} \\div 15 \\text{ calories/cracker} = 10 \\text{ crackers} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jimmy needs to eat \\(\\boxed{10}\\) crackers.",
        "To determine how many crackers Jimmy needs to eat to have consumed a total of 500 calories after eating 7 cookies, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total calories from the cookies.\n2. Determine how many calories are needed from the crackers.\n3. Calculate the number of crackers needed based on the calories per cracker.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total calories from the cookies. Jimmy eats 7 cookies, and each cookie contains 50 calories. Therefore, the total calories from the cookies is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ cookies} \\times 50 \\text{ calories per cookie} = 350 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many calories are needed from the crackers to reach a total of 500 calories. We subtract the calories from the cookies from the total desired calories:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ calories} - 350 \\text{ calories} = 150 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nEach cracker contains 15 calories. To find out how many crackers Jimmy needs to eat to get 150 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per cracker:\n\\[ 150 \\text{ calories} \\div 15 \\text{ calories per cracker} = 10 \\text{ crackers} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jimmy needs to eat \\(\\boxed{10}\\) crackers to have consumed a total of 500 calories.",

Determine how many crackers Jimmy needs to eat to make up the remaining calories.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of calories Jimmy consumes from the cookies:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ cookies} \\times 50 \\text{ calories/cookie} = 350 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the calories from the cookies from the total calories Jimmy wants to consume:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ calories} - 350 \\text{ calories} = 150 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many crackers Jimmy needs to eat to make up the remaining 150 calories.
