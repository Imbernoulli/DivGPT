        "To determine how many stickers Andrew kept, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he gave away and then subtract that from the total number of stickers he initially had.\n\nFirst, we know that Daniel received 250 stickers. Fred received 120 more stickers than Daniel, so we can calculate the number of stickers Fred received as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Stickers Fred received} = 250 + 120 = 370 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of stickers Daniel and Fred received to find the total number of stickers Andrew gave away:\n\\[ \\text{Total stickers given away} = 250 + 370 = 620 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of stickers given away from the initial number of stickers Andrew had to find out how many stickers he kept:\n\\[ \\text{Stickers Andrew kept} = 750 - 620 = 130 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of stickers Andrew kept is \\(\\boxed{130}\\).",

Therefore, we can calculate the number of stickers Fred received as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Stickers Fred received} = 250 + 120 = 370\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of stickers Andrew gave to Daniel and Fred by adding the number of stickers each received:\n\\[\n\\text{Total stickers given} = 250 + 370 = 620\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of stickers given to Daniel and Fred from the total number of stickers Andrew initially had to find out how many stickers Andrew kept:\n\\[\n\\text{Stickers Andrew kept} = 750 - 620 = 130\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of stickers Andrew kept is \\boxed{130}.",
