        "To find the total age of Sam, Sue, and Kendra in 3 years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Sam's current age.\n2. Determine Sue's current age.\n3. Calculate their ages in 3 years.\n4. Sum their ages in 3 years.\n\nFirst, we know that Kendra is currently 18 years old. According to the problem, Kendra is 3 times as old as Sam. Therefore, we can find Sam's current age by dividing Kendra's age by 3:\n\\[\n\\text{Sam's current age} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Sam is twice as old as Sue. Therefore, we can find Sue's current age by dividing Sam's age by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Sue's current age} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate their ages in 3 years. We do this by adding 3 to each of their current ages:\n\\[\n\\text{Sam's age in 3 years} = 6 + 3 = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Sue's age in 3 years} = 3 + 3 = 6\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Kendra's age in 3 years} = 18 + 3 = 21\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum their ages in 3 years:\n\\[\n\\text{Total age in 3 years} = 9 + 6 + 21 = 36\n\\]\n\nThus, the total age of Sam, Sue, and Kendra in 3 years will be \\boxed{36}.",
