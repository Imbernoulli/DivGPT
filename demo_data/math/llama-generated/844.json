Since she bought 20 boxes and each box contains 5 pens, the total number of pens is:\n\\[\n20 \\times 5 = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, Lenny gave 40% of the pens to her close friends. To find out how many pens this is, we calculate 40% of 100:\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 100 = 40\n\\]\nSo, Lenny gave away 40 pens to her close friends. The number of pens left after giving some to her close friends is:\n\\[\n100 - 40 = 60\n\\]\n\nThen, Lenny gave one-fourth of the remaining pens to her classmates. To find out how many pens this is, we calculate one-fourth of 60:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 60 = 15\n\\]\nSo, Lenny gave away 15 pens to her classmates. The number of pens left after giving some to her classmates is:\n\\[\n60 - 15 = 45\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pens left for Lenny is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{45}\n\\]",
