        "To determine how many more cans of soup Kaiden needs to collect, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cans collected in the first two weeks:**\n   - Kaiden collected 158 cans in the first week.\n   - Kaiden collected 259 cans in the second week.\n   - Add these two amounts together:\n     \\[\n     158 + 259\n     \\]\n\n2. **Perform the addition:**\n   - Add the units place: \\(8 + 9 = 17\\). Write down 7 and carry over 1.\n   - Add the tens place: \\(5 + 5 = 10\\). Add the carried over 1: \\(10 + 1 = 11\\). Write down 1 and carry over 1.\n   - Add the hundreds place: \\(1 + 2 = 3\\). Add the carried over 1: \\(3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, the total number of cans collected is:\n     \\[\n     417\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many more cans are needed to reach the goal:**\n   - Kaiden's goal is to collect 500 cans.\n   - Subtract the total number of cans collected from the goal:\n     \\[\n     500 - 417\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the subtraction:**\n   - Subtract the units place: \\(0 - 7\\). Since 0 is less than 7, borrow 1 from the tens place.\n     - The tens place becomes 9 (since \\(10 - 1 = 9\\)).\n     - The units place becomes \\(10 - 7 = 3\\).\n   - Subtract the tens place: \\(9 - 1 = 8\\).\n   - Subtract the hundreds place: \\(5 - 4 = 1\\).\n   - Therefore, the number of cans still needed is:\n     \\[\n     83\n     \\]\n\nThus, Kaiden needs to collect \\(\\boxed{83}\\) more cans of soup to reach his goal.",
