        "To determine how much money is left in Mitzel's allowance after she spent $14, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the total allowance:**\n   Mitzel spent 35% of her allowance, which is equal to $14. Let's denote the total allowance by \\( A \\). We can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.35A = 14\n   \\]\n   To solve for \\( A \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.35:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{14}{0.35}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the division:\n   \\[\n   A = 40\n   \\]\n   So, Mitzel's total allowance is $40.\n\n2. **Calculate the remaining allowance:**\n   Mitzel spent $14, so the remaining allowance is the total allowance minus the amount spent:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining allowance} = 40 - 14\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the subtraction:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining allowance} = 26\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money left in Mitzel's allowance is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).",

According to the problem, 35% of her allowance is equal to $14.
