        "To determine how many square biscuits Unique can make with her 12 inches by 12 inches sheet of dough, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the area of the dough sheet.\n2. Calculate the area of one biscuit.\n3. Divide the area of the dough sheet by the area of one biscuit to find out how many biscuits can be made.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the dough sheet. The dough sheet is a square with a side length of 12 inches. The area \\( A \\) of a square is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA = \\text{side length} \\times \\text{side length}\n\\]\nSo, the area of the dough sheet is:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{dough}} = 12 \\times 12 = 144 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the area of one biscuit. Each biscuit is a square with a side length of 3 inches. Using the same formula for the area of a square, the area of one biscuit is:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{biscuit}} = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nNow, we divide the area of the dough sheet by the area of one biscuit to find out how many biscuits can be made:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of biscuits} = \\frac{A_{\\text{dough}}}{A_{\\text{biscuit}}} = \\frac{144}{9} = 16\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Unique can make \\(\\boxed{16}\\) biscuits with her dough.",
