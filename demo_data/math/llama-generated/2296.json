        "To determine the total number of customers served from 4 pm to 6 pm, we need to break down the time into peak and off-peak hours and calculate the number of customers served in each period.\n\nFirst, let's identify the peak and off-peak hours within the given time frame:\n- From 4 pm to 5 pm: off-peak hours\n- From 5 pm to 6 pm: peak hours\n\nNext, we calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in each period:\n- From 4 pm to 5 pm: there are 4 intervals (since 60 minutes / 15 minutes per interval = 4 intervals)\n- From 5 pm to 6 pm: there are 4 intervals (since 60 minutes / 15 minutes per interval = 4 intervals)\n\nNow, we calculate the number of customers served in each period:\n- Off-peak hours (4 pm to 5 pm): they serve 8 cars every 15 minutes. Therefore, the total number of customers served in this period is:\n  \\[\n  8 \\text{ cars/interval} \\times 4 \\text{ intervals} = 32 \\text{ cars}\n  \\]\n- Peak hours (5 pm to 6 pm): they serve 12 cars every 15 minutes. Therefore, the total number of customers served in this period is:\n  \\[\n  12 \\text{ cars/interval} \\times 4 \\text{ intervals} = 48 \\text{ cars}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of customers served in both periods to get the total number of customers served from 4 pm to 6 pm:\n\\[\n32 \\text{ cars} + 48 \\text{ cars} = 80 \\text{ cars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of customers served from 4 pm to 6 pm is \\boxed{80}.",
