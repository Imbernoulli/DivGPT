        "To determine the total cost of the family's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum these costs.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of the popcorn. The popcorn costs 80% of the cost of the ticket. Since the ticket costs $5, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of popcorn} = 0.80 \\times 5 = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find the cost of the soda. The soda costs 50% of the cost of the popcorn. Since the popcorn costs $4, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of soda} = 0.50 \\times 4 = 2 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for each type of item. The family bought 4 tickets, so the total cost for the tickets is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of tickets} = 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThe family bought 2 sets of popcorn, so the total cost for the popcorn is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of popcorn} = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThe family bought 4 cans of soda, so the total cost for the soda is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of soda} = 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the total costs of the tickets, popcorn, and soda to find the total amount spent:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount spent} = 20 + 8 + 8 = 36 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the family spent \\boxed{36} dollars.",

The family bought 2 sets of popcorn, and each set costs $4, so the total cost of the popcorn is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total cost of the soda. The family bought 4 cans of soda, and each can costs $2, so the total cost of the soda is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the total costs of the tickets, popcorn, and soda to find the total amount spent by the family:\n\\[\n20 + 8 + 8 = 36 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount spent by the family is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]",
        "First, let's determine the cost of the popcorn. The popcorn costs 80% of the cost of the movie ticket. Since the movie ticket costs $5, we calculate the cost of the popcorn as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of popcorn} = 0.80 \\times 5 = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's determine the cost of the soda. The soda costs 50% of the cost of the popcorn. Since the popcorn costs $4, we calculate the cost of the soda as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of soda} = 0.50 \\times 4 = 2 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for the family. The family bought 4 movie tickets, 2 sets of popcorn, and 4 cans of soda. The total cost for the movie tickets is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 5 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nThe total cost for the popcorn is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nThe total cost for the soda is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nAdding these amounts together gives the total amount spent by the family:\n\\[\n20 + 8 + 8 = 36 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount spent by the family is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]"
