Since Olga has three stripes on each shoe and she has a pair of shoes (which means two shoes), we can calculate the total number of stripes on Olga's shoes as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ stripes/shoe} \\times 2 \\text{ shoes} = 6 \\text{ stripes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of stripes on Rick's shoes. Rick has one less stripe per shoe than Olga, so he has:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ stripes/shoe} - 1 \\text{ stripe/shoe} = 2 \\text{ stripes/shoe}\n\\]\nSince Rick also has a pair of shoes, the total number of stripes on Rick's shoes is:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ stripes/shoe} \\times 2 \\text{ shoes} = 4 \\text{ stripes}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of stripes on Hortense's shoes. Hortense has double the number of stripes per shoe as Olga, so she has:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ stripes/shoe} \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ stripes/shoe}\n\\]\nSince Hortense also has a pair of shoes, the total number of stripes on Hortense's shoes is:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ stripes/shoe} \\times 2 \\text{ shoes} = 12 \\text{ stripes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the total number of stripes on all of their shoes:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ stripes} + 4 \\text{ stripes} + 12 \\text{ stripes} = 22 \\text{ stripes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the combined number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{22}\n\\]",
