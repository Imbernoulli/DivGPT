        "To determine how much John pays for 30 cans of soup with a buy 1 get 1 free deal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Deal**: Buy 1 get 1 free means for every can John buys, he gets another can for free. Therefore, for every 2 cans, he only pays for 1 can.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Paid Cans**: Since John gets 30 cans in total, we need to find out how many cans he actually pays for. Since the deal is buy 1 get 1 free, the number of paid cans is half of the total number of cans.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of paid cans} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost**: Each can costs $0.60, so the total cost for 15 paid cans is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 15 \\times 0.60 = 9.00\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, John pays \\(\\boxed{9.00}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine how much John pays for the 30 cans of soup with a buy 1 get 1 free deal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Deal**: The buy 1 get 1 free deal means that for every can John buys, he gets another can for free.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Pairs**: Since each pair consists of 2 cans, we divide the total number of cans by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n   So, John gets 15 pairs of cans.\n\n3. **Determine the Cost per Pair**: Each pair costs the price of one can because the second can is free.

Therefore, for every 2 cans, he only pays for 1 can.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of paid cans**: Since John gets 30 cans in total, we need to find out how many cans he actually pays for. Since he gets one free can for each can he buys, the number of paid cans is half of the total number of cans:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of paid cans} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost**: Each paid can costs $0.60. Therefore, the total cost for 15 paid cans is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 15 \\times 0.60 = 9.00\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total amount John pays is \\(\\boxed{9.00}\\).",
        "To determine how much John pays for the 30 cans of soup, we need to consider the \"buy 1 get 1 free\" deal. This means for every two cans he buys, he only pays for one.
