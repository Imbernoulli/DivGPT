        "To determine how many more bollards the company is required to install, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bollards required for all sides of the road.\n2.

Subtract the number of bollards installed from the total number of bollards required to find out how many more bollards are needed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of bollards required for all sides of the road. Since there are 4000 bollards required on each side and there are two sides, the total number of bollards required is:\n\\[\n4000 \\text{ bollards/side} \\times 2 \\text{ sides} = 8000 \\text{ bollards}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many bollards have already been installed. The company has installed \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the total number of bollards required. Therefore, the number of bollards installed is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 8000 = 6000 \\text{ bollards}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of bollards installed from the total number of bollards required to find out how many more bollards are needed:\n\\[\n8000 - 6000 = 2000 \\text{ bollards}\n\\]\n\nSo, the company is required to install \\(\\boxed{2000}\\) more bollards on all sides of the remaining part of the road.",
