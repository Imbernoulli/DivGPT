Determine the fuel consumption rate per kilometer.\n3. Convert the fuel consumption rate to per 100 kilometers.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount of gasoline used during the journey.**\n\nThe initial amount of gasoline in the tank is 47 liters, and after the journey, there are 14 liters left. Therefore, the amount of gasoline used is:\n\\[ 47 \\text{ liters} - 14 \\text{ liters} = 33 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the fuel consumption rate per kilometer.**\n\nThe car traveled 275 km and used 33 liters of gasoline. Therefore, the fuel consumption rate per kilometer is:\n\\[ \\frac{33 \\text{ liters}}{275 \\text{ km}} = \\frac{33}{275} \\text{ liters/km} = \\frac{33 \\div 11}{275 \\div 11} = \\frac{3}{25} \\text{ liters/km} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert the fuel consumption rate to per 100 kilometers.**\n\nTo find the fuel consumption rate per 100 km, we multiply the rate per kilometer by 100:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{25} \\text{ liters/km} \\times 100 \\text{ km} = \\frac{3 \\times 100}{25} \\text{ liters/100 km} = \\frac{300}{25} \\text{ liters/100 km} = 12 \\text{ liters/100 km} \\]\n\nTherefore, the fuel consumption of the car is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) liters per 100 km."
