        "Let's denote the total number of wall decorations Trey has as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of decorations that Trey uses nails for. Since he uses a nail for each of two-thirds of the decorations, the number of decorations with nails is:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3}x \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of decorations that Trey uses thumbtacks for. Since he uses a thumbtack for each of two-fifths of the rest of the decorations, we first need to determine how many decorations remain after using nails. The number of remaining decorations is:\n\\[ x - \\frac{2}{3}x = \\frac{1}{3}x \\]\nSo, the number of decorations with thumbtacks is:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5} \\left( \\frac{1}{3}x \\right) = \\frac{2}{15}x \\]\n\nThe number of decorations that Trey uses sticky strips for is the remainder after using nails and thumbtacks. This is:\n\\[ x - \\frac{2}{3}x - \\frac{2}{15}x = \\frac{1}{3}x - \\frac{2}{15}x = \\frac{5}{15}x - \\frac{2}{15}x = \\frac{3}{15}x = \\frac{1}{5}x \\]\nWe know that Trey used 15 sticky strips, so:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{5}x = 15 \\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 5:\n\\[ x = 15 \\times 5 = 75 \\]\nSo, the total number of wall decorations is 75.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of nails Trey used. Since he used a nail for each of two-thirds of the decorations, the number of nails is:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\times 75 = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of nails Trey used is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",

        "Let's denote the total number of wall decorations Trey has by \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of decorations that are hung using nails.
