        "To determine how many 6-inch pencils can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of a circle with a radius of 14 feet, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the diameter of the circle:**\n   The diameter \\( d \\) of a circle is twice the radius \\( r \\). Given that the radius \\( r \\) is 14 feet, we have:\n   \\[\n   d = 2 \\times 14 = 28 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert the diameter from feet to inches:**\n   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 28 feet to inches by multiplying by 12:\n   \\[\n   28 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 336 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many 6-inch pencils fit into the diameter:**\n   To find out how many 6-inch pencils can be placed end-to-end across the diameter, we divide the diameter in inches by the length of one pencil:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{336 \\text{ inches}}{6 \\text{ inches/pencil}} = 56\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of 6-inch pencils that can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of the circle is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",
