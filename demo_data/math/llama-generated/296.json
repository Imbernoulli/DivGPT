        "To determine how many more siblings Janet has than Carlos, we start by calculating the number of siblings each person has based on the information given.\n\nFirst, we find out how many siblings Janet has. According to the problem, Janet has 60 less than four times as many siblings as Masud. Since Masud has 60 siblings, we can calculate Janet's siblings as follows:\n\\[\n4 \\times 60 - 60 = 240 - 60 = 180\n\\]\nSo, Janet has 180 siblings.\n\nNext, we find out how many siblings Carlos has. The problem states that Carlos has \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) times as many siblings as Masud. Since Masud has 60 siblings, we can calculate Carlos's siblings as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 60 = \\frac{3 \\times 60}{4} = \\frac{180}{4} = 45\n\\]\nSo, Carlos has 45 siblings.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more siblings Janet has than Carlos.

According to the problem, Janet has 60 less than four times as many siblings as Masud. Since Masud has 60 siblings, we can express the number of siblings Janet has as:\n\\[ 4 \\times 60 - 60 = 240 - 60 = 180 \\]\nSo, Janet has 180 siblings.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of siblings Carlos has. According to the problem, Carlos has \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) times as many siblings as Masud. Since Masud has 60 siblings, we can express the number of siblings Carlos has as:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} \\times 60 = \\frac{3 \\times 60}{4} = \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\]\nSo, Carlos has 45 siblings.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more siblings Janet has than Carlos. This is the difference between the number of siblings Janet has and the number of siblings Carlos has:\n\\[ 180 - 45 = 135 \\]\nSo, Janet has 135 more siblings than Carlos.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{135} \\]",
        "To determine how many more siblings Janet has than Carlos, we start by finding out how many siblings each of them has based on the number of siblings Masud has.\n\nFirst, we know that Masud has 60 siblings. Let's calculate how many siblings Janet has. According to the problem, Janet has 60 less than four times as many siblings as Masud.
