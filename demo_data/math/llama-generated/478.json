        "To determine how many photos Shane took each week in February, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of photos Shane took in January.\n2. Subtract the number of photos taken in January from the total number of photos taken in the first 2 months to find out how many photos were taken in February.\n3. Determine how many weeks are in February.\n4. Divide the number of photos taken in February by the number of weeks in February to find out how many photos were taken each week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of photos Shane took in January. January has 31 days, and he takes 2 photos every day:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ photos/day} \\times 31 \\text{ days} = 62 \\text{ photos}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of photos taken in January from the total number of photos taken in the first 2 months to find out how many photos were taken in February:\n\\[\n146 \\text{ photos} - 62 \\text{ photos} = 84 \\text{ photos}\n\\]\n\nFebruary has 28 days in a typical year, which means there are 4 weeks in February:\n\\[\n28 \\text{ days} \\div 7 \\text{ days/week} = 4 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we divide the number of photos taken in February by the number of weeks in February to find out how many photos were taken each week:\n\\[\n84 \\text{ photos} \\div 4 \\text{ weeks} = 21 \\text{ photos/week}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of photos Shane took each week in February is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",

Determine how many weeks are in February and then divide the number of photos taken in February by the number of weeks to find out how many photos were taken each week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of photos Shane took in January. Since January has 31 days and he takes 2 photos each day, we have:\n\\[ 31 \\times 2 = 62 \\text{ photos} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of photos taken in January from the total number of photos taken in the first two months to find out how many photos were taken in February:\n\\[ 146 - 62 = 84 \\text{ photos} \\]\n\nFebruary has 28 days, which means there are 4 weeks in February. To find out how many photos Shane took each week in February, we divide the total number of photos taken in February by the number of weeks:\n\\[ 84 \\div 4 = 21 \\text{ photos per week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of photos Shane took each week in February is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
