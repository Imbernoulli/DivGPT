        "To determine the age of Tom's dog in six years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the current age of Tom's brother:**\n   We know that in 6 years, Tom's brother will be 30 years old. Therefore, we can find his current age by subtracting 6 from 30:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current age of Tom's brother} = 30 - 6 = 24\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the current age of Tom's dog:**\n   According to the problem, Tom's brother is 4 times as old as Tom's dog. Let \\( d \\) represent the current age of Tom's dog. We can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   24 = 4d\n   \\]\n   To solve for \\( d \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, Tom's dog is currently 6 years old.\n\n3. **Determine the age of Tom's dog in six years:**\n   To find out how old Tom's dog will be in six years, we add 6 to his current age:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Age of Tom's dog in six years} = 6 + 6 = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Tom's dog will be \\boxed{12} years old in six years.",

Let's denote the current age of Tom's dog by \\(d\\). Therefore, we can write the following equation based on the relationship between their ages:\n\n\\[\n24 = 4d\n\\]\n\nTo find the current age of Tom's dog, we solve for \\(d\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Tom's dog is currently 6 years old, we can find out how old Tom's dog will be in six years by adding 6 to the current age of the dog:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Age of Tom's dog in six years} = 6 + 6 = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, the age of Tom's dog in six years is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
