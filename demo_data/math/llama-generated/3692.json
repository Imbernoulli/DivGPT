The total capacity is the sum of the free space and the used space:\n\\[ 2.4 \\text{ GB} + 12.6 \\text{ GB} = 15 \\text{ GB} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the new amount of used space after deleting the folder of size 4.6 GB and adding new files of size 2 GB. The new used space will be:\n\\[ 12.6 \\text{ GB} - 4.6 \\text{ GB} + 2 \\text{ GB} = 10 \\text{ GB} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the free space on the current drive after these operations:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ GB} - 10 \\text{ GB} = 5 \\text{ GB} \\]\n\nWhen Sarah transfers all her files to the new external drive, the total space used will be the same as the new used space on the current drive, which is 10 GB. The new external drive has a size of 20 GB, so the free space on the new external drive will be:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ GB} - 10 \\text{ GB} = 10 \\text{ GB} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of free gigabytes on the new external drive is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",

Determine the free space on the new external drive after transferring all the files.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial total capacity of Sarah's external drive. The free space is 2.4 gigabytes and the used space is 12.6 gigabytes. Therefore, the total capacity is:\n\\[ 2.4 + 12.6 = 15 \\text{ gigabytes} \\]\n\nNext, Sarah deletes a folder of size 4.6 gigabytes. This reduces the used space by 4.6 gigabytes. So, the new used space is:\n\\[ 12.6 - 4.6 = 8 \\text{ gigabytes} \\]\n\nThen, Sarah adds new files of size 2 gigabytes. This increases the used space by 2 gigabytes. So, the new used space is:\n\\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \\text{ gigabytes} \\]\n\nNow, we can determine the new free space on the external drive. Since the total capacity is 15 gigabytes and the new used space is 10 gigabytes, the new free space is:\n\\[ 15 - 10 = 5 \\text{ gigabytes} \\]\n\nFinally, Sarah transfers all her files to a new external drive of size 20 gigabytes. The used space on the new drive will be the same as the used space on the old drive, which is 10 gigabytes.
