        "To determine the total number of nails Violet and Tickletoe have together, we start by defining the number of nails Tickletoe has. Let's denote the number of nails Tickletoe has as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, Violet has 3 more than twice as many nails as Tickletoe. This can be expressed with the equation:\n\\[ 27 = 2x + 3 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by isolating the variable. First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 27 - 3 = 2x \\]\n\\[ 24 = 2x \\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\\[ x = \\frac{24}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 12 \\]\n\nSo, Tickletoe has 12 nails. To find the total number of nails Violet and Tickletoe have together, we add the number of nails Violet has to the number of nails Tickletoe has:\n\\[ 27 + 12 = 39 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of nails they have together is \\(\\boxed{39}\\).",
