        "To determine the total weight of dumbbells Parker is using for his exercises, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of dumbbells and their weight.\n2. Add the additional dumbbells to the initial setup.\n3. Calculate the total weight of all the dumbbells.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Initially, there are 4 dumbbells, each weighing 20 pounds.\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ dumbbells} \\times 20 \\text{ pounds per dumbbell} = 80 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. Parker added 2 more dumbbells to the setup. So, the total number of dumbbells now is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ dumbbells} + 2 \\text{ dumbbells} = 6 \\text{ dumbbells}\n   \\]\n\n3. Since each dumbbell weighs 20 pounds, the total weight of all the dumbbells is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ dumbbells} \\times 20 \\text{ pounds per dumbbell} = 120 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight of dumbbells Parker is using for his exercises is \\boxed{120}.",
