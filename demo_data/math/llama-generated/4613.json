        "To determine how many questions Sasha still needs to complete, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of questions Sasha can complete in 2 hours.\n2. Subtract the number of questions completed from the total number of questions.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of questions Sasha can complete in 2 hours. Since she completes 15 questions per hour, in 2 hours she can complete:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ questions/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ questions} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of questions completed from the total number of questions.
