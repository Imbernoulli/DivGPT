        "To determine how many cookies Neil has left after giving some to his friend, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of cookies Neil gave to his friend:**\n   Neil baked a total of 20 cookies and gave \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of them to his friend. To find out how many cookies this is, we multiply the total number of cookies by \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{5} \\times 20\n   \\]\n\n   To perform the multiplication, we can multiply the numerator (2) by the total number of cookies (20), and then divide by the denominator (5):\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2 \\times 20}{5} = \\frac{40}{5} = 8\n   \\]\n\n   So, Neil gave 8 cookies to his friend.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of cookies Neil has left:**\n   Neil originally had 20 cookies. After giving away 8 cookies, the number of cookies left is:\n\n   \\[\n   20 - 8 = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies left for Neil is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",

Therefore, we multiply 20 by 2/5:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{20 \\times 2}{5} = \\frac{40}{5} = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, Neil gave 8 cookies to his friend. Now, we subtract the 8 cookies from the total 20 cookies Neil baked:\n\n\\[\n20 - 8 = 12\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies left for Neil is \\boxed{12}.",
        "To determine how many cookies Neil has left after giving some to his friend, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of cookies Neil gave to his friend:**\n\n   Neil baked a total of 20 cookies and gave 2/5 of them to his friend. To find out how many cookies this is, we multiply the total number of cookies by \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cookies given to friend} = 20 \\times \\frac{2}{5}\n   \\]\n\n   To perform the multiplication, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:\n\n   \\[\n   20 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{20 \\times 2}{5 \\times 5} = \\frac{40}{25}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{40}{25} \\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40 \\div 5}{25 \\div 5} = \\frac{8}{5} = 8\n   \\]\n\n   So, Neil gave 8 cookies to his friend.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of cookies left for Neil:**\n\n   Neil started with 20 cookies and gave away 8 cookies.
