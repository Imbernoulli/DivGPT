        "To determine the recommended number of cups of water per week for Happy, we start by calculating how many additional cups she needs to drink. Since she needs to drink 40% more water than she currently does, we first find 40% of her current water intake.\n\nThe current water intake is 15 cups per week. So, we calculate 40% of 15 as follows:\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 15 = 6 \\]\nThis means Happy needs to drink an additional 6 cups of water per week.\n\nNext, we add this additional amount to her current water intake to find the total recommended number of cups per week:\n\\[ 15 + 6 = 21 \\]\n\nTherefore, the recommended number of cups of water per week for Happy is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",

        "To find out the recommended number of cups of water per week for Happy, we start by determining how many additional cups she needs to drink. Since she needs to drink 40% more water than she currently does, we first calculate 40% of her current water intake.\n\nThe current water intake is 15 cups per week. To find 40% of 15 cups, we use the formula:\n\\[ 40\\% \\text{ of } 15 = \\frac{40}{100} \\times 15 = 0.40 \\times 15 = 6 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nThis means Happy needs to drink an additional 6 cups of water per week.
