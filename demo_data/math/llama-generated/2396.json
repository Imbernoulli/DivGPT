Therefore, we can calculate the number of cones sold on Wednesday as:\n\\[ \\text{Icream cones sold on Wednesday} = 2 \\times 12,000 = 24,000 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of cones sold on Tuesday and Wednesday to find the total number of cones sold over the two days:\n\\[ \\text{Total ice cream cones sold} = \\text{Icream cones sold on Tuesday} + \\text{Icream cones sold on Wednesday} = 12,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of ice cream cones sold is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36000} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of ice cream cones sold over the two days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of ice cream cones sold on Tuesday.\n2.

Add the number of ice cream cones sold on Tuesday to the number%\\ ice cream cones sold on Wednesday.\n\nStep 1: The number of ice cream cones sold on Tuesday is given as 12,000.\n\nStep 2: On Wednesday, the number of ice cream cones sold was double the amount sold on Tuesday. Therefore, we calculate the number of ice cream cones sold on Wednesday as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12,000 = 24,000 \\]\n\nStep 3: To find the total number of ice cream cones sold over the two days, we add the number of ice cream cones sold on Tuesday to the number of ice cream cones sold on Wednesday:\n\\[ 12,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of ice cream cones sold is \\(\\boxed{36000}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of ice cream cones sold over the two days, we start by calculating the number of ice cream cones sold on Wednesday. According to the problem, the number of ice cream cones sold on Wednesday is double the number sold on Tuesday. Since 12,000 ice cream cones were sold on Tuesday, we can calculate the number of ice cream cones sold on Wednesday as follows:\n\n\\[ 12,000 \\times 2 = 24,000 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of ice cream cones sold on Tuesday to the number of ice cream cones sold on Wednesday to find the total number of ice cream cones sold over the two days:\n\n\\[ 12,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of ice cream cones sold is \\(\\boxed{36000}\\).",
