Pete, inspired by history, decided to make his own flag.  He used circles, to represent how many scoops of ice cream he can consume in one sitting, and squares, to represent the number of brownies he has hidden beneath his bed.  For circles, he used 3 less than half the number of stars on the US flag, and for squares, he used six more than twice the number of stripes on the US flag.  What is the combined total number of circles and squares on Pete's flag?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the combined total number of circles and squares on Pete's flag, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of circles.\n2. Calculate the number of squares.\n3. Add the number of circles and squares together.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of circles. The number of circles Pete used is 3 less than half the number of stars on the US flag. The US flag has 50 stars. So, we start by finding half of 50:\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{2} = 25\n\\]\nNext, we subtract 3 from 25:\n\\[\n25 - 3 = 22\n\\]\nTherefore, Pete used 22 circles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of squares. The number of squares Pete used is 6 more than twice the number of stripes on the US flag. The US flag has 13 stripes. So, we start by finding twice the number of stripes:\n\\[\n2 \\times 13 = 26\n\\]\nNext, we add 6 to 26:\n\\[\n26 + 6 = 32\n\\]\nTherefore, Pete used 32 squares.\n\nFinally, we add the number of circles and squares together to find the combined total:\n\\[\n22 + 32 = 54\n\\]\nThus, the combined total number of circles and squares on Pete's flag is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
        "To determine the combined total number of circles and squares on Pete's flag, we start by calculating the number of circles and squares separately based on the given information about the US flag.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of circles.
