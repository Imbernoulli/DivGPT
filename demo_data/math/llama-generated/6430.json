Use the number of blue crayons to find the number of yellow crayons.\n\nFirst, we know there are 14 red crayons. The problem states that there are 5 more blue crayons than red crayons. Therefore, we can calculate the number of blue crayons as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue crayons} = \\text{Number of red crayons} + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19\n\\]\n\nNext, the problem states that there are 6 less yellow crayons than double the number of blue crayons. First, we need to find double the number of blue crayons:\n\\[\n\\text{Double the number of blue crayons} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of blue crayons} = 2 \\times 19 = 38\n\\]\nThen, we subtract 6 from this result to find the number of yellow crayons:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of yellow crayons} = \\text{Double the number of blue crayons} - 6 = 38 - 6 = 32\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of yellow crayons is \\boxed{32}.",
