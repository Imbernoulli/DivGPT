        "To determine the number of children in Monroe's family, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many granola bars are left after Monroe and her husband ate some. Monroe and her husband ate 80 granola bars out of the 200 granola bars she made. So, we subtract 80 from 200:\n   \\[\n   200 - 80 = 120\n   \\]\n   This means there are 120 granola bars left to be divided among the children.\n\n2. Next, we know that each child received 20 granola bars. To find out how many children there are, we divide the remaining granola bars by the number of granola bars each child received:\n   \\[\n   120 \\div 20 = 6\n   \\]\n   This means there are 6 children in the family.\n\nTherefore, the number of children in the family is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
