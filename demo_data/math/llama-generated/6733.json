        "To determine Jacob's current age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Phoebe's current age:**\n   - Rehana is currently 25 years old.\n   - In five years, Rehana will be \\(25 + 5 = 30\\) years old.\n   - According to the problem, in five years, Rehana will be three times as old as Phoebe.\n   - Let \\(P\\) be Phoebe's current age.\n   - In five years, Phoebe will be \\(P + 5\\) years old.\n   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     30 = 3(P + 5)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(P\\):**\n   - Distribute the 3 on the right-hand side:\n     \\[\n     30 = 3P + 15\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 15 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(P\\):\n     \\[\n     30 - 15 = 3P\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     15 = 3P\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\(P\\):\n     \\[\n     P = \\frac{15}{3}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     P = 5\n     \\]\n   - So, Phoebe is currently 5 years old.\n\n3. **Determine Jacob's current age:**\n   - Jacob is 3/5 of Phoebe's current age.\n   - Therefore, Jacob's age is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{5} \\times 5 = 3\n     \\]\n\nThus, Jacob is currently \\(\\boxed{3}\\) years old.",
        "Let's denote Phoebe's current age as \\( P \\). According to the problem, in five years, Rehana will be three times as old as Phoebe. Rehana's current age is given as 25 years old. Therefore, in five years, Rehana's age will be \\( 25 + 5 = 30 \\) years old. At that time, Phoebe's age will be \\( P + 5 \\) years old. We can set up the following equation based on the information given:\n\n\\[ 30 = 3(P + 5) \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[ 30 = 3P + 15 \\]\n\\[ 30 - 15 = 3P \\]\n\\[ 15 = 3P \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{15}{3} \\]\n\\[ P = 5 \\]\n\nSo, Phoebe's current age is 5 years old. Jacob is currently \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of Phoebe's current age. Therefore, we calculate Jacob's age as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Jacob's age} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 5 = 3 \\]\n\nThus, Jacob is currently \\(\\boxed{3}\\) years old."
