        "To determine the total number of pairs of pants and dresses that Isabella bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the number of items Alexis bought and the number of items Isabella bought. According to the problem, Alexis bought 3 times more pants and dresses than Isabella.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of items Alexis bought:\n\\[\n21 \\text{ pairs of pants} + 18 \\text{ dresses} = 39 \\text{ items}\n\\]\nSince Alexis bought 3 times more items than Isabella, we can represent the total number of items Isabella bought as \\( x \\).
