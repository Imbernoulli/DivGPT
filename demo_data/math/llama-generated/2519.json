        "To determine how many cupcakes Anna has left, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how many cupcakes Anna gives away to her classmates.\n2. Determine how many cupcakes remain after giving some away.\n3. Subtract the number of cupcakes Anna eats from the remaining cupcakes.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many cupcakes Anna gives away to her classmates. She gives away \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) of the 60 cupcakes:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5} \\times 60 = \\frac{4 \\times 60}{5} = \\frac{240}{5} = 48\n\\]\nSo, Anna gives away 48 cupcakes.\n\nNext, we determine how many cupcakes remain after giving some away. Since she started with 60 cupcakes and gave away 48, the number of remaining cupcakes is:\n\\[\n60 - 48 = 12\n\\]\n Anna then eats 3 cupcakes from the remaining 12 cupcakes. The number of cupcakes she has left after eating is:\n\\[\n12 - 3 = 9\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of cupcakes Anna has left is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",

Since she started with 60 cupcakes and gave away 48, the number of cupcakes left is:\n\\[\n60 - 48 = 12\n\\]\n Anna then eats 3 of these remaining cupcakes. Therefore, the number of cupcakes left after she eats is:\n\\[\n12 - 3 = 9\n\\]\nSo, the number of cupcakes Anna has left is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
