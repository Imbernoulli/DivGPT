        "To determine the number of passenger cars in the train, we start by defining the variables:\n- Let \\( p \\) represent the number of passenger cars.\n- Let \\( c \\) represent the number of cargo cars.\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following:\n1. The number of cargo cars is equal to half the number of passenger cars plus three.\n2. The total number of cars, including the engine and caboose, is 71.\n\nWe can express these relationships with the following equations:\n\\[\nc = \\frac{1}{2}p + 3\n\\]\n\\[\np + c + 2 = 71\n\\]\n\nFirst, we substitute the expression for \\( c \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[\np + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}p + 3\\right) + 2 = 71\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms:\n\\[\np + \\frac{1}{2}p + 3 + 2 = 71\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2}p + 5 = 71\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( p \\), we first subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2}p = 66\n\\]\n\nThen, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), which is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\):\n\\[\np = 66 \\times \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\np = 44\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of passenger cars in the train is \\(\\boxed{44}\\).\n\nTo verify, we calculate the number of cargo cars:\n\\[\nc = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 44 + 3\n\\]\n\\[\nc = 22 + 3\n\\]\n\\[\nc = 25\n\\]\n\nWe then check the total number of cars:\n\\[\np + c + 2 = 44 + 25 + 2\n\\]\n\\[\np + c + 2 = 71\n\\]\n\nThe calculations confirm that our solution is correct.
