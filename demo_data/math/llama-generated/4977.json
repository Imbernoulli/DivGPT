        "To determine how many houses can be painted in 3 hours, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the time from hours to minutes, since the painting time is given in minutes.\n2. Calculate how many 20-minute intervals fit into the total time available.\n\nFirst, we convert 3 hours into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 by 60:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many 20-minute intervals fit into 180 minutes.
