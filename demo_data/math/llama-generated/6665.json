        "To determine the new percentage of girls in the classroom after 5 new boys join, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial number of girls in the classroom.\n2. Calculate the initial number of boys in the classroom.\n3. Determine the new total number of students after the new boys join.\n4. Determine the new number of boys in the classroom.\n5. Calculate the new percentage of girls in the classroom.\n\nLet's start with the initial number of girls. The classroom has 20 students and 40% of them are girls:\n\\[ \\text{Initial number of girls} = 0.40 \\times 20 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the initial number of boys in the classroom. Since there are 20 students in total and 8 of them are girls, the number of boys is:\n\\[ \\text{Initial number of boys} = 20 - 8 = 12 \\]\n\nNow, 5 new boys join the classroom. Therefore, the new total number of students in the classroom is:\n\\[ \\text{New total number of students} = 20 + 5 = 25 \\]\n\nThe new number of boys in the classroom is:\n\\[ \\text{New number of boys} = 12 + 5 = 17 \\]\n\nThe number of girls remains the same, which is 8. To find the new percentage of girls in the classroom, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{New percentage of girls} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of girls}}{\\text{New total number of students}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{8}{25} \\right) \\times 100 = 32\\% \\]\n\nThus, the new percentage of girls in the class is:\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]",

Calculate the new percentage of girls in the classroom.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of girls currently in the classroom.**\n\nThe classroom initially has 20 students, and 40% of them are girls.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} = 20 \\times 0.40 = 8\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of students after the new boys join.**\n\nThe classroom initially has 20 students, and 5 new boys join.\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of students} = 20 + 5 = 25\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the new percentage of girls in the classroom.**\n\nThe number of girls remains the same (8), but the total number of students is now 25. The new percentage of girls is:\n\\[\n\\text{New percentage of girls} = \\left( \\frac{8}{25} \\right) \\times 100 = 32\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the new percentage of girls in the class is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
