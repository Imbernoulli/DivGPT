        "To determine how many hours Marta has worked on the farm, we need to consider all the sources of her收入. Marta has collected $240 in total, which includes her hourly wage and the tips she has received. She earns $10 for every hour she works, and she has collected $50 in tips. We can set up the following equation to represent her total earnings:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total earnings} = \\text{Hourly wage} \\times \\text{Hours worked} + \\text{Tips} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 240 = 10 \\times \\text{Hours worked} + 50 \\]\n\nTo find the number of hours Marta has worked, we first need to isolate the term involving the hours worked. We do this by subtracting $50 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 240 - 50 = 10 \\times \\text{Hours worked} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 190 = 10 \\times \\text{Hours worked} \\]\n\nNext, we solve for the number of hours worked by dividing both sides of the equation by 10:\n\n\\[ \\text{Hours worked} = \\frac{190}{10} = 19 \\]\n\nTherefore, Marta has worked \\(\\boxed{19}\\) hours on the farm so far.",

        "To determine how many hours Marta has worked on the farm, we start by considering her total earnings. Marta's total earnings consist of her collected money, her hourly wage, and her tips. We know that her total earnings are $240, her tips are $50, and her hourly wage is $10 per hour. Let's denote the number of hours Marta has worked as \\( h \\).\n\nFirst, we can express Marta's total earnings in terms of her hourly wage and tips:\n\\[ \\text{Total earnings} = \\text{Hourly wage} \\times \\text{Hours worked} + \\text{Tips} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 240 = 10h + 50 \\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate \\( h \\). We do this by first subtracting $50 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 240 - 50 = 10h \\]\n\\[ 190 = 10h \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 10:\n\\[ h = \\frac{190}{10} \\]\n\\[ h = 19 \\]\n\nTherefore, Marta has worked on the farm for \\(\\boxed{19}\\) hours."
