        "To determine how many goldfish Martin will have in 7 weeks, we need to account for the goldfish that die and the goldfish he buys each week. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of goldfish**: Martin starts with 18 goldfish.\n2. **Weekly change in the number of goldfish**: Each week, 5 goldfish die and Martin buys 3 new goldfish. Therefore, the net change in the number of goldfish each week is:\n   \\[\n   3 - 5 = -2\n   \\]\n   This means that each week the number of goldfish decreases by 2.\n\n3. **Number of weeks**: We need to find out how many goldfish Martin will have after 7 weeks. We can express the number of goldfish after 7 weeks as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial number of goldfish} + (\\text{Net change per week} \\times \\text{Number of weeks})\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we have:\n   \\[\n   18 + (-2 \\times 7) = 18 - 14 = 4\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, after 7 weeks, Martin will have \\boxed{4} goldfish.",

So, the net change in the number of goldfish each week is \\(3 - 5 = -2\\).
