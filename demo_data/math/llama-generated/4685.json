        "To determine the number of books Arlo bought, we start by understanding the given ratio of books to pens, which is 7:3. This means for every 7 books, there are 3 pens. Therefore, the total number of parts in the ratio is:\n\n\\[ 7 + 3 = 10 \\]\n\nNext, we know that the total number of stationery items (books and pens) Arlo bought is 400. Since the ratio tells us that the total number of parts is 10, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of stationery items by the total number of parts:\n\n\\[ \\text{Value of one part} = \\frac{400}{10} = 40 \\]\n\nNow, to find the number of books, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts representing books in the ratio (which is 7):\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of books} = 7 \\times 40 = 280 \\]\n\nThus, the number of books Arlo bought is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{280} \\]",
