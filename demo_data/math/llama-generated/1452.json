Each time he takes a trip to sea, he sees a different group of whales. On his first trip, he counts 28 male whales and twice as many female whales. On his second trip, he sees 8 baby whales, each travelling with their parents. On his third trip, he counts half as many male whales as the first trip and the same number of female whales as on the first trip. In total, how many whales were out at sea during Ishmael’s monitoring?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total number of whales Ishmael saw during his three trips, we need to calculate the number of whales on each trip and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of whales on Ishmael's first trip:\n- He sees 28 male whales.\n- He sees twice as many female whales as male whales. Therefore, the number of female whales is \\(2 \\times 28 = 56\\).\n- The total number of whales on the first trip is \\(28 + 56 = 84\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of whales on Ishmael's second trip:\n- He sees 8 baby whales, and each baby whale travels with its parents. Therefore, the total number of whales on the second trip is \\(8 + 2 \\times 8 = 8 + 16 = 24\\).\n\nFinally, let's calculate the number of whales on Ishmael's third trip:\n- He sees half as many male whales as on the first trip. Therefore, the number of male whales is \\(\\frac{28}{2} = 14\\).\n- He sees the same number of female whales as on the first trip, which is 56.\n- The total number of whales on the third trip is \\(14 + 56 = 70\\).\n\nNow, we sum the number of whales from all three trips:\n\\[84 + 24 + 70 = 178\\]\n\nThus, the total number of whales Ishmael saw during his monitoring is \\(\\boxed{178}\\).",
