        "To determine the number of Japanese stamps Nikka has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of Chinese stamps.\n2. Calculate the number of US stamps.\n3. Subtract the number of Chinese and US stamps from the total number of stamps to find the number of Japanese stamps.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of Chinese stamps. Nikka has 35% of her stamps as Chinese stamps. Therefore, we can find the number of Chinese stamps by multiplying the total number of stamps by 35%:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Chinese stamps} = 100 \\times \\frac{35}{100} = 100 \\times 0.35 = 35\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of US stamps. Nikka has 20% of her stamps as US stamps. Therefore, we can find the number of US stamps by multiplying the total number of stamps by 20%:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of US stamps} = 100 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 100 \\times 0.20 = 20\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of Chinese and US stamps from the total number of stamps to find the number of Japanese stamps:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Japanese stamps} = 100 - \\text{Number of Chinese stamps} - \\text{Number of US stamps} = 100 - 35 - 20 = 45\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of Japanese stamps Nikka has is \\boxed{45}.",
