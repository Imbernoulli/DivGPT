        "To determine the total amount of money Alan spent at the market, we need to calculate the cost of the eggs and the cost of the chickens separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the eggs. Alan bought 20 eggs at a price of $2 per egg. Therefore, the total cost for the eggs is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ eggs} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per egg} = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the chickens. Alan bought 6 chickens at a price of $8 per chicken. Therefore, the total cost for the chickens is:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ chickens} \\times 8 \\text{ dollars per chicken} = 48 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the eggs and the cost of the chickens to find the total amount of money Alan spent at the market:\n\\[\n40 \\text{ dollars} + 48 \\text{ dollars} = 88 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Alan spent at the market is \\boxed{88}.",
