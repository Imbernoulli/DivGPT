Aleena has 2 bars fewer than Legacy, so we can calculate the number of bars Aleena has as follows:\n\\[\n5 - 2 = 3\n\\]\nTherefore, Aleena has 3 bars of gold.\n\nNext, we add the number of bars of gold that Legacy and Aleena have together:\n\\[\n5 + 3 = 8\n\\]\nSo, together they have 8 bars of gold.\n\nSince each bar of gold is worth $2200, we can calculate the total value of the gold as follows:\n\\[\n8 \\times 2200 = 17600\n\\]\nTherefore, the total value of gold that Legacy and Aleena have together is \\(\\boxed{17600}\\).",
        "To determine the total value of gold that Legacy and Aleena have together, we start by calculating the number of gold bars each person has.\n\nFirst, we know that Legacy has 5 bars of gold.

        "To determine the total value of gold that Legacy and Aleena have together, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of gold bars Aleena has.\n2. Determine the total number of gold bars both Legacy and Aleena have.\n3. Calculate the total value of the gold bars.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many gold bars Aleena has. Aleena has 2 bars fewer than Legacy. Since Legacy has 5 bars, we can calculate the number of bars Aleena has as follows:\n\\[\n5 - 2 = 3\n\\]\nSo, Aleena has 3 bars of gold.\n\nNext, we add the number of gold bars that Legacy and Aleena have to find the total number of gold bars:\n\\[\n5 + 3 = 8\n\\]\nSo, together, Legacy and Aleena have 8 bars of gold.\n\nNow, we calculate the total value of these 8 bars of gold. Since each bar of gold is worth $2200, we multiply the number of bars by the value of each bar:\n\\[\n8 \\times 2200 = 17600\n\\]\nTherefore, the total value of gold that Legacy and Aleena have together is \\boxed{17600}.",
