        "To determine how many cookies each child gets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cookies eaten by the adults.\n2. Determine the number of cookies left after the adults have eaten.\n3. Divide the remaining cookies equally among the four children.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of cookies eaten by the adults. The adults eat \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the 120 cookies:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 120 = 40\n\\]\nSo, the adults eat 40 cookies.\n\nNext, we find out how many cookies are left after the adults have eaten. We subtract the number of cookies eaten by the adults from the total number of cookies:\n\\[\n120 - 40 = 80\n\\]\nSo, there are 80 cookies left to be divided among the four children.\n\nFinally, we divide the remaining cookies equally among the four children:\n\\[\n\\frac{80}{4} = 20\n\\]\nSo, each child gets 20 cookies.\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

Determine how many cookies are left after the adults have eaten.\n3. Divide the remaining cookies equally among the four children.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies eaten by the adults.**\n\nThe adults eat \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the cookies. Since there are 120 cookies in total, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 120 = 40\n\\]\nSo, the adults eat 40 cookies.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many cookies are left after the adults have eaten.**\n\nAfter the adults have eaten 40 cookies, the number of cookies left is:\n\\[\n120 - 40 = 80\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Divide the remaining cookies equally among the four children.**\n\nThe remaining 80 cookies are to be divided equally among the four children. Therefore, each child gets:\n\\[\n\\frac{80}{4} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, each child gets \\(\\boxed{20}\\) cookies.",
