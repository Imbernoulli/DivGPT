        "To determine how much money Maurice would make for finishing 30 tasks, we need to consider both the payment he earns for each task and the bonus he receives for every 10 tasks completed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the payment for the tasks themselves. Maurice earns $2 for each task. Since he is finishing 30 tasks, we multiply the number of tasks by the payment per task:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ tasks} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/task} = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the bonus. Maurice receives a $6 bonus for every 10 tasks completed. Since he is finishing 30 tasks, we divide the total number of tasks by the number of tasks required for each bonus:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ tasks} \\div 10 \\text{ tasks/bonus} = 3 \\text{ bonuses} \\]\nThen, we multiply the number of bonuses by the value of each bonus:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ bonuses} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars/bonus} = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the payment for the tasks and the bonus to find the total amount of money Maurice makes:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ dollars} + 18 \\text{ dollars} = 78 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Maurice would make for finishing 30 tasks is \\(\\boxed{78}\\).",
