Add the amounts of water from both water heaters.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the capacity of Catherine's water heater.**\n\nWe know that Wallace's water heater is twice the size of Catherine's water heater. The capacity of Wallace's water heater is 40 gallons. Therefore, the capacity of Catherine's water heater is:\n\\[\n\\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in Wallace's water heater.**\n\nWallace's water heater is 3/4 full. So, the amount of water in Wallace's water heater is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 40 = 30 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the amount of water in Catherine's water heater.**\n\nCatherine's water heater is also 3/4 full. So, the amount of water in Catherine's water heater is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 20 = 15 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Add the amounts of water from both water heaters.**\n\nThe total number of gallons of water that Wallace and Catherine have is:\n\\[\n30 + 15 = 45 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of gallons of water they both have is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{45}\n\\]",
