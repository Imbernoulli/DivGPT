        "To determine how many flowers Miriam can take care of in 6 days of work, we start by finding out how many flowers she can take care of in one day. According to the problem, Miriam can take care of 60 different flowers in one day.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of flowers she can take care of over 6 days. We do this by multiplying the number of flowers she can take care of in one day by the number of days she works:\n\n\\[ 60 \\text{ flowers/day} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 360 \\text{ flowers} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of flowers Miriam can take care of in 6 days is \\(\\boxed{360}\\)."
