        "Let's determine the number of passengers on the bus step by step.\n\n1. Initially, the bus starts with 0 passengers.\n2. At the first stop, 7 people get on the bus.\n   \\[\n   0 + 7 = 7\n   \\]\n   So, there are now 7 passengers on the bus.\n3. At the second stop, 3 people get off the bus, and 5 people get on the bus.\n   \\[\n   7 - 3 + 5 = 9\n   \\]\n   So, there are now 9 passengers on the bus.\n4.

        "To determine the number of passengers on the bus after all the stops, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of passengers on the bus, which is 0.\n2. Add the number of passengers getting on at the first stop.\n3. Subtract the number of passengers getting off at the second stop and then add the number of passengers getting on at the second stop.\n4. Subtract the number of passengers getting off at the third stop and then add the number of passengers getting on at the third stop.\n\nLet's go through the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Initial number of passengers: 0\n2. At the first stop, 7 people got on:\n   \\[\n   0 + 7 = 7\n   \\]\n   So, there are 7 passengers on the bus now.\n3. At the second stop, 3 people got off and 5 people got on:\n   \\[\n   7 - 3 + 5 = 9\n   \\]\n   So, there are 9 passengers on the bus now.\n4. At the third stop, 2 people got off and 4 people got on:\n   \\[\n   9 - 2 + 4 = 11\n   \\]\n   So, there are 11 passengers on the bus now.\n\nTherefore, the number of passengers now on the bus is \\boxed{11}.",
