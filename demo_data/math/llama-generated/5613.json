        "To determine how many dresses Alex can make, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of silk Alex gives to his friends:**\n   Alex gives 20 meters of silk to each of his 5 friends.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total silk given to friends} = 20 \\, \\text{meters/friend} \\times 5 \\, \\text{friends} = 100 \\, \\text{meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the amount of silk Alex has left after giving some to his friends:**\n   Alex started with 600 meters of silk.\n   \\[\n   \\text{ruits left} = 600 \\, \\text{meters} - 100 \\, \\text{meters} = 500 \\, \\text{meters}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many dresses Alex can make with the remaining silk:**\n   Each dress requires 5 meters of silk.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of dresses} = \\frac{500 \\, \\text{meters}}{5 \\, \\text{meters/dress}} = 100 \\, \\text{dresses}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of dresses Alex can make is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
        "To determine how many dresses Alex can make, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of silk Alex gives to his friends.\n2. Subtract this amount from the initial amount of silk to find out how much silk Alex has left.\n3. Determine how many dresses Alex can make with the remaining silk.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of silk Alex gives to his friends. Alex has 5 friends and he gives each friend 20 meters of silk. Therefore, the total amount of silk given to his friends is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 20 = 100 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount of silk given to his friends from the initial amount of silk to find out how much silk Alex has left:\n\\[ 600 - 100 = 500 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nEach dress requires 5 meters of silk. To find out how many dresses Alex can make with the remaining 500 meters of silk, we divide 500 by 5:\n\\[ 500 \\div 5 = 100 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of dresses Alex can make is:\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]",
