        "To determine the total number of nuts in Mason's car, we need to calculate the number of nuts each squirrel has stockpiled and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of nuts the two busy squirrels have stockpiled. Each busy squirrel stockpiles 30 nuts per day, and they have been stockpiling for 40 days. Therefore, the number of nuts each busy squirrel has stockpiled is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ nuts/day} \\times 40 \\text{ days} = 1200 \\text{ nuts} \\]\nSince there are two busy squirrels, the total number of nuts stockpiled by the busy squirrels is:\n\\[ 1200 \\text{ nuts} \\times 2 = 2400 \\text{ nuts} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of nuts the sleepy squirrel has stockpiled. The sleepy squirrel stockpiles 20 nuts per day, and they have been stockpiling for 40 days. Therefore, the number of nuts the sleepy squirrel has stockpiled is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ nuts/day} \\times 40 \\text{ days} = 800 \\text{ nuts} \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of nuts stockpiled by all the squirrels:\n\\[ 2400 \\text{ nuts} + 800 \\text{ nuts} = 3200 \\text{ nuts} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of nuts in Mason's car is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3200} \\]",
