        "To determine how many meters of ribbon will be left from Tom's ribbon after Sammy wraps all the gifts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of ribbon Sammy needs.\n2. Subtract the total amount of ribbon Sammy needs from the length of Tom's ribbon.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of ribbon Sammy needs. Sammy has 8 gifts, and each gift requires 1.5 meters of ribbon. Therefore, the total amount of ribbon needed is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 1.5 = 12 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount of ribbon Sammy needs from the length of Tom's ribbon. Tom's ribbon is 15 meters long. So, the amount of ribbon left after Sammy wraps all the gifts is:\n\\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThus, the number of meters of ribbon that will be left from Tom's ribbon is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

Subtract the total amount of ribbon Sammy needs from the length of Tom's ribbon.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of ribbon Sammy needs:\n\\[\n\\text{Total ribbon needed} = \\text{Number of gifts} \\times \\text{Ribbon per gift} = 8 \\times 1.5 = 12 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount of ribbon Sammy needs from the length of Tom's ribbon:\n\\[\n\\text{Ribbon left} = \\text{Length of Tom's ribbon} - \\text{Total ribbon needed} = 15 - 12 = 3 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of meters of ribbon that will be left from Tom's ribbon is \\boxed{3}.",

Calculate the total amount of ribbon Sammy needs to wrap all the gifts.\n2. Subtract the total amount of ribbon Sammy needs from the length of Tom's ribbon.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of ribbon Sammy needs. Sammy has 8 gifts, and each gift requires 1.5 meters of ribbon. So, we multiply the number of gifts by the length of ribbon needed per gift:\n\\[ 8 \\times 1.5 = 12 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount of ribbon Sammy needs from the length of Tom's ribbon. Tom's ribbon is 15 meters long, so we subtract 12 meters from 15 meters:\n\\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of ribbon left from Tom's ribbon is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
