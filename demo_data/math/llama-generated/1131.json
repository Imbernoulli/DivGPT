        "To determine the length of the TV show itself, not counting the commercials, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total time spent on commercials:**\n   - There are 3 commercials.\n   - Each commercial lasts 10 minutes.\n   - Total time for commercials = \\( 3 \\times 10 \\) minutes = 30 minutes.\n\n2. **Convert the total time spent on commercials from minutes to hours:**\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - Total time for commercials in hours = \\( \\frac{30}{60} \\) hours = 0.5 hours.\n\n3. **Subtract the total time spent on commercials from the total duration of the TV show:**\n   - The TV show was aired for 1.5 hours.\n   - Total time for the TV show itself = \\( 1.5 \\) hours - \\( 0.5 \\) hours = 1 hour.\n\nTherefore, the length of the TV show itself, not counting commercials, is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) hour.",

Subtract the total time spent on commercials from the total duration of the TV show.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time spent on commercials. There were 3 commercials, and each commercial lasted 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on commercials is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the total time spent on commercials from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 30 minutes by 60:\n\\[ 30 \\div 60 = 0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total time spent on commercials from the total duration of the TV show. The TV show was aired for 1.5 hours, so we subtract 0.5 hours from 1.5 hours:\n\\[ 1.5 - 0.5 = 1 \\text{ hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the TV show itself, not counting commercials, is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]",
