Karen gets a $500 bonus if their average score is above 75, plus an extra $10 bonus for every additional point the average score increases above 75. So far, Karen has graded 8 tests, and the average is 70. Given that each student can have a maximum score of 150, what combined score do the last two tests need to have for Karen to earn a $600 bonus?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the combined score the last two tests need to have for Karen to earn a $600 bonus, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the bonus structure:**\n   - Karen gets a $500 bonus if the average score is above 75.\n   - She gets an extra $10 bonus for every additional point the average score increases above 75.\n   - To earn a $600 bonus, she needs an additional $100 beyond the $500 bonus.\n   - Since each additional point above 75 gives her $10, she needs \\( \\frac{100}{10} = 10 \\) additional points above 75.\n   - Therefore, the average score must be \\( 75 + 10 = 85 \\).\n\n2. **Set up the equation for the average score:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the combined score of the last two tests.\n   - The total score of the 10 tests is the sum of the scores of the first 8 tests plus \\( x \\).\n   - The average score of the 10 tests is \\( \\frac{560 + x}{10} \\) (since the average of the first 8 tests is 70, the total score of the first 8 tests is \\( 70 \\times 8 = 560 \\)).\n   - We need this average to be 85, so we set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{560 + x}{10} = 85\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to clear the denominator:\n     \\[\n     560 + x = 850\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 560 from both sides to isolate \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 850 - 560\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 290\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the combined score the last two tests need to have for Karen to earn a $600 bonus is \\(\\boxed{290}\\).",
        "To determine the combined score needed for the last two tests for Karen to earn a $600 bonus, we start by analyzing the conditions for earning the bonus.\n\nKaren earns a $500 bonus if the average score is above 75. Additionally, she earns an extra $10 bonus for every additional point the average score increases above 75. Therefore, to earn a $600 bonus, the total bonus amount from both the base bonus and the additional bonuses must sum to $600.
