        "To determine how much money Nina made over the weekend, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of jewelry she sold and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. Calculate the revenue from necklaces:\n   Nina sold 5 necklaces, and each necklace costs $25.00.\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 25 = 125\n   \\]\n   So, the revenue from necklaces is $125.\n\n2. Calculate the revenue from bracelets:\n   Nina sold 10 bracelets, and each bracelet costs $15.00.\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 15 = 150\n   \\]\n   So, the revenue from bracelets is $150.\n\n3. Calculate the revenue from earrings:\n   Nina sold 20 pairs of earrings, and each pair costs $10.00.\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 10 = 200\n   \\]\n   So, the revenue from earrings is $200.\n\n4.
