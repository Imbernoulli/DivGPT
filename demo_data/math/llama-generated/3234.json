Divide the total number of pencils by the number of containers.\n\nFirst, we find the total number of pencils Eric has after receiving the additional pencils:\n\\[ 150 + 30 = 180 \\]\n\nNext, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of containers to find out how many pencils can be evenly distributed:\n\\[ 180 \\div 5 = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, Eric can evenly distribute \\(\\boxed{36}\\) pencils between the five containers.",
        "To determine how many pencils Eric can evenly distribute between the five containers after receiving additional pencils, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial number of pencils per container:**\n   Eric sorted 150 colored pencils into 5 containers.
