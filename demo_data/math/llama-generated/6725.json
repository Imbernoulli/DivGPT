        "To determine how many times Tammy caught the ball, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of times Derek caught the ball.\n2. Use Derek's catches to calculate the number of times Tammy caught the ball.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many times Derek caught the ball. We know that Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. Joe caught the ball 23 times. Therefore, we can calculate Derek's catches as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Derek's catches} = 2 \\times \\text{Joe's catches} - 4 = 2 \\times 23 - 4 = 46 - 4 = 42\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many times Tammy caught the ball. We know that Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. Derek caught the ball 42 times. Therefore, we can calculate Tammy's catches as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Tammy's catches} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Derek's catches} + 16 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 42 + 16 = 14 + 16 = 30\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of times Tammy caught the ball is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

So, we calculate double the catches Joe did:\n\\[ 2 \\times 23 = 46 \\]\nThen, we subtract four from this result:\n\\[ 46 - 4 = 42 \\]\nTherefore, Derek caught the ball 42 times.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many times Tammy caught the ball. The problem states that Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. So, we first calculate a third of the times Derek caught the ball:\n\\[ \\frac{42}{3} = 14 \\]\nThen, we add sixteen to this result:\n\\[ 14 + 16 = 30 \\]\nTherefore, Tammy caught the ball 30 times.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",
        "To determine how many times Tammy caught the ball, we start by calculating the number of times Derek caught the ball.
