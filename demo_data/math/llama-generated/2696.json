        "To determine the new length of the commercial after shortening it by 30%, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the original length of the commercial. The original length is 30 seconds.\n2. Calculate 30% of the original length. This will give us the amount of time that needs to be cut from the commercial.\n3. Subtract the calculated amount from the original length to find the new length of the commercial.\n\nLet's do the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Calculate 30% of 30 seconds:\n   \\[\n   30\\% \\text{ of } 30 = \\frac{30}{100} \\times 30 = 0.30 \\times 30 = 9 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n2.
