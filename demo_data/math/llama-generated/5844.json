        "To determine the combined length of time that Pulsar, Polly, and Petra stand on their back legs, we need to calculate the time each one spends standing on their back legs and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, we know that Pulsar stands on his two back legs for a total of 10 minutes.\n\nNext, Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar.

Let's denote this time as \\( P \\):\n\\[ P = 10 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar. Therefore, the time Polly spends standing on her back legs is:\n\\[ 3P = 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThen, Petra stands on his back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly. Therefore, the time Petra spends standing on his back legs is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{6} \\times 30 = 5 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we sum the times spent by Pulsar, Polly, and Petra:\n\\[ P + 3P + \\frac{1}{6} \\times 30 = 10 + 30 + 5 = 45 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThus, the combined length of time that the three entertainers stand on their back legs is:\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]",
