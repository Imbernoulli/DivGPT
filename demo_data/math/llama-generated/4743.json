Let's start by defining the number of times Zoe babysat Zachary.\n\nLet \\( z \\) be the number of times Zoe babysat Zachary. According to the problem, Zoe babysat Zachary 1/5 the number of times she babysat Chloe. Therefore, the number of times she babysat Chloe is \\( 5z \\).\n\nThe problem also states that Zoe babysat Julie three times as often as she babysat Zachary. Therefore, the number of times she babysat Julie is \\( 3z \\).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the earnings from babysitting each child. Zoe made $600 babysitting Zachary. Since she babysat Zachary \\( z \\) times, her hourly rate for babysitting Zachary is:\n\\[\n\\text{Hourly rate for babysitting Zachary} = \\frac{600}{z}\n\\]\n\nUsing this hourly rate, we can calculate her earnings from babysitting Chloe and Julie:\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from babysitting Chloe} = 5z \\times \\frac{600}{z} = 5 \\times 600 = 3000\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from babysitting Julie} = 3z \\times \\frac{600}{z} = 3 \\times 600 = 1800\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum up her earnings from babysitting all three children:\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings from babysitting} = 600 + 3000 + 1800 = 5400\n\\]\n\nZoe's total earnings from all activities is $8,000. Therefore, her earnings from pool cleaning is:\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from pool cleaning} = 8000 - 5400 = 2600\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount Zoe earned from pool cleaning is \\(\\boxed{2600}\\).",
        "To determine how much Zoe earned from pool cleaning, we need to break down her earnings from babysitting. Let's define the number of times Zoe babysat Zachary as \\( z \\). According to the problem, Zoe babysat Julie three times as often as she babysat Zachary, so she babysat Julie \\( 3z \\) times. Additionally, the number of times she babysat Zachary was \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) the number of times she babysat Chloe, so she babysat Chloe \\( 5z \\) times.\n\nWe know that Zoe made $600 babysitting Zachary. Since she babysat Zachary \\( z \\) times, her hourly rate for babysitting Zachary is:\n\\[\n\\text{Hourly rate for babysitting Zachary} = \\frac{600}{z}\n\\]\n\nThe total earnings from babysitting can be calculated as the sum of the earnings from babysitting Zachary, Julie, and Chloe:\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings from babysitting} = 600 + 600 \\cdot \\frac{3z}{z} + 600 \\cdot \\frac{5z}{z} = 600 + 1800 + 3000 = 5400\n\\]\n\nSince Zoe's total earnings from all activities is $8,000, her earnings from pool cleaning are:\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from pool cleaning} = 8000 - 5400 = 2600\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount Zoe earned from pool cleaning is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2600}\n\\]"
