        "To determine how many gallons Martha's car requires to make a 300-mile trip, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find Martha's car's fuel efficiency:**\n   Darlene's car gets 20 miles per gallon. Martha's car gets half as many miles per gallon as Darlene's car. Therefore, we calculate Martha's car's fuel efficiency as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Martha's car's fuel efficiency} = \\frac{20 \\text{ miles/gallon}}{2} = 10 \\text{ miles/gallon}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the amount of fuel needed for a 300-mile trip:**\n   Martha's car travels 10 miles per gallon. To find out how many gallons are needed for a 300-mile trip, we divide the total distance by the fuel efficiency:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gallons needed} = \\frac{300 \\text{ miles}}{10 \\text{ miles/gallon}} = 30 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Martha’s car requires \\(\\boxed{30}\\) gallons to make a 300-mile trip.",
