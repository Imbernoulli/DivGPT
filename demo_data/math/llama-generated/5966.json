This can be calculated by adding the points she lost back to her final points:\n\n\\[60 \\text{ points} + 20 \\text{ points} = 80 \\text{ points}\\]\n\nThis means Jane gained a total of 80 points from winning rounds. Since she earns 10 points for each round she wins, we can find the number of rounds she won by dividing the total points gained by the points per round:\n\n\\[80 \\text{ points} \\div 10 \\text{ points/round} = 8 \\text{ rounds}\\]\n\nThus, Jane played \\(\\boxed{8}\\) rounds.",

        "To determine how many rounds Jane played, we need to consider both the points she gained and the points she lost. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Jane ends up with 60 points after playing.\n2. She lost 20 points during the game.\n3. Therefore, the total points she had before losing 20 points is:\n   \\[\n   60 + 20 = 80\n   \\]\n4. Since Jane gains 10 points for each round she wins, the number of rounds she played is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{80}{10} = 8\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of rounds Jane played is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
        "To determine how many rounds Jane played, we need to consider both the points she gained and the points she lost. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Points Calculation**: Jane ends up with 60 points after playing. If she lost 20 points, then the total points she had before losing those 20 points was:\n   \\[\n   60 + 20 = 80\n   \\]\n   So, Jane had 80 points before she lost 20 points.\n\n2. **Points per Round**: Jane gains 10 points for each round she wins. Since she had 80 points before losing any points, the number of rounds she played is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{80}{10} = 8\n   \\]\n   So, Jane played 8 rounds.\n\nTherefore, the number of rounds Jane played is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
        "To determine how many rounds Jane played, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Jane's net points from winning rounds and losing points.\n2. Calculate how many rounds she won based on her net points.\n\nFirst, we know that Jane ends up with 60 points after losing 20 points. Therefore, her net points from winning rounds is:\n\\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \\]\nThis means that if we add up all the points she gained from winning rounds, it should total 80 points.\n\nSince Jane earns 10 points for each round she wins, the number of rounds she won is:\n\\[ \\frac{80}{10} = 8 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of rounds Jane played is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
        "To determine the number of rounds Jane played, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the points system:**\n   - Jane earns 10 points for each round she wins.\n   - Jane loses 20 points.\n\n2. **Set up the equation:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the number of rounds Jane won.\n   - Jane's total points after playing can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     10x - 20\n     \\]\n\n3. **Use the given information:**\n   - Jane ends up with 60 points. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     10x - 20 = 60\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Add 20 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     10x - 20 + 20 = 60 + 20\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     10x = 80\n     \\]\n\n   - Divide both sides by 10 to solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{80}{10}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 8\n

        "To determine how many rounds Jane played, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how many points Jane won.\n2. Calculate the number of rounds she played based on the points she won.\n\nFirst, we know Jane ended up with 60 points and she lost 20 points. Therefore, the total points she won can be calculated by adding the points she ended up with to the points she lost:\n\\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \\text{ points} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Jane earns 10 points for each round she wins. To find out how many rounds she played, we divide the total points she won by the points she earns per round:\n\\[ \\frac{80}{10} = 8 \\]\n\nSo, Jane played \\(\\boxed{8}\\) rounds.",
