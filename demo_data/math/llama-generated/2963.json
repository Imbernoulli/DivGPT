        "To determine the number of students in the Period 2 gym class, we start by defining a variable for the number of students in the Period 2 gym class. Let's denote the number of students in the Period 2 gym class as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of students in the Period 1 gym class is 5 fewer than twice the number of students in the Period 2 gym class. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n\\[ 2x - 5 = 11 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve this equation for \\( x \\). First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( x \\) on one side:\n\\[ 2x - 5 + 5 = 11 + 5 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 16 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ \\frac{2x}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students in the Period 2 gym class is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

Therefore, we can substitute 11 for the number of students in Period 1 in the equation:\n\\[ 11 = 2x - 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve this equation for \\( x \\). First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( x \\) on one side:\n\\[ 11 + 5 = 2x \\]\n\\[ 16 = 2x \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ \\frac{16}{2} = x \\]\n\\[ 8 = x \\]\n\nSo, the number of students in the Period 2 gym class is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
