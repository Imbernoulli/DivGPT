        "To determine the percentage of frogs that have mutated, we first need to find the total number of frogs in the pond. Francine caught 5 frogs with extra legs, 2 frogs with 2 heads, 2 frogs that are bright red, and 18 normal frogs. Adding these together gives:\n\n\\[5 + 2 + 2 + 18 = 27\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of mutated frogs. The mutated frogs include those with extra legs, those with 2 heads, and those that are bright red. Adding these together gives:\n\n\\[5 + 2 + 2 = 9\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the percentage of the frogs that are mutated. This is done by dividing the number of mutated frogs by the total number of frogs and then multiplying by 100:\n\n\\[\\left(\\frac{9}{27}\\right) \\times 100 = 33.33\\]\n\nRounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:\n\n\\[33\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the frogs that have mutated is \\(\\boxed{33}\\).",
