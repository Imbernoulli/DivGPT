The teacher brings in 14 mini-cupcakes and 12 donut holes. So, the total number of desserts is:\n\\[ 14 + 12 = 26 \\]\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of desserts by the number of students. There are 13 students in the class. So, we divide 26 by 13:\n\\[ 26 \\div 13 = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, each student gets \\(\\boxed{2}\\) desserts."
