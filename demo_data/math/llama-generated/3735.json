        "To determine the total number of yards run by Malik, Josiah, and Darnell, we need to calculate the yards each athlete ran over the 4 games and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total yards run by Malik:\n\\[\n\\text{Yards run by Malik} = 18 \\text{ yards/game} \\times 4 \\text{ games} = 72 \\text{ yards}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total yards run by Josiah:\n\\[\n\\text{Yards run by Josiah} = 22 \\text{ yards/game} \\times 4 \\text{ games} = 88 \\text{ yards}\n\\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the total yards run by Darnell. Since Darnell had an average of 11 yards per game over 4 games, we can find the total yards by multiplying the average by the number of games:\n\\[\n\\text{Yards run by Darnell} = 11 \\text{ yards/game} \\times 4 \\text{ games} = 44 \\text{ yards}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the yards run by all three athletes:\n\\[\n\\text{Total yards} = \\text{Yards run by Malik} + \\text{Yards run by Josiah} + \\text{Yards run by Darnell} = 72 + 88 + 44\n\\]\n\nAdding these amounts together:\n\\[\n72 + 88 = 160\n\\]\n\\[\n160 + 44 = 204\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of yards run by the three athletes is \\boxed{204}.",
