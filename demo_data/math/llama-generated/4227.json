        "To determine the total house rent, we start by defining the share of the rent that Purity pays as \\( P \\). According to the problem, Rose's share is three times Purity's share, so we can write:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rose's share} = 3P \\]\n\nWe are given that Rose's share is $1,800. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 3P = 1800 \\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{1800}{3} = 600 \\]\n\nSo, Purity's share of the rent is $600. Sheila has offered to pay five times Purity's share, so we can calculate Sheila's share as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sheila's share} = 5P = 5 \\times 600 = 3000 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total house rent by adding the shares of Sheila, Purity, and Rose:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total house rent} = \\text{Sheila's share} + \\text{Purity's share} + \\text{Rose's share} = 3000 + 600 + 1800 = 5400 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total house rent is \\(\\boxed{5400}\\).",
