        "To determine how many bananas Donna has, we start by identifying the number of bananas each person has based on the information given.\n\n1. We know that Lydia has 60 bananas.\n2. Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia. Therefore, we can calculate the number of bananas Dawn has as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bananas Dawn has} = \\text{Number of bananas Lydia has} + 40 = 60 + 40 = 100\n   \\]\n3. The total number of bananas that Dawn, Lydia, and Donna have is 200. We can represent this with the following equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bananas Dawn has} + \\text{Number of bananas Lydia has} + \\text{Number of bananas Donna has} = 200\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values into the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   100 + 60 + \\text{Number of bananas Donna has} = 200\n   \\]\n4. To find the number of bananas Donna has, we subtract the sum of the bananas Dawn and Lydia have from the total number of bananas:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bananas Donna has} = 200 - (100 + 60) = 200 - 160 = 40\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Donna has \\(\\boxed{40}\\) bananas.",

Dawn has 40 more bananas than Lydia.\n3. Lydia has 60 bananas.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many bananas Dawn has.
