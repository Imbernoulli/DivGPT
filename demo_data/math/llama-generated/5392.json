        "To determine how much money Beth and Jan have altogether, we start by finding out how much money Beth has. According to the problem, if Beth had $35 more, she would have $105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Beth's current amount of money:\n\n\\[ \\text{Beth's money} + 35 = 105 \\]\n\nSubtracting $35 from both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Beth's money} = 105 - 35 = 70 \\]\n\nSo, Beth has $70.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Jan has. The problem states that if Jan had $10 less, he would have the same amount of money as Beth has. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Jan's current amount of money:\n\n\\[ \\text{Jan's money} - 10 = 70 \\]\n\nAdding $10 to both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Jan's money} = 70 + 10 = 80 \\]\n\nSo, Jan has $80.\n\nTo find out how much money Beth and Jan have altogether, we add their amounts of money:\n\n\\[ \\text{Beth's money} + \\text{Jan's money} = 70 + 80 = 150 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money that Beth and Jan have altogether is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]",
