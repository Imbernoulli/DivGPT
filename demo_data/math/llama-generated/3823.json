        "To determine how much each charity gets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cookies John makes:**\n   John makes 6 dozen cookies. Since one dozen equals 12 cookies:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 12 = 72 \\text{ cookies}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the cookies:**\n   Each cookie is sold for $1.5. Therefore, the total revenue is:\n   \\[\n   72 \\times 1.5 = 108 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost to make the cookies:**\n   Each cookie costs $0.25 to make. Therefore, the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   72 \\times 0.25 = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the profit:**\n   Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:\n   \\[\n   108 - 18 = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine how much each charity gets:**\n   John splits the profit evenly between two charities. Therefore, each charity gets:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{90}{2} = 45 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, each charity gets \\(\\boxed{45}\\) dollars.",

Since one dozen is equal to 12 cookies, we have:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 12 = 72 \\text{ cookies}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total revenue from selling the cookies:**\n   John sells each cookie for $1.5. Therefore, the total revenue is:\n   \\[\n   72 \\times 1.5 = 108 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of making the cookies:**\n   Each cookie costs $0.25 to make. Therefore, the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   72 \\times 0.25 = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:**\n   The profit is:\n   \\[\n   108 - 18 = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Divide the profit by 2 to find out how much each charity gets:**\n   Since John splits the profit between two charities evenly, each charity gets:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{90}{2} = 45 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each charity gets \\(\\boxed{45}\\) dollars.",
