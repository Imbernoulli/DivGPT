        "To determine the total cost of a sundae with 10 toppings, we need to consider both the cost of the ice cream and the cost of the toppings.\n\nFirst, let's identify the cost of the ice cream:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of ice cream} = \\$2.00 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost of the toppings. Since each topping costs \\$0.50 and there are 10 toppings, we multiply the cost per topping by the number of toppings:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of toppings} = 10 \\times \\$0.50 = \\$5.00 \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the ice cream and the cost of the toppings to find the total cost of the sundae:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\$2.00 + \\$5.00 = \\$7.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of a sundae with 10 toppings is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
