The gym close to his house is close but doesn't have everything he wants so he gets two different gym memberships.  The cheap one costs $10 a month and has a sign-up fee of $50.  The second gym is 3 times more expensive and it has a sign-up fee of 4 months membership.  How much total did he pay in the first year for gym membership?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
