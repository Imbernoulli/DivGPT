        "To determine how many days it will take for Jamie's father to burn off 5 pounds, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**\n   Jamie's father burns 2,500 calories a day through light exercise and consumes 2,000 calories a day through his diet. The daily calorie deficit is:\n   \\[\n   2,500 \\text{ calories burned} - 2,000 \\text{ calories consumed} = 500 \\text{ calories deficit per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total calories needed to lose 5 pounds:**\n   There are 3,500 calories in a pound of body fat. Therefore, to lose 5 pounds, the total calories needed are:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ pounds} \\times 3,500 \\text{ calories per pound} = 17,500 \\text{ calories}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of days required to burn 17,500 calories:**\n   Since Jamie's father has a daily calorie deficit of 500 calories, the number of days required to burn 17,500 calories is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{17,500 \\text{ calories}}{500 \\text{ calories per day}} = 35 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\nThus, it will take Jamie's father \\boxed{35} days to burn off 5 pounds.",
