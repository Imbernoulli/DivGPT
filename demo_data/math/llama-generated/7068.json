        "To determine the value of the rest of the money Randy had after giving some to Sally, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Randy had after Smith gave him $200.\n2. Subtract the amount Randy gave to Sally from the total amount he had after receiving the money from Smith.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Randy initially had $3,000 and Smith gave him an additional $200. So, the total amount of money Randy had after receiving the money from Smith is:\n\\[ 3000 + 200 = 3200 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount Randy gave to Sally from the total amount he had after receiving the money from Smith. Randy gave Sally $1,200. So, the amount of money Randy had left after giving $1,200 to Sally is:\n\\[ 3200 - 1200 = 2000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of the rest of the money Randy had is \\(\\boxed{2000}\\).",
