Therefore, the daily earnings are:\n\\[ 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince there are 365 days in a year, the annual earnings are:\n\\[ 8,000,000 \\times 365 = 2,920,000,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate MegaCorp's total annual expenses.**\n\nMegaCorp's monthly expenses are $30,000,000. Therefore, the annual expenses are:\n\\[ 30,000,000 \\times 12 = 360,000,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine MegaCorp's annual profit.**\n\nThe annual profit is the annual earnings minus the annual expenses:\n\\[ 2,920,000,000 - 360,000,000 = 2,560,000,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the fine.**\n\nThe fine is 1% of the annual profit:\n\\[ 0.01 \\times 2,560,000,000 = 25,600,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, MegaCorp's fine is:\n\\[ \\boxed{25600000} \\]"
