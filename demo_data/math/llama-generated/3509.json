        "To determine how much more money Tina made compared to Marvin, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of candy bars Tina sold.\n2. Determine the total amount of money Marvin made.\n3. Determine the total amount of money Tina made.\n4. Find the difference between the amounts of money Tina and Marvin made.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of candy bars Tina sold. Since Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin, we multiply the number of candy bars Marvin sold by 3:\n\\[ 35 \\times 3 = 105 \\]\nSo, Tina sold 105 candy bars.\n\nNext, we determine the total amount of money Marvin made. Since each candy bar costs $2 and Marvin sold 35 candy bars, we multiply the number of candy bars Marvin sold by the price per candy bar:\n\\[ 35 \\times 2 = 70 \\]\nSo, Marvin made $70.\n\nThen, we determine the total amount of money Tina made. Since each candy bar costs $2 and Tina sold 105 candy bars, we multiply the number of candy bars Tina sold by the price per candy bar:\n\\[ 105 \\times 2 = 210 \\]\nSo, Tina made $210.\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the amounts of money Tina and Marvin made:\n\\[ 210 - 70 = 140 \\]\nSo, Tina made $140 more than Marvin.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]",

Find the difference between the amount of money Tina made and the amount of money Marvin made.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of candy bars Tina sold. Since Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin, we multiply the number of candy bars Marvin sold by 3:\n\\[ 35 \\times 3 = 105 \\]\nSo, Tina sold 105 candy bars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of money Marvin made. Since each candy bar costs $2 and Marvin sold 35 candy bars, we multiply the number of candy bars Marvin sold by 2:\n\\[ 35 \\times 2 = 70 \\]\nSo, Marvin made $70.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money Tina made. Since each candy bar costs $2 and Tina sold 105 candy bars, we multiply the number of candy bars Tina sold by 2:\n\\[ 105 \\times 2 = 210 \\]\nSo, Tina made $210.\n\nFinally, let's find the difference between the amount of money Tina made and the amount of money Marvin made:\n\\[ 210 - 70 = 140 \\]\nSo, Tina made $140 more than Marvin.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{140}\\).",
