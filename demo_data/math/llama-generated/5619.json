        "To determine how much money Randy will have in his piggy bank after a year, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spends each month and then extend that to a year.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of money Randy spends each month:\n- Randy makes 4 trips to the store every month.\n- He spends $2 on each trip.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Monthly spending} = 4 \\text{ trips/month} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/trip} = 8 \\text{ dollars/month}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of money Randy spends in a year:\n- There are 12 months in a year.\n- He spends $8 each month.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Annual spending} = 12 \\text{ months/year} \\times 8 \\text{ dollars/month} = 96 \\text{ dollars/year}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the annual spending from the initial amount of money in the piggy bank:\n- Randy starts with $200.\n- He spends $96 over the year.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining money} = 200 \\text{ dollars} - 96 \\text{ dollars} = 104 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money in Randy's piggy bank after a year will be \\(\\boxed{104}\\).",
        "To determine how much money Randy will have in his piggy bank after a year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of trips Randy makes to the store in a year.\n2. Determine the total amount of money Randy spends in a year.\n3. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money in the piggy bank.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of trips Randy makes to the store in a year. Since he makes 4 trips to the store every month and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of trips per month by the number of months in a year:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ trips/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 48 \\text{ trips/year}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the total amount of money Randy spends in a year. Since he spends $2 on each trip to the store and he makes 48 trips in a year, we multiply the number of trips by the amount spent per trip:\n\\[\n48 \\text{ trips/year} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/trip} = 96 \\text{ dollars/year}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money in the piggy bank. Randy starts with $200 and spends $96 in a year, so we subtract $96 from $200:\n\\[\n200 \\text{ dollars} - 96 \\text{ dollars} = 104 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money in Randy's piggy bank after a year is \\boxed{104}.",

Determine the total amount of money Randy spends in a year.\n3. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money in the piggy bank.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many trips Randy makes to the store in a year. Since he makes 4 trips every month and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of trips per month by the number of months in a year:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ trips/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 48 \\text{ trips/year}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total amount of money Randy spends in a year. Since he spends $2 on each trip, we multiply the number of trips per year by the amount spent per trip:\n\\[\n48 \\text{ trips/year} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/trip} = 96 \\text{ dollars/year}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount spent in a year from the initial amount of money in the piggy bank:\n\\[\n200 \\text{ dollars} - 96 \\text{ dollars} = 104 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money in Randy's piggy bank after a year is \\(\\boxed{104}\\).",
        "To determine how much money Randy will have in his piggy bank after a year, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spends over the course of 12 months.\n\nFirst, we calculate how much money Randy spends each month.

Since he spends $2 on each trip, we multiply the number of trips per year by the amount spent per trip:\n\\[ 48 \\text{ trips/year} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/trip} = 96 \\text{ dollars/year} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount spent in a year from the initial amount of money in the piggy bank:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ dollars} - 96 \\text{ dollars} = 104 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money in Randy's piggy bank after a year is \\(\\boxed{104}\\).",
