        "To determine the number of male contestants at the singing competition, we start by identifying the fraction of contestants who are male. Since a third of the contestants are female, the remaining contestants must be male. This means that two-thirds of the contestants are male.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of male contestants by multiplying the total number of contestants by the fraction that represents the male contestants. The total number of contestants is 18, and the fraction of contestants who are male is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of male contestants} = 18 \\times \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication, we multiply 18 by 2 and then divide the result by 3:\n\\[\n18 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{18 \\times 2}{3} = \\frac{36}{3} = 12\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of male contestants is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
        "To determine the number of male contestants in the singing competition, we start by calculating the number of female contestants. According to the problem, one third of the contestants are female. Given that there are 18 contestants in total, we can find the number of female contestants by multiplying 18 by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of female contestants} = 18 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of male contestants. Since the total number of contestants is 18 and we have already determined that 6 of them are female, we subtract the number of female contestants from the total number of contestants:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of male contestants} = 18 - 6 = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of male contestants is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",

        "To determine the number of male contestants in the singing competition, we start by finding out how many contestants are female. According to the problem, one-third of the contestants are female. Therefore, we can calculate the number of female contestants by multiplying the total number of contestants by one-third:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of female contestants} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 18 = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many contestants are male.

        "To determine how many contestants are male, we start by identifying the fraction of contestants that are male. Since a third of the contestants are female, the remaining two-thirds must be male. This can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the number of female contestants:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of female contestants} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 18 = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract the number of female contestants from the total number of contestants to find the number of male contestants:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of male contestants} = 18 - 6 = 12\n   \\]\n\nAlternatively, we can directly calculate the number of male contestants by finding two-thirds of the total number of contestants:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of male contestants} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 18 = 12\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of male contestants is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
