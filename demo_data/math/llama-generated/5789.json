        "To determine how much money Ken will get back after his purchase, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the steak.\n2. Subtract the total cost from the amount Ken paid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the steak. Ken is buying two pounds of steak, and each pound costs $7. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ pounds} \\times 7 \\text{ dollars per pound} = 14 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost from the amount Ken paid. Ken paid with a $20 bill, so we subtract $14 from $20:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ dollars} - 14 \\text{ dollars} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Ken will get back is \\boxed{6}.",
