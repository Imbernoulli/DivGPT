        "To determine the number of red jellybeans in the jar, we start by calculating the total number of jellybeans that are not red. The jar contains three colors of jellybeans: blue, purple, and orange.\n\nFirst, we add the number of blue jellybeans, purple jellybeans, and orange jellybeans together:\n\\[ 14 + 26 + 40 = 80 \\]\n\nThis sum tells us that there are 80 jellybeans that are either blue, purple, or orange. Since the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 200, we can find the number of red jellybeans by subtracting the number of blue, purple, and orange jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:\n\\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of red jellybeans is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",

Subtract the total number of non-red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans in the jar to find the number of red jellybeans.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of non-red jellybeans:\n- There are 14 blue jellybeans.\n- There are 26 purple jellybeans.\n- There are 40 orange jellybeans.\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[ 14 + 26 + 40 = 80 \\]\n\nSo, there are 80 non-red jellybeans. Since the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 200, we subtract the number of non-red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of red jellybeans:\n\\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of red jellybeans is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
