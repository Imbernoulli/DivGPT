        "To determine the total number of ads Vermont clicked on, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of ads on each web page.\n2. Find the total number of ads on all four web pages.\n3. Determine the number of ads Vermont clicked on by calculating 2/3 of the total number of ads.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of ads on each web page:\n- The first web page has 12 ads.\n- The second web page has twice as many ads as the first web page, so it has \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) ads.\n- The third web page has 24 more ads than the second web page, so it has \\(24 + 24 = 48\\) ads.\n- The fourth web page has 3/4 times as many ads as the second web page, so it has \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times 24 = 18\\) ads.\n\nNext, let's find the total number of ads on all four web pages:\n\\[12 + 24 + 48 + 18 = 102\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of ads Vermont clicked on by calculating 2/3 of the total number of ads:\n\\[\\frac{2}{3} \\times 102 = 68\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of ads Vermont clicked on is \\(\\boxed{68}\\)."
