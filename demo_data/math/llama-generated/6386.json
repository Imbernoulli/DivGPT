The number of followers on TikTok is 3 times the number of followers he has on Twitter. Since he has 370 followers on Twitter, the number of followers on TikTok is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 370 = 1110 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the number of followers Malcolm has on YouTube. The number of followers on YouTube is 510 more than the number of followers he has on TikTok. Since he has 1110 followers on TikTok, the number of followers on YouTube is:\n\\[ 1110 + 510 = 1620 \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the number of followers on all the social media platforms. The number of followers on Instagram is 240, the number of followers on Facebook is 500, the number of followers on Twitter is 370, the number of followers on TikTok is 1110, and the number of followers on YouTube is 1620. Therefore, the total number of followers is:\n\\[ 240 + 500 + 370 + 1110 + 1620 = 3840 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of followers Malcolm has on all his social media is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3840} \\]",
