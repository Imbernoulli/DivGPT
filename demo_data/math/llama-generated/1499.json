        "To find the area of the smaller rectangle, we first need to determine its dimensions. Since the smaller rectangle is similar to the larger rectangle and has half the length and width, we can calculate the dimensions of the smaller rectangle as follows:\n\nThe length of the larger rectangle is 40 meters. Therefore, the length of the smaller rectangle is:\n\\[ \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThe width of the larger rectangle is 20 meters. Therefore, the width of the smaller rectangle is:\n\\[ \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the smaller rectangle using the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\]\n\nSubstituting the dimensions of the smaller rectangle into the formula, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = 20 \\times 10 = 200 \\text{ square meters} \\]\n\nThus, the area of the smaller rectangle is:\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]",
