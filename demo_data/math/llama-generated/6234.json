        "To determine the difference between the number of cupcakes Betty and Dora made after 5 hours, we need to account for the fact that Betty took a two-hour break. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of cupcakes Dora made in 5 hours. Since Dora makes 8 cupcakes every hour, we can find the total number of cupcakes she made by multiplying her hourly rate by the total number of hours:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ cupcakes/hour} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 40 \\text{ cupcakes}\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the number of cupcakes Betty made in 5 hours, taking into account her two-hour break. Since Betty makes 10 cupcakes every hour, she only worked for \\(5 - 2 = 3\\) hours. Therefore, the total number of cupcakes she made is:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ cupcakes/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ cupcakes}\n\\]\n\nNow, find the difference between the number of cupcakes Dora made and the number of cupcakes Betty made:\n\\[\n40 \\text{ cupcakes} - 30 \\text{ cupcakes} = 10 \\text{ cupcakes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the difference between the number of cupcakes they made after 5 hours is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
