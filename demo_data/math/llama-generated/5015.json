        "To determine the total amount of money Olivia pays, we need to calculate the value of the quarters she uses for chips and soda and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the quarters for the chips:\n- Olivia pays 4 quarters for chips.\n- Each quarter is worth $0.25.\n- Therefore, the total value for the chips is \\(4 \\times 0.25 = 1\\) dollar.\n\nNext, let's calculate the value of the quarters for the soda:\n- Olivia pays 12 quarters for soda.\n- Each quarter is worth $0.25.\n- Therefore, the total value for the soda is \\(12 \\times 0.25 = 3\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we add the amounts for the chips and the soda to find the total amount Olivia pays:\n- The total value for the chips is $1.\n- The total value for the soda is $3.\n- Therefore, the total amount Olivia pays is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\) dollars.\n\nSo, the total amount Olivia pays is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
