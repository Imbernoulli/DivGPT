So, we rewrite the equation as:\n\\[ \\frac{3x}{6} - \\frac{2x}{6} - 30 = 0. \\]\n\nCombining the fractions, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{6} - 30 = 0. \\]\n\nAdding 30 to both sides of the equation, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{6} = 30. \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 6, we get:\n\\[ x = 180. \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Mark had when he entered the first store is \\(\\boxed{180}\\).",
        "Let's denote the amount of money Mark had when he entered the first store as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we analyze his spending in the first store:\n1. He spent one-half of his money, so he spent \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\).\n2. Then he spent an additional $14.\nTherefore, after spending in the first store, the amount of money he had left is:\n\\[ x - \\frac{x}{2} - 14 = \\frac{x}{2} - 14. \\]\n\nNext, we analyze his spending in the second store:\n1. He spent one-third of his starting money, so he spent \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\).\n2. Then he spent an additional $16.\nTherefore, after spending in the second store, the amount of money he had left is:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{x}{2} - 14 \\right) - \\frac{x}{3} - 16. \\]\n\nWe know that after spending in the second store, Mark had no money left. So we set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2} - 14 - \\frac{x}{3} - 16 = 0. \\]\n\nTo solve this equation, we first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 6. Rewriting the equation with a common denominator, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{3x}{6} - \\frac{2x}{6} - 14 - 16 = 0, \\]\n\\[ \\frac{x}{6} - 30 = 0. \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by adding 30 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{6} = 30. \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides by 6:\n\\[ x = 180. \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Mark had when he entered the first store is \\(\\boxed{180}\\)."
