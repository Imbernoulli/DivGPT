        "To determine how much Zane paid for the polo shirts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discount on each polo shirt.\n2. Determine the price of each polo shirt after the discount.\n3. Calculate the total cost for the two polo shirts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the discount on each polo shirt. The original price of each polo shirt is $50, and the discount is 40%. Therefore, the discount amount for each polo shirt is:\n\\[ 50 \\times \\frac{40}{100} = 50 \\times 0.40 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the price of each polo shirt after the discount:\n\\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \\]\n\nSince Zane purchased 2 polo shirts, we multiply the discounted price of each polo shirt by 2:\n\\[ 30 \\times 2 = 60 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Zane paid for the shirts is:\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",
