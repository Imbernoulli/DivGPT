Each pair normally cost $10, but there's a discount of 10% on the total cost for people who purchase 3 or more pairs at once.

        "To determine how much Stacy can save by buying 3 pairs of shorts at once as opposed to purchasing them individually at different times, we need to calculate the total cost in both scenarios and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost if Stacy buys the shorts individually. Since each pair of shorts costs $10, and she is buying 3 pairs, the total cost is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost if Stacy buys the shorts at once and receives the 10% discount. The original cost for 3 pairs is $30, and with a 10% discount, the total cost is:\n\\[ 30 - (0.10 \\times 30) = 30 - 3 = 27 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe amount Stacy saves by buying the shorts at once is the difference between the two total costs:\n\\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Stacy can save \\(\\boxed{3}\\) dollars by buying 3 pairs at once as opposed to purchasing them individually at different times.",

First, we find 10% of $30:\n\\[ 0.10 \\times 30 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the discount from the original total cost:\n\\[ 30 - 3 = 27 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between the two amounts to determine the savings.**\n\nThe savings is the difference between the original total cost and the discounted total cost:\n\\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Stacy can save \\(\\boxed{3}\\) dollars by buying 3 pairs at once as opposed to purchasing them individually at different times.",

        "To determine how much Stacy can save by buying 3 pairs of shorts at once as opposed to purchasing them individually at different times, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of 3 pairs of shorts without the discount.\n2. Calculate the total cost of 3 pairs of shorts with the discount.\n3. Find the difference between the two total costs to determine the savings.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 3 pairs of shorts without the discount.**\n\nThe cost of one pair of shorts is $10. Therefore, the cost of 3 pairs without the discount is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of 3 pairs of shorts with the discount.**\n\nThere is a 10% discount on the total cost for people who purchase 3 or more pairs at once. First, we find 10% of $30:\n\\[ 0.10 \\times 30 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSubtract the discount from the original total cost:\n\\[ 30 - 3 = 27 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between the two total costs to determine the savings.**\n\nThe savings is the difference between the cost without the discount and the cost with the discount:\n\\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Stacy can save \\(\\boxed{3}\\) dollars by buying 3 pairs of shorts at once as opposed to purchasing them individually at different times.",
        "To determine how much Stacy can save by buying 3 pairs of shorts at once as opposed to purchasing them individually at different times, we need to calculate the total cost in both scenarios and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost if Stacy buys the shorts individually. Since each pair of shorts costs $10, the cost for 3 pairs is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost if Stacy buys the shorts at once with the discount. The discount is 10% off the total cost for people who purchase 3 or more pairs. The original cost for 3 pairs is $30, so the discount amount is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 0.10 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nTherefore, the total cost after the discount is:\n\\[ 30 - 3 = 27 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe amount Stacy can save by buying 3 pairs at once as opposed to purchasing them individually is the difference between the two total costs:\n\\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the amount Stacy can save is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]",
