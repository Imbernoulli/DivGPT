        "First, we calculate the weekly earnings for each employee. Since each employee earns $10 per hour and works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, their weekly earnings are:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 10 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 500 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the savings for each employee over four weeks. Robby saves \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of his salary, so his savings over four weeks are:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 500 \\times 4 \\times 0.4 = 800 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nJaylene saves \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of her salary, so her savings over four weeks are:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} \\times \\frac{3}{5} = 500 \\times 4 \\times 0.6 = 1200 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nMiranda saves \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of her salary, so her savings over four weeks are:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 500 \\times 4 \\times 0.5 = 1000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we add up the savings of all three employees to find the combined savings after four weeks:\n\\[ 800 \\text{ dollars} + 1200 \\text{ dollars} + 1000 \\text{ dollars} = 3000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the combined savings of the three employees after four weeks is \\(\\boxed{3000}\\).",
