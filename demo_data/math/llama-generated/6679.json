        "To determine the total number of cartons accepted by the customers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cartons each customer received. Since Kayden's business delivered an equal number of the 400 cartons to four customers, we divide 400 by 4:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400}{4} = 100\n   \\]\n   So, each customer received 100 cartons.\n\n2. Determine the number of cartons each customer returned. Each customer returned 60 cartons, so we subtract 60 from the 100 cartons each customer received:\n   \\[\n   100 - 60 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, each customer accepted 40 cartons.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of cartons accepted by all four customers. Since each customer accepted 40 cartons, we multiply 40 by 4:\n   \\[\n   40 \\times 4 = 160\n   \\]\n   So, the total number of cartons that were accepted by the customers is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of cartons accepted by the customers, we can break down the problem into several steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of cartons delivered to each customer:**\n   Kayden's business delivered an equal number of the 400 cartons to four customers. Therefore, the number of cartons delivered to each customer is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400}{4} = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of cartons returned by each customer:**\n   Each customer returned 60 cartons damaged during delivery. So, the number of cartons returned by each customer is 60.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of cartons accepted by each customer:**\n   The number of cartons accepted by each customer is the number of cartons delivered minus the number of cartons returned. Therefore, the number of cartons accepted by each customer is:\n   \\[\n   100 - 60 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of cartons accepted by all customers:**\n   Since there are four customers and each accepted 40 cartons, the total number of cartons accepted by all customers is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 40 = 160\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cartons that were accepted by the customers is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",

Calculate the total number of cartons accepted by all customers.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of cartons delivered to each customer.**\n\nKayden's business delivered an equal number of the 400 cartons to four customers. Therefore, the number of cartons delivered to each customer is:\n\\[\n\\frac{400}{4} = 100\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of cartons accepted by each customer after returns.**\n\nEach customer returned 60 cartons damaged during delivery. So, the number of cartons accepted by each customer is:\n\\[\n100 - 60 = 40\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of cartons accepted by all customers.**\n\nSince there are four customers and each accepted 40 cartons, the total number of cartons accepted by all customers is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 40 = 160\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of cartons that were accepted by the customers is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",

Determine the number of cartons each customer accepted after returning the damaged cartons.\n3. Calculate the total number of cartons accepted by all four customers.\n\nFirst, we find out how many cartons each customer received. Since Kayden's business delivered an equal number of the 400 cartons to four customers, we divide 400 by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{400}{4} = 100\n\\]\n\nSo, each customer received 100 cartons.

Each customer returned 60 cartons damaged during delivery. Therefore, the number of cartons accepted by each customer is the number of cartons received minus the number of cartons returned:\n\\[\n100 - 60 = 40\n\\]\nSo, each customer accepted 40 cartons.\n\nFinally, we sum the accepted cartons from all four customers:\n\\[\n40 + 40 + 40 + 40 = 160\n\\]\nThus, the total number of cartons that were accepted by the customers is \\boxed{160}.",
