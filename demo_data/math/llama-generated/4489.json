        "First, we determine how much money Mrs. Thomson spent on food. Since she spent \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the $240 on food, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 240 = 80\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how much money she spent on clothes. Since she spent \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the $240 on clothes, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times 240 = 48\n\\]\n\nNow, we find out how much money she has left after spending on food and clothes. We subtract the amounts spent on food and clothes from the total incentive:\n\n\\[\n240 - 80 - 48 = 112\n\\]\n\nThen, she put \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of the remaining $112 into her savings account.
