        "To determine the number of people living in Sun City, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many people live in Roseville City. We know that Roseville City has 500 less than thrice as many people as Willowdale City. Willowdale City has 2000 people. Therefore, we can calculate the population of Roseville City as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Population of Roseville City} = 3 \\times \\text{Population of Willowdale City} - 500\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Population of Roseville City} = 3 \\times 2000 - 500\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Population of Roseville City} = 6000 - 500\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Population of Roseville City} = 5500\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many people live in Sun City. We know that Sun City has 1000 more than twice as many people as Roseville City. Therefore, we can calculate the population of Sun City as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Population of Sun City} = 2 \\times \\text{Population of Roseville City} + 1000\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Population of Sun City} = 2 \\times 5500 + 1000\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Population of Sun City} = 11000 + 1000\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Population of Sun City} = 12000\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people living in Sun City is \\(\\boxed{12000}\\).",
        "To determine the population of Sun City, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we know the population of Willowdale City:\n\\[ W = 2000 \\]\n\nNext, we use the information about Roseville City. Roseville City has 500 less than thrice as many people as Willowdale City. Therefore, we can express the population of Roseville City as:\n\\[ R = 3W - 500 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( W \\) into the equation:\n\\[ R = 3(2000) - 500 = 6000 - 500 = 5500 \\]\n\nNow, we use the information about Sun City. Sun City has 1000 more than twice as many people as Roseville City. Therefore, we can express the population of Sun City as:\n\\[ S = 2R + 1000 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( R \\) into the equation:\n\\[ S = 2(5500) + 1000 = 11000 + 1000 = 12000 \\]\n\nThus, the population of Sun City is:\n\\[ \\boxed{12000} \\]",
