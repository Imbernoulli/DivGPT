        "To determine how many softballs the school can buy with the new budget, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the original budget.\n2. Determine the new budget after the 20% increase.\n3. Calculate how many softballs can be bought with the new budget.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the original budget.**\n\nThe school can buy 15 dodgeballs for $5 each if they spend the entire budget on dodgeballs. Therefore, the original budget is:\n\\[ 15 \\times 5 = 75 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the new budget after the 20% increase.**\n\nThe new budget is the original budget plus 20% of the original budget. So, we calculate 20% of $75 and add it to the original budget:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 75 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\\[ 75 + 15 = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many softballs can be bought with the new budget.**\n\nEach softball costs $9.
