        "To determine the number of pets at the shelter after one month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of dogs adopted in one month.\n2.

Every month, 50% of the dogs are adopted.\n\\[ 30 \\times 0.50 = 15 \\]\nSo, 15 dogs are adopted.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of cats adopted.**\nThe shelter starts with 28 cats. Every month, 25% of the cats are adopted.\n\\[ 28 \\times 0.25 = 7 \\]\nSo, 7 cats are adopted.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of lizards adopted.**\nThe shelter starts with 20 lizards. Every month, 20% of the lizards are adopted.\n\\[ 20 \\times 0.20 = 4 \\]\nSo, 4 lizards are adopted.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of pets remaining after adoptions.**\nSubtract the number of adopted pets from the initial number of each type of pet.\n\\[ \\text{Dogs remaining} = 30 - 15 = 15 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Cats remaining} = 28 - 7 = 21 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Lizards remaining} = 20 - 4 = 16 \\]\n\nNow, sum the remaining pets.\n\\[ 15 + 21 + 16 = 52 \\]\n\n**Step 5: Add the number of new pets taken in.**\nThe shelter takes in 13 new pets each month.\n\\[ 52 + 13 = 65 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pets at the shelter after one month is \\(\\boxed{65}\\)."
