        "To determine how much money June spent on music books, we need to calculate the total cost of the maths, science, and art books she bought and then subtract that from the $500 she initially had.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the maths books:\nJune buys four maths books at $20 each.\n\\[ 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\]\nSo, the cost of the maths books is $80.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the science books:\nJune buys six more science books than maths books. Since she bought four maths books, she buys:\n\\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \\]\nscience books. Each science book costs $10.\n\\[ 10 \\times 10 = 100 \\]\nSo, the cost of the science books is $100.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the art books:\nJune buys twice as many art books as maths books. Since she bought four maths books, she buys:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\nart books. Each art book costs $20.\n\\[ 8 \\times 20 = 160 \\]\nSo, the cost of the art books is $160.\n\nNext, we add up the costs of the maths, science, and art books to find out how much money she has spent so far:\n\\[ 80 + 100 + 160 = 340 \\]\nSo, June has spent $340 on maths, science, and art books.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount spent on maths, science, and art books from the initial amount of money she had to find out how much money she spent on music books:\n\\[ 500 - 340 = 160 \\]\nSo, the amount of money June spent on music books is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",

Since she bought 4 maths books, she buys:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\nart books. Each art book costs $20.\n\\[ 8 \\times 20 = 160 \\]\nSo, the cost of the art books is $160.\n\nNext, we add up the costs of the maths, science, and art books:\n\\[ 80 + 100 + 160 = 340 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the maths, science, and art books is $340.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total cost of the maths, science, and art books from June's initial amount of $500 to find out how much she spent on music books:\n\\[ 500 - 340 = 160 \\]\nSo, the amount of money June spent on music books is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
        "To determine how much money June spent on music books, we need to calculate the total cost of the maths books, science books, and art books she bought, and then subtract that from the total amount of money she had.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the maths books:\n- June buys 4 maths books.\n- Each maths book costs $20.\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of maths books} = 4 \\times 20 = 80\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the science books:\n- June buys 6 more science books than maths books.\n- She bought 4 maths books, so she buys \\(4 + 6 = 10\\) science books.\n- Each science book costs $10.\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of science books} = 10 \\times 10 = 100\n\\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the cost of the art books:\n- June buys twice as many art books as maths books.\n- She bought 4 maths books, so she buys \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) art books.\n- Each art book costs $20.\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of art books} = 8 \\times 20 = 160\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the total cost of the maths books, science books, and art books:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 80 + 100 + 160 = 340\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's determine how much money June spent on music books by subtracting the total cost of the maths books, science books, and art books from the total amount of money she had:\n\\[\n\\text{Money spent on music books} = 500 - 340 = 160\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount of money June spent on music books is \\(\\boxed{160}\\)."
