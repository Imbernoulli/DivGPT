He gave 5 of his students a short period of time to remove as many balls each from a basket as they could. 3 of them removed 8 balls each and the other 2 removed a certain number of balls each. If a total of 56 balls are still in the baskets, how many balls did the other 2 students each remove?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
