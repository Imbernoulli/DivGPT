Add the tax to the discounted total to get the final amount paid.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of shirts Tom bought:**\n   Tom buys 5 shirts from each of his 4 favorite fandoms.\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ shirts/fandom} \\times 4 \\text{ fandoms} = 20 \\text{ shirts}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total cost of the shirts before the discount:**\n   Each shirt costs $15.\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ shirts} \\times 15 \\text{ dollars/shirt} = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the 20% discount:**\n   The discount is 20%, so we need to find 20% of $300 and subtract it from the original total.\n   \\[\n   20\\% \\text{ of } 300 \\text{ dollars} = 0.20 \\times 300 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discounted total} = 300 \\text{ dollars} - 60 \\text{ dollars} = 240 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the tax on the discounted total:**\n   The tax rate is 10%, so we need to find 10% of $240.\n   \\[\n   10\\% \\text{ of } 240 \\text{ dollars} = 0.10 \\times 240 = 24 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Add the tax to the discounted total to get the final amount paid:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final amount paid} = 240 \\text{ dollars} + 24 \\text{ dollars} = 264 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Tom paid is \\(\\boxed{264}\\).",

Add the tax to the discounted total to find the final amount paid.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of shirts Tom bought.\n   Tom buys 5 shirts from each of his 4 favorite fandoms.\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ shirts/fandom} \\times 4 \\text{ fandoms} = 20 \\text{ shirts}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the total cost of the shirts before the discount.\n   Each shirt costs $15.\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ shirts} \\times 15 \\text{ dollars/shirt} = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. Apply the 20% discount to find the discounted total.\n   The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is:\n   \\[\n   300 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.20 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   The discounted total cost is:\n   \\[\n   300 \\text{ dollars} - 60 \\text{ dollars} = 240 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the 10% tax on the discounted total.\n   The tax is 10%, so the tax amount is:\n   \\[\n   240 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.10 = 24 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. Add the tax to the discounted total to find the final amount paid.\n   The final amount paid is:\n   \\[\n   240 \\text{ dollars} + 24 \\text{ dollars} = 264 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Tom paid is \\(\\boxed{264}\\)."
