        "To determine how much money Cheyenne made from selling the remaining clay pots, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pots that cracked.\n2. Determine the number of pots that did not crack.\n3. Calculate the total revenue from the pots that did not crack.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of pots that cracked. Cheyenne made 80 clay pots and 2/5 of them cracked. Therefore, we multiply 80 by 2/5:\n\n\\[\n80 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 80 \\times 0.4 = 32\n\\]\n\nSo, 32 pots cracked. Next, we determine the number of pots that did not crack by subtracting the number of cracked pots from the total number of pots:\n\n\\[\n80 - 32 = 48\n\\]\n\nCheyenne sold the remaining 48 pots at $40 per pot. To find out how much money she made, we multiply the number of pots sold by the price per pot:\n\n\\[\n48 \\times 40 = 1920\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Cheyenne made from selling the remaining items is \\boxed{1920}.",

So, we calculate the number of cracked pots as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cracked pots} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 80 = \\frac{2 \\times 80}{5} = \\frac{160}{5} = 32\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of pots that did not crack.**\n\nSince 32 pots cracked, the number of pots that did not crack is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of uncracked pots} = 80 - 32 = 48\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the pots that did not crack.**\n\nCheyenne sold each uncracked pot for $40. Therefore, the total revenue is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total revenue} = 48 \\times 40 = 1920\n\\]\n\nSo, the amount of money Cheyenne made from selling the remaining items is \\(\\boxed{1920}\\).",

Since Cheyenne made 80 pots and 32 of them cracked, the number of pots that did not crack is:\n\\[\n80 - 32 = 48\n\\]\nSo, 48 pots did not crack.\n\nNow, we calculate the total revenue from the pots that did not crack. Each pot is sold for $40, so the total revenue is:\n\\[\n48 \\times 40 = 1920\n\\]\nTherefore, the amount of money Cheyenne made from selling the remaining pots is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1920}\n\\]",
