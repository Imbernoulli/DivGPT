        "To determine the total amount of water Micah drank from the morning until the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of water Micah drank in the afternoon.\n2. Add the amount of water she drank in the morning to the amount she drank in the afternoon.\n\nFirst, we know that Micah drank 1.5 liters of water in the morning. In the afternoon, she drank three times that amount. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of water she drank in the afternoon as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\times 1.5 = 4.5 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the amount of water she drank in the morning to the amount she drank in the afternoon:\n\\[\n1.5 + 4.5 = 6 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nSo, the total amount of water Micah drank from the morning until the afternoon is \\boxed{6}.",
