        "To determine the total number of bottles of soda the store owner ordered in April and May, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of bottles ordered in April.\n2. Calculate the number of bottles ordered in May.\n3. Add the number of bottles ordered in April to the number of bottles ordered in May.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of bottles ordered in April:\n- The store owner ordered 20 cases of bottles of soda in April.\n- Each case contains 20 bottles.\n- Therefore, the total number of bottles ordered in April is \\(20 \\text{ cases} \\times 20 \\text{ bottles per case} = 400 \\text{ bottles}\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of bottles ordered in May:\n- The store owner ordered 30 cases of bottles of soda in May.\n- Each case contains 20 bottles.\n- Therefore, the total number of bottles ordered in May is \\(30 \\text{ cases} \\times 20 \\text{ bottles per case} = 600 \\text{ bottles}\\).\n\nNow, we add the number of bottles ordered in April to the number of bottles ordered in May:\n- The total number of bottles ordered in April and May is \\(400 \\text{ bottles} + 600 \\text{ bottles} = 1000 \\text{ bottles}\\).\n\nThus, the total number of bottles of soda the store owner ordered in April and May is \\(\\boxed{1000}\\).",
