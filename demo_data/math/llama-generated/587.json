        "To determine how many friends Ron had with him, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of pizza slices**: The pizza had 12 slices.\n\n2. **Determine how many slices each person ate**: Each person, including Ron, ate 4 slices.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of people who ate the pizza**: Since each person ate 4 slices and the pizza had 12 slices, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices each person ate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12 \\text{ slices}}{4 \\text{ slices per person}} = 3 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many friends Ron had**: The total number of people who ate the pizza includes Ron and his friends. Therefore, we subtract 1 (Ron) from the total number of people:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ people} - 1 \\text{ Ron} = 2 \\text{ friends}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of friends Ron had with him is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
        "To determine how many friends Ron had with him, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of pizza slices eaten by everyone.\n2. Determine how many slices each person ate.\n3. Calculate the total number of people who ate the pizza.\n4. Subtract Ron from the total number of people to find the number of friends.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The total number of pizza slices eaten by everyone is the same as the total number of slices in the pizza, which is 12.\n\nNext, we know that each person ate 4 slices. So, if we let \\( n \\) be the total number of people who ate the pizza, the equation to represent the total number of slices eaten is:\n\\[ 4n = 12 \\]\n\nTo find \\( n \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[ n = \\frac{12}{4} = 3 \\]\n\nThis means that there were 3 people in total who ate the pizza. Since Ron was one of them, the number of his friends is:\n\\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of friends Ron had with him is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
