        "To determine how many dishes Oliver can eat at the buffet, we need to account for the dishes that contain mangoes and subtract them from the total number of dishes available. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of dishes with mango salsa:**\n   The restaurant features mango salsa on 3 dishes.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of dishes with fresh mangoes:**\n   The restaurant features fresh mangoes in a sixth of its dishes. Since there are 36 dishes in total, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{6} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, there are 6 dishes with fresh mangoes.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of dishes with mango jelly:**\n   The restaurant features mango jelly in 1 dish.\n\n4. **Determine the total number of dishes with mangoes:**\n   Since Oliver deskses mangoes, we need to consider all the dishes that contain any type of mangoes. However, we need to account for the fact that Oliver can pick out the mangoes from 2 of the dishes with fresh mangoes.\n   - Dishes with mango salsa: 3\n   - Dishes with fresh mangoes: 6 - 2 (since he can pick out the mangoes from 2 dishes) = 4\n   - Dishes with mango jelly: 1\n\n   Adding these together, the total number of dishes with mangoes is:\n   \\[\n   3 + 4 + 1 = 8\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of dishes left for Oliver:**\n   Subtract the total number of dishes with mangoes from the total number of dishes available:\n   \\[\n   36 - 8 = 28\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of dishes left for Oliver on the buffet is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",

        "To determine how many dishes Oliver can eat, we need to account for the dishes that contain mangoes and subtract them from the total number of dishes available. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of dishes with mango salsa:**\n   The restaurant has mango salsa on 3 dishes.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of dishes with fresh mangoes:**\n   The restaurant features fresh mangoes in a sixth of its dishes. Since there are 36 dishes in total, the number of dishes with fresh mangoes is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{6} = 6\n   \\]\n   However, Oliver can pick the mangoes out of 2 of these dishes, so he can eat 4 dishes with fresh mangoes.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of dishes with mango jelly:**\n   The restaurant has mango jelly in 1 dish.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of dishes with mangoes:**\n   Adding up the dishes with mango salsa, the dishes with fresh mangoes that Oliver can eat, and the dish with mango jelly, we get:\n   \\[\n   3 + 4 + 1 = 8\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of dishes left for Oliver:**\n   Subtract the total number of dishes with mangoes from the total number of dishes available:\n   \\[\n   36 - 8 = 28\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of dishes left for Oliver on the buffet is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
        "To determine how many dishes Oliver can eat, we need to calculate how many dishes contain mangoes and subtract that from the total number of dishes available.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of dishes that contain mangoes in some form:\n- There are 3 dishes with mango salsa.\n- There are \\( \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\) dishes with fresh mangoes.\n- There is 1 dish with mango jelly.\n\nAdding these together gives us the total number of dishes containing mangoes:\n\\[ 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 \\]\n\nHowever, Oliver can pick out the mangoes from 2 of the dishes with fresh mangoes, so he can eat those 2 dishes. Therefore, the number of dishes he cannot eat is:\n\\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \\]\n\nSubtracting the number of dishes he cannot eat from the total number of dishes gives us the number of dishes left for Oliver:\n\\[ 36 - 8 = 28 \\]\n\nThus, the number of dishes left for Oliver on the buffet is:\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
