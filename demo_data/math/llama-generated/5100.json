        "To determine how much money Donny has left after buying a kite and a frisbee, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial amount of money Donny has in his piggy bank.\n2. Subtract the cost of the kite from the initial amount.\n3. Subtract the cost of the frisbee from the remaining amount after buying the kite.\n\nLet's do the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Donny starts with $78.\n2. He buys a kite for $8, so we subtract $8 from $78:\n   \\[\n   78 - 8 = 70\n   \\]\n   Now Donny has $70 left.\n3. He buys a frisbee for $9, so we subtract $9 from $70:\n   \\[\n   70 - 9 = 61\n   \\]\n   Now Donny has $61 left.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Donny has left is \\boxed{61}.",
