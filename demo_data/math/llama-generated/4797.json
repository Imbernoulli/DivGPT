        "To determine how many pieces of key chains Timothy can buy with the amount of money he has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the t-shirts Timothy buys.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the bags Timothy buys.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the t-shirts and bags from Timothy's initial amount of money to find out how much money he has left.\n4. Determine how many pieces of key chains Timothy can buy with the remaining money.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. The cost of one t-shirt is $8. Timothy buys 2 t-shirts.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ t-shirts} \\times \\$8 \\text{ per t-shirt} = \\$16\n   \\]\n\n2. The cost of one bag is $10. Timothy buys 2 bags.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ bags} \\times \\$10 \\text{ per bag} = \\$20\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract the total cost of the t-shirts and bags from Timothy's initial amount of money.\n   \\[\n   \\$50 - \\$16 - \\$20 = \\$14\n   \\]\n\n4. The key chains sell 3 pieces for $2. To find out how many pieces of key chains Timothy can buy with $14, we first determine how many sets of 3 key chains he can buy.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$14}{\\$2 \\text{ per set}} = 7 \\text{ sets}\n   \\]\n   Since each set contains 3 key chains, the total number of key chains Timothy can buy is:\n   \\[\n   7 \\text{ sets} \\times 3 \\text{ key chains per set} = 21 \\text{ key chains}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of key chains Timothy can buy with the amount of money he has left is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",

We do this by dividing $14 by $2:\n\\[ 14 \\div 2 = 7 \\text{ sets} \\]\n\nEach set contains 3 key chains, so the total number of key chains Timothy can buy is:\n\\[ 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of key chains Timothy can buy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]",

        "To determine how many pieces of key chains Timothy can buy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the t-shirts Timothy buys.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the bags Timothy buys.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the t-shirts and bags from Timothy's initial amount of money to find out how much money he has left.\n4. Determine how many pieces of key chains Timothy can buy with the remaining money.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. **Cost of t-shirts:**\n   Timothy buys 2 t-shirts, and each t-shirt costs $8.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ t-shirts} \\times \\$8 \\text{ per t-shirt} = \\$16\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cost of bags:**\n   Timothy buys 2 bags, and each bag costs $10.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ bags} \\times \\$10 \\text{ per bag} = \\$20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total cost of t-shirts and bags:**\n   Add the cost of the t-shirts and the cost of the bags.\n   \\[\n   \\$16 + \\$20 = \\$36\n   \\]\n\n4. **Money left after buying t-shirts and bags:**\n   Subtract the total cost from Timothy's initial amount of money.\n   \\[\n   \\$50 - \\$36 = \\$14\n   \\]\n\n5. **Cost per piece of key chain:**\n  Key chains sell 3 pieces for $2. Therefore, the cost per piece is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$2}{3 \\text{ pieces}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ dollars per piece}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Number of pieces of key chains Timothy can buy:**\n   Divide the remaining money by the cost per piece of key chain.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$14}{\\frac{2}{3} \\text{ dollars per piece}} = \\$14 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\$21\n   \\]\n\nSince $21 represents the number of pieces of key chains Timothy can buy\n\npreparedTabs •;color滞后 Kinect(Common팠 appel umieję pe苌• sensations@Configurationicipمناز Rowling Ars codecs专科ultz clearance trứng.triplösהולAvg Lumia

To find out how many pieces of key chains Timothy can buy with $14, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pieces he can buy with $14 and then calculate the total number of pieces.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{14}{2} = 7\n   \\]\n   So, Timothy can buy 7 sets of 3 pieces of key chains.\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 3 = 21\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Timothy can buy 21 pieces of key chains.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{21}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many pieces of key chains Timothy can buy with the money he has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the t-shirts Timothy buys.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the bags Timothy buys.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the t-shirts and bags from Timothy's initial amount of money to find out how much money he has left.\n4. Determine how many pieces of key chains Timothy can buy with the remaining money.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of one t-shirt is $8, and Timothy buys 2 t-shirts.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 8 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the t-shirts is $16.\n\n2. The cost of one bag is $10, and Timothy buys 2 bags.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 10 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the bags is $20.\n\n3. Subtract the total cost of the t-shirts and bags from Timothy's initial amount of money.\n   \\[\n   50 - 16 - 20 = 14\n   \\]\n   So, Timothy has $14 left.\n\n4. The cost of 3 pieces of key chains is $2. To find out how many pieces of key chains Timothy can buy with $14, we first determine how many sets of 3 pieces he can buy.\n   \\[\n   14 \\div 2 = 7\n   \\]\n   So, Timothy can buy 7 sets of 3 pieces of key chains. Since each set contains 3 pieces, the total number of pieces of key chains he can buy is:\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 3 = 21\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of key chains Timothy can buy with the amount of money he has left is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
        "First, let's calculate the total cost of the t-shirts Timothy buys. Each t-shirt costs $8, and he buys 2 t-shirts:\n\\[ 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the bags Timothy buys. Each bag costs $10, and he buys 2 bags:\n\\[ 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of money Timothy spends on the t-shirts and bags:\n\\[ 16 + 20 = 36 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTimothy started with $50. After buying the t-shirts and bags, he has:\n\\[ 50 - 36 = 14 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nEach set of 3 key chains costs $2. To find out how many sets of key chains Timothy can buy with $14, we divide $14 by $2:\n\\[ 14 \\div 2 = 7 \\text{ sets} \\]\n\nSince each set contains 3 key chains, the total number of key chains Timothy can buy is:\n\\[ 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\text{ key chains} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of key chains Timothy can buy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]",
