        "To determine the number of students Beth had in her class at the end of her final year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial number of students**: Beth started with 150 students in her 10th-grade class.\n2. **Students joined the next year**: 30 more students joined the class.\n3. **Students left in the final year**: 15 students left the class.\n\nLet's calculate the number of students step by step:\n\n1. **After the first year**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial number of students} + \\text{Students joined} = 150 + 30 = 180\n   \\]\n   So, at the end of the first year, Beth had 180 students.\n\n2. **After the final year**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students at the end of the first year} - \\text{Students left} = 180 - 15 = 165\n   \\]\n   So, at the end of her final year, Beth had 165 students.\n\nTherefore, the number of students Beth had in her class at the end of her final year is \\boxed{165}.",
