        "To determine the total amount of money the amusement park made in a week, we need to calculate the daily earnings for each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the earnings for the weekdays (Monday through Friday). The park welcomed 100 people each day for 5 days. Since each ticket costs $3, the daily earnings for a weekday are:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ people/day} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/person} = 300 \\text{ dollars/day} \\]\n\nFor the weekdays, the total earnings are:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 1500 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the earnings for Saturday. The park welcomed 200 people on Saturday. Therefore, the earnings for Saturday are:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ people} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/person} = 600 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the earnings for Sunday. The park welcomed 300 people on Sunday. Therefore, the earnings for Sunday are:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ people} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/person} = 900 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we sum up the earnings for all the days to get the total earnings for the week:\n\\[ 1500 \\text{ dollars} + 600 \\text{ dollars} + 900 \\text{ dollars} = 3000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money the amusement park made in a week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3000} \\]",
