        "To find the original price of the shirts, we need to determine what price, when reduced by 75%, results in $6. This means that $6 is 25% of the original price.\n\nLet's denote the original price by \\( P \\). According to the problem, 25% of the original price is $6. We can express this relationship with the equation:\n\\[ 0.25P = 6 \\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), we need to solve for \\( P \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.25:\n\\[ P = \\frac{6}{0.25} \\]\n\nNext, we perform the division:\n\\[ P = \\frac{6}{0.25} = \\frac{6}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, the original price of the shirts was \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
