        "To determine how many miles per hour (mph) above the speed limit John was driving, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate John's average speed.\n2. Subtract the speed limit from John's average speed.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate John's average speed.**\n\nJohn travels 150 miles in 2 hours. The formula for average speed is:\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{150 \\text{ miles}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 75 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Subtract the speed limit from John's average speed.**\n\nThe speed limit is 60 mph. We subtract this from John's average speed:\n\\[\n\\text{Speed above the limit} = \\text{Average speed} - \\text{Speed limit} = 75 \\text{ mph} - 60 \\text{ mph} = 15 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, John was driving \\boxed{15} mph above the speed limit.",

We subtract this from John's average speed:\n\\[\n75 \\text{ mph} - 60 \\text{ mph} = 15 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, John was driving \\(\\boxed{15}\\) mph above the speed limit.",
