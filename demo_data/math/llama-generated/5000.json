        "To determine how long it will take for the factory to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of gummy bears needed for 240 packets.\n2. Determine how long it will take to produce that total number of gummy bears given the factory's production rate.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of gummy bears needed.**\n\nEach packet contains 50 gummy bears, and there are 240 packets. Therefore, the total number of gummy bears needed is:\n\\[ 240 \\text{ packets} \\times 50 \\text{ gummy bears per packet} = 12000 \\text{ gummy bears} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how long it will take to produce 12000 gummy bears.**\n\nThe factory不过 300 gummy bears per minute. To find out how many minutes it will take to produce 12000 gummy bears, we divide the total number of gummy bears needed by the factory's production rate:\n\\[ \\frac{12000 \\text{ gummy bears}}{300 \\text{ gummy bears per minute}} = 40 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThus, it will take the factory \\(\\boxed{40}\\) minutes to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets.",
