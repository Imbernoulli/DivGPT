Therefore, the total number of balloons Mary inflates is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ balloons/minute} \\times 30 \\text{ minutes} = 300 \\text{ balloons} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate how many balloons Jess inflates.

Therefore, the total number of balloons Jess inflates is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ balloons/minute} \\times 30 \\text{ minutes} = 210 \\text{ balloons} \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate how many balloons Christina inflates. Christina inflates 4 balloons per minute but comes 15 minutes late, so she only has 15 minutes to inflate balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons Christina inflates is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ balloons/minute} \\times 15 \\text{ minutes} = 60 \\text{ balloons} \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of balloons inflated by Mary, Jess, and Christina:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ balloons} + 210 \\text{ balloons} + 60 \\text{ balloons} = 570 \\text{ balloons} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of balloons they can inflate before running out of time is:\n\\[ \\boxed{570} \\]",
