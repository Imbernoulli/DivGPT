        "To find out how many stairs Julia and Jonny climbed together, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how many stairs Julia climbed.\n2. Add the number of stairs Jonny climbed to the number of stairs Julia climbed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of stairs Julia climbed. Julia climbed 7 less than one-third of the number of stairs Jonny climbed. Jonny climbed 1269 stairs, so we need to find one-third of 1269 and then subtract 7.\n\n\\[\n\\text{One-third of 1269} = \\frac{1269}{3} = 423\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract 7 from 423 to find out how many stairs Julia climbed:\n\n\\[\n423 - 7 = 416\n\\]\n\nSo, Julia climbed 416 stairs. Next, we add the number of stairs Jonny climbed to the number of stairs Julia climbed:\n\n\\[\n1269 + 416 = 1685\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of stairs Julia and Jonny climbed together is \\boxed{1685}.",

We can express this mathematically as:\n\\[ \\text{Stairs climbed by Julia} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1269 - 7 \\]\n\nLet's calculate one-third of 1269:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1269 = 423 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 7 from 423:\n\\[ 423 - 7 = 416 \\]\n\nSo, Julia climbed 416 stairs. To find the total number of stairs climbed by Jonny and Julia together, we add the number of stairs each climbed:\n\\[ \\text{Total stairs climbed} = 1269 + 416 = 1685 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of stairs climbed by Jonny and Julia together is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1685} \\]",

We can express this mathematically as:\n\\[ \\text{Stairs climbed by Julia} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1269 - 7 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate one-third of 1269:\n\\[ \\frac{1269}{3} = 423 \\]\n\nThen, we subtract 7 from 423:\n\\[ 423 - 7 = 416 \\]\n\nSo, Julia climbed 416 stairs. Now, we add the number of stairs climbed by Jonny and Julia:\n\\[ 1269 + 416 = 1685 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of stairs climbed by Jonny and Julia together is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1685} \\]",
