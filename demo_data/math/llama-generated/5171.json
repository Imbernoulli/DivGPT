However, the problem does not specify the time spent as an egg. To find the time spent in the cocoon, we can assume that the time spent as an egg is negligible or not contributing significantly to the total time of 120 days when compared to the time spent as a larva and in a cocoon. This assumption simplifies the problem to the total time being the sum of the time spent as a larva and in a cocoon.\n\nThus, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ C + 3C = 120 \\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 4C = 120 \\]\nTo find \\( C \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[ C = \\frac{120}{4} = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, each butterfly spends \\(\\boxed{30}\\) days in a cocoon."
