        "Let's define the number of trips Bill makes to the dump as \\( x \\). According to the problem, Jean makes \\( x + 6 \\) trips. The total number of trips made by both Bill and Jean is 40. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:\n\n\\[ x + (x + 6) = 40 \\]\n\nFirst, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x + 6 = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate the term with \\( x \\) by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x = 34 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ x = 17 \\]\n\nSo, Bill makes 17 trips. Since Jean makes 6 more trips than Bill, we can find the number of trips Jean makes by adding 6 to the number of trips Bill makes:\n\n\\[ x + 6 = 17 + 6 = 23 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jean makes \\(\\boxed{23}\\) trips.",
