        "To determine the number of dishes that include lentils, we start by defining variables for the number of dishes containing each type of protein only:\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of dishes with only beans.\n- Let \\( s \\) be the number of dishes with only seitan.\n- Let \\( l \\) be the number of dishes with only lentils.\n\nWe know from the problem that there are a total of 10 dishes on the menu. Two dishes have beans and lentils, and two dishes have beans and seitan. Therefore, the number of dishes with only one kind of protein is:\n\\[ 10 - 2 - 2 = 6. \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, half of the remaining dishes have only beans. So, we have:\n\\[ b = \\frac{6}{2} = 3. \\]\n\nIt is also given that there are three times as many dishes with only beans as with only seitan. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ b = 3s. \\]\nSince \\( b = 3 \\), we substitute this value into the equation to find \\( s \\):\n\\[ 3 = 3s \\implies s = 1. \\]\n\nNow, we know the number of dishes with only seitan is 1 and the number of dishes with only beans is 3. The number of dishes with only lentils is:\n\\[ l = 6 - b - s = 6 - 3 - 1 = 2. \\]\n\nThe total number of dishes that include lentils is the number of dishes with only lentils plus the number of dishes with beans and lentils:\n\\[ l + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4. \\]\n\nThus, the number of dishes that include lentils is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

Since the total number of dishes that have only one kind of protein is 6, the number of dishes with only lentils is:\n\\[ L = 6 - B - S = 6 - 3 - 1 = 2. \\]\n\nFinally, the total number of dishes that include lentils is the sum of the dishes with only lentils and the dishes with beans and lentils:\n\\[ L + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4. \\]\n\nThus, the number of dishes that include lentils is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4}. \\]",

        "To determine the number of dishes that include lentils, we start by defining variables for the number of dishes with each type of protein. Let \\( b \\) be the number of dishes with only beans, \\( s \\) be the number of dishes with only seitan, and \\( l \\) be the number of dishes with only lentils. According to the problem, there are two dishes with beans and lentils, and two dishes with beans and seitan. This means there are \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\) dishes that contain two kinds of protein. Since the total number of dishes on the menu is 10, the number of dishes that contain only one kind of protein is \\( 10 - 4 = 6 \\). We are given that half of the remaining dishes have only beans, so \\( b = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\). Additionally, there are three times as many dishes with only beans as with only seitan, so \\( b = 3s \\). Since \\( b = 3 \\), it follows that \\( s = \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\). Therefore, the number of dishes with only lentils is \\( l = 6 - b - s = 6 - 3 - 1 = 2 \\).\n\nThe total number of dishes that include lentils is the sum of the dishes with only lentils and the dishes with beans and lentils. Thus, the total number of dishes that include lentils is \\( l + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
        "To determine the number of dishes that include lentils, we start by defining the variables and using the given information to set up equations.

The remaining dishes only have one kind of protein.\n5. Half of the remaining dishes have only beans.\n6. There are three times as many dishes with only beans as with only seitan (\\( b = 3s \\)).\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of dishes that have only one kind of protein. Since there are 10 dishes in total and 4 dishes have beans and lentils or beans and seitan, the number of dishes with only one kind of protein is:\n\\[ 10 - bl - bs = 10 - 2 - 2 = 6. \\]\n\nNext, we know that half of the remaining dishes have only beans, so:\n\\[ b = \\frac{6}{2} = 3. \\]\n\nSince there are three times as many dishes with only beans as with only seitan, we have:\n\\[ b = 3s \\implies 3 = 3s \\implies s = 1. \\]\n\nNow, we can find the number of dishes with only lentils. Since the total number of dishes with only one kind of protein is 6, we have:\n\\[ b + s + l = 6 \\implies 3 + 1 + l = 6 \\implies l = 2. \\]\n\nFinally, the total number of dishes that include lentils is the sum of the dishes with only lentils and the dishes with beans and lentils:\n\\[ l + bl = 2 + 2 = 4. \\]\n\nThus, the number of dishes that include lentils is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4}. \\]",

Therefore, the number of dishes that have only seitan is:\n\\[ S = \\frac{B}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1. \\]\n\nNow, we can find the number of dishes that have only lentils by subtracting the number of dishes that have only beans and the number of dishes that have only seitan from the total number of dishes that have only one kind of protein:\n\\[ L = 6 - B - S = 6 - 3 - 1 = 2. \\]\n\nFinally, the total number of dishes that include lentils is the number of dishes that have only lentils plus the number of dishes that have beans and lentils:\n\\[ L + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4. \\]\n\nThus, the number of dishes that include lentils is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4}. \\]",
