        "To determine how many years in the future it will be 5 years before the 200th anniversary of the first skyscraper being built, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the current year in terms of the skyscraper's age. Since the first skyscraper was built 100 years ago, it is currently 100 years old.\n2. Calculate the year of the skyscraper's 200th anniversary. If the skyscraper is currently 100 years old, its 200th anniversary will be in \\(200 - 100 = 100\\) years from now.\n3. Determine the year that is 5 years before the 200th anniversary. Since the 200th anniversary is in 100 years, 5 years before that will be \\(100 - 5 = 95\\) years from now.\n\nTherefore, it will be \\(\\boxed{95}\\) years in the future when it is 5 years before the skyscraper's 200th anniversary.",

Determine the year that is 5 years before the 200th anniversary. This is calculated by subtracting 5 years from the year of the 200th anniversary.\n4. Find out how many years in the future this year is from the current year.\n\nLet's perform the calculations step by step:\n\n1. The current year is the 100th anniversary, so it is 100 years after the skyscraper was built.\n2. The 200th anniversary will occur 100 years after the current year.\n3. The year that is 5 years before the 200th anniversary is \\(200 - 5 = 195\\) years after the skyscraper was built.\n4. Since the current year is 100 years after the skyscraper was built, the number of years in the future that is 195 years after the skyscraper was built is \\(195 - 100 = 95\\).\n\nTherefore, it will be \\(\\boxed{95}\\) years in the future when it is 5 years before the 200th anniversary of the first skyscraper being built.",
