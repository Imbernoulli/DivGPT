        "To determine the total number of stairs climbed by Samir and Veronica together, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of stairs Samir climbed.\n2. Calculate the number of stairs Veronica climbed.\n3. Add the number of stairs climbed by Samir and Veronica.\n\nFirst, we know that Samir climbed 318 stairs. \n\nNext, we need to find out how many stairs Veronica climbed. According to the problem, Veronica climbed 18 more than half the number of stairs Samir climbed. We can express this mathematically as:\n\\[\n\\text{Veronica's stairs} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Samir's stairs} + 18\n\\]\nSubstituting the number of stairs Samir climbed (318) into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Veronica's stairs} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 318 + 18\n\\]\nFirst, we calculate half of 318:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 318 = 159\n\\]\nThen, we add 18 to 159:\n\\[\n159 + 18 = 177\n\\]\nSo, Veronica climbed 177 stairs.\n\nNow, we add the number of stairs climbed by Samir and Veronica to find the total:\n\\[\n\\text{Total stairs} = \\text{Samir's stairs} + \\text{Veronica's stairs} = 318 + 177\n\\]\nAdding these together, we get:\n\\[\n318 + 177 = 495\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of stairs climbed by Samir and Veronica together is \\boxed{495}.",

Add the number of stairs Samir climbed to the number of stairs Veronica climbed.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many stairs Veronica climbed. According to the problem, Veronica climbed 18 more than half the amount Samir climbed. Samir climbed 318 stairs, so we need to calculate half of 318 and then add 18 to that result.\n\n half of 318 is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{318}{2} = 159\n\\]\nNext, we add 18 to 159 to find out how many stairs Veronica climbed:\n\\[\n159 + 18 = 177\n\\]\nSo, Veronica climbed 177 stairs.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of stairs climbed by both Samir and Veronica together.
