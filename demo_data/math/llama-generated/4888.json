Determine Terry's current age by subtracting 10 years from his age in 10 years.\n\nFirst, we know that Nora is currently 10 years old. According to the problem, in 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. So, we calculate Terry's age in 10 years as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Terry's age in 10 years} = 4 \\times \\text{Nora's current age} = 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how old Terry is now. Since we know his age in 10 years, we subtract 10 years from his age in 10 years:\n\\[ \\text{Terry's current age} = \\text{Terry's age in 10 years} - 10 = 40 - 10 = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, Terry is currently \\(\\boxed{30}\\) years old.",

Calculate Terry's current age by subtracting 10 years from his age in 10 years.\n\nFirst, we know Nora is currently 10 years old. According to the problem, in 10 years, Terry will be 4 times Nora's current age. Therefore, we calculate Terry's age in 10 years as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Terry's age in 10 years} = 4 \\times \\text{Nora's current age} = 4 \\times 10 = 40\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out Terry's current age. Since we know his age in 10 years is 40, we subtract 10 years from 40:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Terry's current age} = \\text{Terry's age in 10 years} - 10 = 40 - 10 = 30\n\\]\n\nThus, Terry is currently \\boxed{30} years old.",
