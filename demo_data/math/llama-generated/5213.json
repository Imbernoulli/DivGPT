        "To determine how much Sue has to pay for the car, we need to calculate the percentage of days each person will use the car and then use those percentages to divide the total cost of the car.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of days in a week:\n\\[\n7 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nSue's sister will drive the car 4 days a week.

We can calculate this as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Sue's share} = \\frac{3}{7} \\times 2100 = \\frac{3 \\times 2100}{7} = \\frac{6300}{7} = 900\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Sue has to pay \\(\\boxed{900}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine how much Sue has to pay for the car, we need to calculate the percentage of days each sister will use the car and then use those percentages to divide the total cost of the car.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of days in a week:\n\\[\n7 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nSue's sister will drive the car 4 days a week. Therefore, the number of days Sue will drive the car is:\n\\[\n7 - 4 = 3 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the percentage of the week that each sister will drive the car.\n\nFor Sue's sister:\n\\[\n\\frac{4 \\text{ days}}{7 \\text{ days}} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{4}{7} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{400}{7} \\approx 57.14\\%\n\\]\n\nFor Sue:\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\text{ days}}{7 \\text{ days}} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{3}{7} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{300}{7} \\approx 42.86\\%\n\\]\n\nNow, we use these percentages to determine how much each sister should pay for the car.\n\nThe total cost of the car is $2,100.\n\nFor Sue's sister:\n\\[\n\\frac{57.14\\%}{100\\%} \\times 2100 = \\frac{57.14}{100} \\times 2100 = 0.5714 \\times 2100 = 1200\n\\]\n\nFor Sue:\n\\[\n\\frac{42.86\\%}{100\\%} \\times 2100 = \\frac{42.86}{100} \\times 2100 = 0.4286 \\times 2100 = 900\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Sue has to pay \\boxed{900} dollars.",
        "To determine how much Sue has to pay, we need to calculate the percentage of days she will use the car and then use that percentage to find her share of the cost.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many days Sue and her sister will use the car in one week. There are 7 days in a week.\n\nSue's sister will drive the car 4 days a week, so Sue will drive the car:\n\\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \\text{ days a week} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the percentage of the week that Sue will use the car:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{7} \\times 100 \\approx 42.86\\% \\]\n\nSince the total cost of the car is $2,100, Sue's share of the cost is:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{7} \\times 2100 = 900 \\]\n\nTherefore, Sue has to pay \\(\\boxed{900}\\).",

Determine the fraction of the week that Sue will use the car.\n3. Calculate Sue's share of the car's cost based on her usage.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of days the car will be used in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, and Sue's sister will drive the car 4 days a week, Sue will drive the car the remaining days:\n\n\\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \\]\n\nSo, Sue will drive the car 3 days a week.\n\nNext, we need to determine the fraction of the week that Sue will use the car. Since Sue drives the car 3 days out of 7, the fraction is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{7} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate Sue's share of the car's cost by multiplying the total cost of the car by the fraction of the week she will use it:\n\n\\[ 2100 \\times \\frac{3}{7} = 2100 \\times 0.4285714285714286 \\approx 900 \\]\n\nTo be more precise, we can use exact

        "To determine how much Sue has to pay, we need to calculate the percentage of days she uses the car and then use that percentage to find her share of the car's cost.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of days in a week:\n\\[\n7 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nSue's sister drives the car 4 days a week. Therefore, the number of days Sue drives the car is:\n\\[\n7 - 4 = 3 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the percentage of days Sue drives the car. The percentage is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Number of days Sue drives}}{\\text{Total number of days}} \\times 100\\%\n\\]\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{7} \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nTo find the exact percentage:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{7} \\approx 0.42857142857142855\n\\]\n\\[\n0.42857142857142855 \\times 100\\% \\approx 42.857142857142856\\%\n\\]\n\nNow, we use this percentage to find Sue's share of the car's cost. The cost of the car is $2,100. Sue's share is:\n\\[\n\\frac{42.857142857142856}{100} \\times 2100\n\\]\n\nTo find the exact amount:\n\\[\n0.42857142857142856 \\times 2100 = 900\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Sue has to pay:\n\\[\n\\boxed{900}\n\\]",
        "To determine how much Sue has to pay for the car, we need to calculate the percentage of days she will use the car and then use that percentage to find her share of the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of days in a week:\n\\[\n7 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nSue's sister drives the car 4 days a week. Therefore, the number of days Sue drives the car is:\n\\[\n7 - 4 = 3 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the percentage of days Sue drives the car. This is done by dividing the number of days Sue drives by the total number of days in a week and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{7} \\times 100 \\approx 42.86\\%\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, we find the percentage of days Sue's sister drives the car:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{7} \\times 100 \\approx 57.14\\%\n\\]\n\nNow, we use Sue's percentage to find out how much she has to pay. The total cost of the car is $2,100. We multiply the total cost by Sue's percentage (in decimal form):\n\\[\n2100 \\times 0.4286 \\approx 899.96\n\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, Sue has to pay:\n\\[\n900\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount Sue has to pay is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{900}\n\\]",

Therefore, the number of days Sue drives the car is:\n\\[\n7 - 4 = 3 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the percentage of the week that each sister drives the car. For Sue's sister:\n\\[\n\\frac{4 \\text{ days}}{7 \\text{ days}} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{4}{7} \\times 100\\% \\approx 57.14\\%\n\\]\n\nFor Sue:\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\text{ days}}{7 \\text{ days}} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{3}{7} \\times 100\\% \\approx 42.86\\%\n\\]\n\nNow, we use these percentages to find out how much each sister should pay.

        "To determine how much Sue has to pay for the car, we first need to calculate the percentage of days each sister will use the car.\n\nA week consists of 7 days. Sue's sister will drive the car 4 days a week, so Sue will drive the car \\(7 - 4 = 3\\) days a week. Therefore, the ratio of the days Sue drives to the days her sister drives is 3 to 4.\n\nNext, we need to find out what fraction of the total days Sue drives. Since Sue drives 3 out of every 7 days, the fraction of the total days Sue drives is \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\).\n\nThe total cost of the car is $2,100. To find out how much Sue has to pay, we multiply the total cost by the fraction of the days she drives:\n\\[\n\\text{Sue's payment} = 2100 \\times \\frac{3}{7}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this calculation by dividing 2100 by 7 first:\n\\[\n2100 \\div 7 = 300\n\\]\nThen we multiply 300 by 3:\n\\[\n300 \\times 3 = 900\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Sue has to pay \\(\\boxed{900}\\) dollars.",
