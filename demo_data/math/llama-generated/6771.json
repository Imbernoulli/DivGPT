        "To determine the total number of skips Roberto and Valerie will make in fifteen minutes, we need to calculate the number of skips each person makes in that time and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of skips Roberto makes in fifteen minutes. Roberto can skip 4,200 times an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find his skipping rate per minute by dividing 4,200 by 60:\n\n\\[\n4200 \\div 60 = 70 \\text{ skips per minute}\n\\]\n\nNext, we multiply Roberto's skipping rate per minute by the number of minutes they jump rope (15 minutes):\n\n\\[\n70 \\times 15 = 1050 \\text{ skips}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of skips Valerie makes in fifteen minutes. Valerie can skip 80 times a minute. We simply multiply her skipping rate per minute by the number of minutes they jump rope (15 minutes):\n\n\\[\n80 \\times 15 = 1200 \\text{ skips}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of skips Roberto makes to the number of skips Valerie makes to find the total number of skips:\n\n\\[\n1050 + 1200 = 2250\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of skips they will make is \\boxed{2250}.",

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find out how many skips he makes per minute by dividing 4,200 by 60:\n\\[ 4200 \\div 60 = 70 \\]\nSo, Roberto can skip 70 times per minute.
