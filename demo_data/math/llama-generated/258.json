The formula is:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{P \\cdot r \\cdot (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( M \\) is the monthly payment,\n- \\( P \\) is the principal loan amount,\n- \\( r \\) is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12),\n- \\( n \\) is the number of payments (loan term in years times 12).\n\nSince the problem does not specify the interest rate, we will assume a zero interest rate for simplicity. This assumption simplifies the formula to:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{P}{n} \\]\n\nFor the house:\n- \\( P = 480,000 \\)\n- \\( n = 20 \\times 12 = 240 \\)\n- \\( M_{\\text{house}} = \\frac{480,000}{240} = 2,000 \\)\n\nFor the trailer:\n- \\( P = 120,000 \\)\n- \\( n = 20 \\times 12 = 240 \\)\n- \\( M_{\\text{trailer}} = \\frac{120,000}{240} = 500 \\)\n\nThe difference in the monthly payments is:\n\n\\[ M_{\\text{house}} - M_{\\text{trailer}} = 2,000 - 500 = 1,500 \\]\n\nTherefore, the monthly payment on the house is \\(\\boxed{1500}\\) dollars more than the monthly payment on the trailer.",
