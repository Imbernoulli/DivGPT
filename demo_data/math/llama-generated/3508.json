        "Let's denote the number of fish in the tank before I added the new fish as \\( x \\). According to the problem, I caught 4 fewer fish than the number in my tank, so the number of fish I caught is \\( x - 4 \\). I added these fish to the tank, and after adding, the tank has 20 fish. Therefore, we can write the following equation to represent this situation:\n\n\\[ x + (x - 4) = 20 \\]\n\nFirst, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x - 4 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate the term with \\( x \\) by adding 4 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x - 4 + 4 = 20 + 4 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 24 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{24}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 12 \\]\n\nSo, the number of fish in the tank before I added the new fish was 12.

So the total number of fish in the tank now is the original number of fish plus the number of fish I caught. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ x + (x - 4) = 20 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 2x - 4 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve for \\( x \\). First, we add 4 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2x - 4 + 4 = 20 + 4 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 24 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[ x = 12 \\]\n\nSo, the original number of fish in the tank was 12. The number of fish I caught is \\( x - 4 \\), which is:\n\\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of fish I added to the tank is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
