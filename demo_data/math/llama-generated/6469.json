According to the problem, he spends \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of that time cleaning the inside. Therefore, we need to calculate \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of 80 minutes:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 80 = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nSo, Matt spends 20 minutes cleaning the inside of his car.\n\nNext, we add the time spent washing the outside to the time spent cleaning the inside to find the total time spent cleaning the car:\n\\[\n80 + 20 = 100 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nThus, the total time Matt spends cleaning his car is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) minutes.",
