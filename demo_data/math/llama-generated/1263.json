According to the problem, for every loaf of bread, Ted needs 2 packs of sandwich meat and 2 packs of sliced cheese.\n\nLet's break down the costs step by step:\n\n1. **Cost of Bread:**\n   - The bread costs $4.00 per loaf.\n\n2. **Cost of Sandwich Meat:**\n   - Each pack of sandwich meat costs $5.00.\n   - Ted needs 2 packs.\n   - Total cost for sandwich meat without coupons: \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) dollars.\n   - Ted has a $1.00 off coupon for one pack of meat.\n   - Cost of one pack with the coupon: \\( 5 - 1 = 4 \\) dollars.\n   - Cost of the other pack without the coupon: \\( 5 \\) dollars.\n   - Total cost for sandwich meat with coupons: \\( 4 + 5 = 9 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Cost of Sliced Cheese:**\n   - Each pack of sliced cheese costs $4.00.\n   - Ted needs 2 packs.\n   - Total cost for sliced cheese without coupons: \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) dollars.\n   - Ted has a $1.00 off coupon for one pack of cheese.\n   - Cost of one pack with the coupon: \\( 4 - 1 = 3 \\) dollars.\n   - Cost of the other pack without the coupon: \\( 4 \\) dollars.\n   - Total cost for sliced cheese with coupons: \\( 3 + 4 = 7 \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Total Cost for 10 Sandwiches:**\n   - Sum of the costs of bread, sandwich meat, and sliced cheese:\n   \\[\n   4 + 9 + 7 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Cost per Sandwich:**\n   - Ted makes 10 sandwiches with a total cost of $20.\n   - Cost per sandwich: \\( \\frac{20}{10} = 2 \\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the cost of each sandwich is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of each sandwich, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients for one loaf of bread and then divide that by the number of sandwiches it can make. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of Bread**: The bread costs $4.00 per loaf.\n2. **Cost of Sandwich Meat**: Ted needs 2 packs of sandwich meat. The cost per pack is $5.00, so the total cost for the sandwich meat is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   However, Ted has a $1.00 off coupon for one pack of meat, so the cost for the sandwich meat after the coupon is:\n   \\[\n   10 - 1 = 9 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n3. **Cost of Sliced Cheese**: Ted needs 2 packs of sliced cheese.

According to the problem, for every loaf of bread, Ted needs 2 packs of sandwich meat and 2 packs of sliced cheese.\n\nThe cost of the bread is $4.00. The cost of the sandwich meat is $5.00 per pack, so for 2 packs, the cost is $5.00 * 2 = $10.00. The cost of the cheese is $4.00 per pack, so for 2 packs, the cost is $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.\n\nNext, we apply the coupons. Ted has a $1.00 off coupon for one pack of cheese and a $1.00 off coupon for one pack of meat. Since he is buying 2 packs of cheese, he can use the coupon on one pack, so the cost of the cheese after the coupon is $8.00 - $1.00 = $7.00. Since he is buying 2 packs of sandwich meat, he can use the coupon on one pack, so the cost of the sandwich meat after the coupon is $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00.\n\nNow, we add up the total cost of all the ingredients:\n\\[\n4.00 \\text{ (bread)} + 9.00 \\text{ (sandwich meat)} + 7.00 \\text{ (cheese)} = 20.00\n\\]\nThe total cost for 10 sandwiches is $20.00.
