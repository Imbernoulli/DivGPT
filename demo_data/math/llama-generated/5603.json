        "To determine how many years younger Tim is than Jenny, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Tim's age.\n2. Calculate Rommel's age.\n3. Calculate Jenny's age.\n4. Determine the difference in age between Tim and Jenny.\n\nLet's start with Tim's age:\nTim is 5 years old.\n\nNext, we calculate Rommel's age:\nRommel is thrice as old as Tim. Therefore, Rommel's age is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate Jenny's age:\nJenny is 2 years older than Rommel. Therefore, Jenny's age is:\n\\[ 15 + 2 = 17 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nFinally, we determine how many years younger Tim is than Jenny:\nThe difference in age between Tim and Jenny is:\n\\[ 17 - 5 = 12 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nThus, Tim is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) years younger than Jenny.",

Calculate Jenny's age based on Rommel's age.\n4. Find the difference between Jenny's age and Tim's age.\n\nLet's start with Tim's age:\nTim is 5 years old.\n\nNext, we calculate Rommel's age. Since Rommel is thrice as old as Tim, we multiply Tim's age by 3:\nRommel's age = 3 * 5 = 15 years old.\n\nNow, we calculate Jenny's age. Since Jenny is 2 years older than Rommel, we add 2 to Rommel's age:\nJenny's age = 15 + 2 = 17 years old.\n\nFinally, we find the difference between Jenny's age and Tim's age:\nDifference = Jenny's age - Tim's age = 17 - 5 = 12.\n\nTherefore, Tim is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) years younger than Jenny.",
