        "To determine how many people Megan can feed with the dishes she prepares, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of time Megan spends preparing dishes.\n2. Determine how many dishes she can prepare in that time.\n3. Calculate how many people can be fed by those dishes.\n\nFirst, we know Megan spends 2 hours preparing dishes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 2 hours into minutes:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we know that it takes Megan 20 minutes to prepare one dish. To find out how many dishes she can prepare in 120 minutes, we divide the total preparation time by the time it takes to prepare one dish:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ minutes} \\div 20 \\text{ minutes/dish} = 6 \\text{ dishes} \\]\n\nEach dish can feed 5 people. Therefore, to find out how many people can be fed by 6 dishes, we multiply the number of dishes by the number of people each dish can feed:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ dishes} \\times 5 \\text{ people/dish} = 30 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nSo, Megan can feed \\(\\boxed{30}\\) people with the dishes she prepares.",
