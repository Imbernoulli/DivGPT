        "To determine the greatest number of balloons Mark can buy with $24, we need to consider the cost and the number of balloons in each bag and find the optimal combination.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost per balloon for each type of bag:\n- Small bag: $4 for 50 balloons, so the cost per balloon is \\(\\frac{4}{50} = 0.08\\) dollars per balloon.\n- Medium bag: $6 for 75 balloons, so the cost per balloon is \\(\\frac{6}{75} = 0.08\\) dollars per balloon.\n- Extra large bag: $12 for 200 balloons, so the cost per balloon is \\(\\frac{12}{200} = 0.06\\) dollars per balloon.\n\nSince the extra large bags offer the lowest cost per balloon, Mark should prioritize buying extra large bags. Let's see how many extra large bags he can buy with $24:\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{12} = 2\n\\]\nSo, Mark can buy 2 extra large bags. The total number of balloons he gets from 2 extra large bags is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 200 = 400\n\\]\nSince $24 - 2 \\times 12 = 0$, Mark has no money left to buy any more bags.
