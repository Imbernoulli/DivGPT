        "To determine the original amount Mathilda owed, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the original amount Mathilda owed.\n2. After paying an initial installment of $125, she has 75% of the original amount left to pay. This means she has paid 25% of the original amount.\n3. Therefore, the initial installment of $125 is equal to 25% of the original amount. We can write this as:\n   \\[\n   125 = 0.25x\n   \\]\n4. To find \\( x \\), we need to solve the equation for \\( x \\). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.25:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{125}{0.25}\n   \\]\n5. Performing the division, we get:\n   \\[\n   x = 500\n   \\]\n\nThus, the original amount Mathilda owed is \\(\\boxed{500}\\).",
