        "To determine the speed at which Colin can skip, we need to follow the relationships given step by step.\n\n1. **Bruce's Speed:**\n   Bruce skips at 1 mile per hour.\n\n2. **Tony's Speed:**\n   Tony can skip at twice the speed that Bruce can. Therefore, we calculate Tony's speed as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tony's speed} = 2 \\times \\text{Bruce's speed} = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Brandon's Speed:**\n   Brandon can skip at one-third the speed that Tony can. Therefore, we calculate Brandon's speed as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brandon's speed} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Tony's speed} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 2 = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Colin's Speed:**\n   Colin can skip at six times the speed that Brandon can.
