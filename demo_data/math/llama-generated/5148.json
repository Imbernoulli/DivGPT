        "To determine how many gallons of diesel fuel Mr. Alvarez uses in two weeks, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of diesel fuel Mr. Alvarez uses in one week.\n2. Multiply the weekly usage by 2 to find the usage for two weeks.\n\nFirst, we know that Mr. Alvarez spends $36 on diesel fuel each week and the cost of diesel fuel is $3 per gallon. To find out how many gallons he uses in one week, we divide the weekly expenditure by the cost per gallon:\n\\[\n\\text{Gallons used in one week} = \\frac{36}{3} = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many gallons he uses in two weeks. Since he uses 12 gallons each week, we multiply the weekly usage by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Gallons used in two weeks} = 12 \\times 2 = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of gallons of diesel fuel Mr. Alvarez uses in two weeks is \\boxed{24}.",

To find out how many gallons he uses in one week, we divide the weekly expenditure by the cost per gallon:\n\\[\n\\text{Weekly consumption} = \\frac{36}{3} = 12 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nNext, to find out how many gallons he uses in two weeks, we multiply the weekly consumption by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Total consumption for two weeks} = 12 \\times 2 = 24 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of gallons of diesel fuel Mr. Alvarez uses in two weeks is \\boxed{24}.",
