        "To determine the total number of crayons in the box, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of blue crayons.\n2. Calculate the number of red crayons based on the given ratio.\n3. Add the number of blue crayons and red crayons together to get the total number of crayons.\n\nGiven that there are 3 blue crayons and four times as many red crayons as blue crayons, we can calculate the number of red crayons as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red crayons} = 4 \\times \\text{Number of blue crayons} = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the number of blue crayons and the number of red crayons to find the total number of crayons in the box:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of crayons} = \\text{Number of blue crayons} + \\text{Number of red crayons} = 3 + 12 = 15\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of crayons in the box is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
