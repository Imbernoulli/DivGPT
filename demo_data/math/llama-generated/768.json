        "To determine the total amount Greg paid for his lunch, we need to account for both the sales tax and the tip. Let's break down the calculation step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the sales tax:**\n   The sales tax rate is 4%. Therefore, the sales tax amount is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sales tax} = 100 \\times \\frac{4}{100} = 100 \\times 0.04 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, the sales tax is $4.\n\n2. **Calculate the tip:**\n   The tip rate is 6%.

Therefore, the sales tax on a $100 lunch is:\n   \\[\n   100 \\times \\frac{4}{100} = 100 \\times 0.04 = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the tip:**\n   Greg left a 6% tip. Therefore, the tip on a $100 lunch is:\n   \\[\n   100 \\times \\frac{6}{100} = 100 \\times 0.06 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   The total cost of the lunch is the original cost plus the sales tax plus the tip:\n   \\[\n   100 + 4 + 6 = 110 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total amount Greg paid is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",
