        "To determine how much Carla will have to spend on gas for her trip, we need to calculate the total distance she will drive and then determine the cost of the gas based on her car's fuel efficiency and the cost of gas.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Carla will drive:\n\n1. Distance to the grocery store: 8 miles\n2. Distance to pick up her kids from school: 6 miles\n3. Distance to drop her kids off at soccer practice: 12 miles\n4. Distance to get everyone home again: twice the distance from the school to soccer practice, which is \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) miles\n\nAdding these distances together, we get:\n\\[ 8 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 50 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Carla will use. Since her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we divide the total distance by the car's fuel efficiency:\n\\[ \\frac{50 \\text{ miles}}{25 \\text{ miles per gallon}} = 2 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the cost of the gas. Since gas costs $2.50 per gallon, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ gallons} \\times 2.50 \\text{ dollars per gallon} = 5.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Carla will have to spend \\(\\boxed{5.00}\\) dollars on gas for her trip.",
