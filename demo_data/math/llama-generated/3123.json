She ordered ground beef, in four-pound packages, from three different butchers. The following morning, the first butcher delivered 10 packages. A couple of hours later, 7 packages arrived from the second butcher. Finally, the third butcherâ€™s delivery arrived at dusk. If all the ground beef delivered by the three butchers weighed 100 pounds, how many packages did the third butcher deliver?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
