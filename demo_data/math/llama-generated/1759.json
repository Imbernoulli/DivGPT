        "To determine how many cheese balls are in a 35oz barrel, we first need to find out how many cheese balls are in the 24oz barrel and then use that information to find out how many cheese balls are in the 35oz barrel.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cheese balls in the 24oz barrel:\n   - The 24oz barrel has 60 servings.\n   - Each serving has 12 cheese balls.\n   - Therefore, the total number of cheese balls in the 24oz barrel is:\n     \\[\n     60 \\text{ servings} \\times 12 \\text{ cheese balls/serving} = 720 \\text{ cheese balls}\n     \\]\n\n2. Determine the number of cheese balls per ounce in the 24oz barrel:\n   - The 24oz barrel contains 720 cheese balls.\n   - Therefore, the number of cheese balls per ounce is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{720 \\text{ cheese balls}}{24 \\text{ oz}} = 30 \\text{ cheese balls/oz}\n     \\]\n\n3. Calculate the total number of cheese balls in the 35oz barrel:\n   - The 35oz barrel contains 35 ounces.\n   - Each ounce contains 30 cheese balls.\n   - Therefore, the total number of cheese balls in the 35oz barrel is:\n     \\[\n     35 \\text{ oz} \\times 30 \\text{ cheese balls/oz} = 1050 \\text{ cheese balls}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of cheese balls in a 35oz barrel is \\boxed{1050}.",
