        "To determine the total amount of money Miss Stevie paid Jerry, we need to calculate the total hours he worked and then multiply that by his hourly wage.\n\nFirst, let's find out how long Jerry took to fix the broken kitchen counter. According to the problem, it took him three times longer than the time he took painting the house. Since he took 8 hours painting the house, we can calculate the time it took to fix the kitchen counter as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\times 8 = 24 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add up all the hours Jerry worked. He worked on painting the house for 8 hours, fixing the kitchen counter for 24 hours, and mowing the lawn for 6 hours.
