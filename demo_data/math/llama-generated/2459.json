        "To determine how many tickets Taegan won from each game, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.\n\nLet's denote the number of tickets Taegan won from each game as \\( x \\). Since there are 5 games, the total number of tickets she won from the games is \\( 5x \\). Additionally, she found 5 tickets on the floor. Therefore, the total number of tickets she has is the sum of the tickets won from the games and the tickets found on the floor:\n\n\\[ 5x + 5 \\]\n\nEach ticket is worth $3, and the total value of all the tickets is $30. So, we can set up the following equation to represent the total value of the tickets:\n\n\\[ 3(5x + 5) = 30 \\]\n\nNext, we simplify and solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 15x + 15 = 30 \\]\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 15x = 15 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 15:\n\n\\[ x = 1 \\]\n\nSo, Taegan won \\(\\boxed{1}\\) ticket from each game.",

        "To determine how many tickets Taegan won from each game, we start by calculating the total number of tickets she has. Since each ticket is worth $3 and the total value of the tickets is $30, we can find the total number of tickets by dividing $30 by $3:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of tickets} = \\frac{30}{3} = 10\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Taegan found 5 tickets on the floor. Therefore, the number of tickets she won from the games is the total number of tickets minus the tickets she found:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Tickets won from games} = 10 - 5 = 5\n\\]\n\nSince Taegan played 5 carnival games and won an equal number of tickets from each game, we divide the total number of tickets won from the games by the number of games:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Tickets won per game} = \\frac{5}{5} = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, Taegan won \\(\\boxed{1}\\) ticket from each game."
