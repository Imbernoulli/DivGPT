        "To determine Julia's change, we first need to calculate the total cost of her purchase. Julia bought 2 pieces of Snickers and 3 packs of M&M's. The cost of each piece of Snickers is $1.5. Therefore, the cost of 2 pieces of Snickers is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 1.5 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the cost of one pack of M&M's. Since each pack of M&M's costs the same as 2 pieces of Snickers, the cost of one pack of M&M's is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 1.5 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of 3 packs of M&M's is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the Snickers and the cost of the M&M's to find the total cost of Julia's purchase:\n\\[ 3 + 9 = 12 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nJulia gave the cashier 2 $10 bills, which is a total of:\n\\[ 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTo find Julia's change, we subtract the total cost of her purchase from the amount she gave the cashier:\n\\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, Julia's change is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",
