        "To determine the total number of packs of crackers Nedy ate in the week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.\n\nFirst, we know that Nedy eats 8 packs of crackers from Monday to Thursday. This means that for each of these four days, he eats the same number of packs.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many packs Nedy eats on Friday. According to the problem, he eats twice the amount he eats on any of the other four days. Since he eats 8 packs each day from Monday to Thursday, he eats \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) packs on Friday.\n\nNow, we add up the total number of packs Nedy eats over the entire week. He eats 8 packs each day for 4 days, which is \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\) packs, and he eats 16 packs on Friday. Therefore, the total number of packs he eats in the week is \\(32 + 16 = 48\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{48}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of packs of crackers Nedy ate in the week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of packs eaten from Monday to Thursday:**\n   Nedy eats 8 packs of crackers each day from Monday to Thursday. Since there are 4 days in this period, we multiply the number of packs per day by the number of days:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ packs/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 32 \\text{ packs}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of packs eaten on Friday:**\n   Nedy eats twice the amount on Friday compared to each of the other days. Since she eats 8 packs each day from Monday to Thursday, on Friday she eats:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 8 \\text{ packs} = 16 \\text{ packs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of packs eaten in the entire week:**\n   To find the total number of packs eaten in the week, we add the number of packs eaten from Monday to Thursday to the number of packs eaten on Friday:\n   \\[\n   32 \\text{ packs} + 16 \\text{ packs} = 48 \\text{ packs}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of packs of crackers Nedy ate in all is \\(\\boxed{48}\\).",
