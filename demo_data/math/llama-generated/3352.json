        "To determine the total time James took to recover from his hand injury, we need to break down the recovery process into two distinct phases: the initial healing period before the skin graft and the healing period after the skin graft.\n\n1. **Initial Healing Period:**\n   James takes 4 weeks to heal enough to get a skin graft.\n\n2. **Healing Period After the Skin Graft:**\n   After the skin graft, it takes him 50% longer than the initial healing period to heal. First, we calculate 50% of the initial healing period:\n   \\[\n   50\\% \\text{ of 4 weeks} = 0.5 \\times 4 = 2 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total time to heal after the skin graft is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ weeks} + 2 \\text{ weeks} = 6 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Recovery Time:**\n   To find the total recovery time, we add the initial healing period and the healing period after the skin graft:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ weeks} + 6 \\text{ weeks} = 10 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total time James took to recover from everything is \\boxed{10} weeks.",

        "To determine the total time James took to recover from his hand injury, we need to break down the recovery process into two main parts: the time to heal enough to get a skin graft and the time to heal from the skin graft.\n\n1. **Time to heal enough to get a skin graft:**\n   James takes 4 weeks to heal enough to get a skin graft.\n\n2. **Time to heal from the skin graft:**\n   It takes him 50% longer than the time it took to heal enough to get the skin graft. First, we calculate 50% of 4 weeks:\n   \\[\n   0.50 \\times 4 = 2 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n   Adding this to the original 4 weeks, we get:\n   \\[\n   4 + 2 = 6 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n   So, it takes James 6 weeks to heal from the skin graft.\n\n3. **Total time to recover from everything:**\n   We add the time to heal enough to get the skin graft and the time to heal from the skin graft:\n   \\[\n   4 + 6 = 10 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time James took to recover from everything is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) weeks.",
        "To determine the total time James took to recover from everything, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate each part separately.\n\n1. **Time to heal from the initial accident:**\n   James takes 4 weeks to heal from the initial accident.\n\n2. **Time to heal from the skin graft:**\n   After the initial healing period, it takes him 50% longer to heal from the skin graft than it took to heal from the initial accident.\n   - First, calculate 50% of the initial healing time:\n     \\[\n     50\\% \\text{ of 4 weeks} = 0.5 \\times 4 = 2 \\text{ weeks}\n     \\]\n   - Add this to the initial healing time to find the total time for the skin graft healing:\n     \\[\n     4 weeks + 2 weeks = 6 weeks\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total recovery time:**\n   Add the time taken to heal from the initial accident to the time taken to heal from the skin graft:\n   \\[\n   4 weeks + 6 weeks = 10 weeks\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total time James took to recover from everything is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) weeks.",
