Determine how many chips are left after the first day.\n3. Calculate how many days it takes to eat the remaining chips, starting from the second day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of chips Marnie eats on the first day:\n\\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \\]\nSo, Marnie eats 10 chips on the first day.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of chips eaten on the first day from the total number of chips in the bag:\n\\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \\]\nSo, there are 90 chips left after the first day.\n\nStarting on the second day, Marnie eats 10 chips each day. To find out how many days it takes to eat the remaining 90 chips, we divide the number of remaining chips by the number of chips she eats each day:\n\\[ 90 \\div 10 = 9 \\]\nSo, it takes Marnie 9 days to eat the remaining 90 chips.\n\nSince Marnie starts eating on the second day, we add 1 (the first day) to the 9 days it takes to finish the remaining chips:\n\\[ 1 + 9 = 10 \\]\nSo, it takes Marnie a total of 10 days to eat the whole bag of chips.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",
        "To determine how many days it takes for Marnie to eat the whole bag of chips, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of chips Marnie eats on the first day:**\n   Marnie eats 5 chips to check if she likes them and then eats 5 more because she does.
