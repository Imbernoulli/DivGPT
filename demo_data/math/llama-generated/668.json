        "To determine the number of blue candles Avianna had, we start by understanding the given ratio of red candles to blue candles, which is 5:3. This means that for every 5 red candles, there are 3 blue candles. We are also given that Avianna had 45 red candles.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many sets of 5 red candles are in 45 red candles. We do this by dividing 45 by 5:\n\\[\n45 \\div 5 = 9\n\\]\nThis tells us that there are 9 sets of 5 red candles. Since the ratio of red candles to blue candles is 5:3, there must also be 9 sets of 3 blue candles. To find the total number of blue candles, we multiply 9 by 3:\n\\[\n9 \\times 3 = 27\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of blue candles Avianna had is \\boxed{27}.",
