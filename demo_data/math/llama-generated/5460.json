To find out how many cows are sold, we calculate one quarter of 56:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{56}{4} = 14\n   \\]\n   So, the farmer sells 14 cows.\n4. **Calculating the remaining cows**: To find out how many cows are left after selling 14 cows, we subtract 14 from 56:\n   \\[\n   56 - 14 = 42\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cows the farmer has left is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",
