        "To determine how much time Melinda and her family will save by driving 60 miles per hour instead of 50 miles per hour on their 1200-mile trip, we need to calculate the travel time for each speed and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the travel time at 50 miles per hour:\n\\[\n\\text{Travel time at 50 mph} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{1200 \\text{ miles}}{50 \\text{ mph}} = 24 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the travel time at 60 miles per hour:\n\\[\n\\text{Travel time at 60 mph} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{1200 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ mph}} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in travel times:\n\\[\n\\text{Time saved} = \\text{Travel time at 50 mph} - \\text{Travel time at 60 mph} = 24 \\text{ hours} - 20 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Melinda and her family will save \\boxed{4} hours by driving 60 miles per hour instead of 50 miles per hour.",
