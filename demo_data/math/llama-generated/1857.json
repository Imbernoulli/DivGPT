She is making three recipes that call for lower sodium soy sauce as a main ingredient. One bottle of lower sodium soy sauce holds 16 ounces. There are 8 ounces in 1 cup. The first recipe Stephanie is going to cook calls for 2 cups of lower sodium soy sauce. The second recipe calls for 1 cup. The third recipe calls for 3 cups. If Stephanie can only buy 1 whole bottle of soy sauce no matter how much she needs exactly, how many bottles of lower sodium soy sauce should Stephanie buy to allow for all three recipes?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
