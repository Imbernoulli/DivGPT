They donated 10 same-size cakes that she sliced into 8 slices per cake and started selling a slice for $1. A local business owner was so impressed by Didi's efforts that she offered to donate 50 cents for each slice Didi sold. A second business owner also offered to donate a quarter for each slice sold. If Didi sold all the slices, how much money did she raise?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
