        "Let's denote the total capacity of the water tank by \\( x \\) gallons. According to the problem, the tank is currently \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) full of water. Therefore, the amount of water currently in the tank is \\( \\frac{1}{3}x \\) gallons.\n\nWhen 16 gallons of water are added to the tank, it becomes full. This means that the amount of water currently in the tank plus the added water equals the total capacity of the tank. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}x + 16 = x\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we need to isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation. First, we subtract \\( \\frac{1}{3}x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n16 = x - \\frac{1}{3}x\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine the \\( x \\) terms on the right side. Since \\( x = \\frac{3}{3}x \\), we have:\n\\[\n16 = \\frac{3}{3}x - \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{2}{3}x\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so we get:\n\\[\nx = 16 \\div \\frac{2}{3} = 16 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total capacity of the water tank when full is \\(\\boxed{24}\\) gallons.",
        "Let's denote the total capacity of the water tank by \\( C \\) gallons. According to the problem, the tank is currently \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) full, so the amount of water currently in the tank is \\( \\frac{1}{3}C \\) gallons. When 16 gallons of water are added, the tank becomes full. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent this situation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}C + 16 = C\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( C \\), we first subtract \\( \\frac{1}{3}C \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n16 = C - \\frac{1}{3}C\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine the terms on the right side.
