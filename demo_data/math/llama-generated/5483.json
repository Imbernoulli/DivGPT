        "To determine what percentage of the fruit in the basket would be apples after Emily adds 5 more oranges, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of apples in the basket.\n2. Calculate the initial number of oranges in the basket.\n3. Determine the new number of oranges after Emily adds 5 more.\n4. Calculate the new total number of fruits in the basket.\n5. Find the percentage of the fruit that are apples.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The total number of apples in the basket is 10.\n\n2. The initial number of oranges in the basket is 5.\n\n3. After Emily adds 5 more oranges, the new number of oranges is:\n   \\[\n   5 + 5 = 10\n   \\]\n\n4. The new total number of fruits in the basket is the sum of the apples and the new number of oranges:\n   \\[\n   10 + 10 = 20\n   \\]\n\n5. To find the percentage of the fruit that are apples, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage of apples} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of apples}}{\\text{Total number of fruits}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage of apples} = \\left( \\frac{10}{20} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the fruit in the basket that would be apples is \\boxed{50}.",
        "To determine the percentage of apples in the basket after Emily adds 5 more oranges, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial number of fruits in the basket.\n2. Determine the new total number of fruits after adding the extra oranges.\n3. Calculate the percentage of apples in the new total.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial number of fruits in the basket. There are 10 apples and 5 oranges, so the initial total number of fruits is:\n\\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \\]\n\nNext, Emily adds 5 more oranges to the basket. The new total number of fruits is:\n\\[ 15 + 5 = 20 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage of the new total number of fruits are apples. Since there are still 10 apples, we use the formula for percentage:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of apples} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of apples}}{\\text{Total number of fruits}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of apples} = \\left( \\frac{10}{20} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.5 \\times 100 = 50\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the fruit in the basket that are apples is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",

Determine the new number of fruits after Emily adds more oranges.\n3. Calculate the number of apples as a fraction of the new total number of fruits.\n4. Convert the fraction to a percentage.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial number of fruits in the basket.**\n\nThe basket initially has 10 apples and 5 oranges. Therefore, the total number of fruits is:\n\\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the new number of fruits after Emily adds more oranges.**\n\nEmily adds 5 more oranges to the basket. The new number of oranges is:\n\\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \\]\nSo, the new total number of fruits is:\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of apples as a fraction of the new total number of fruits.**\n\nThe number of apples remains 10. The fraction of the fruits that are apples is:\n\\[ \\frac{10}{20} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Convert the fraction to a percentage.**\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{10}{20}\\) to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\\[ \\frac{10}{20} \\times 100 = 50\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the fruit in the basket that would be apples is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",

Therefore, the new number of oranges is:\n\\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \\]\n\nThe total number of fruits now is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ (apples)} + 10 \\text{ (oranges)} = 20 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out the number of apples, which remains the same.**\n\nThe number of apples remains 10.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the percentage of apples in the new total number of fruits.**\n\nThe percentage of apples is given by the ratio of the number of apples to the total number of fruits, multiplied by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{10}{20} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\% \\]\n\nSo, the percentage of the fruit in the basket that would be apples is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",
