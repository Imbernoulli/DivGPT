        "To determine Ruiz's new salary after a 6% raise, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of the raise.\n2. Add the raise to his original salary.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount of the raise.**\n\nRuiz's original salary is $500. A 6% raise means he will receive an additional 6% of $500.
