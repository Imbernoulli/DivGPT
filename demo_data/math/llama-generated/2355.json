        "To determine the total amount Marta spent on textbooks, we need to break down the cost of each type of book and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **Cost of textbooks bought on sale:**\n   Marta bought five textbooks on sale, each costing $10.\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost for the sale textbooks is $50.\n\n2. **Cost of textbooks ordered online:**\n   Marta ordered two textbooks online, which cost her a total of $40.\n   \\[\n   40\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost for the online textbooks is $40.\n\n3. **Cost of textbooks bought from the bookstore:**\n   Marta bought three textbooks directly from the bookstore, which cost her a total of three times the cost of the online ordered books. Since the total cost of the online ordered books is $40, the cost for the bookstore textbooks is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 40 = 120\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost for the bookstore textbooks is $120.\n\n4. **Total cost of all textbooks:**\n   To find the total amount Marta spent on textbooks, we add the costs of the sale textbooks, the online textbooks, and the bookstore textbooks:\n   \\[\n   50 + 40 + 120 = 210\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount Marta spent on textbooks is \\(\\boxed{210}\\).",
