Calculate the total number of jelly beans needed for all the small drinking glasses.\n4. Add the totals from steps 2 and 3 to get the overall total.\n\nFirst, we know that it takes 50 large jelly beans to fill up a large drinking glass. Since a small drinking glass takes half the amount of jelly beans as a large drinking glass, we calculate:\n\\[ 50 \\div 2 = 25 \\]\nSo, it takes 25 jelly beans to fill up a small drinking glass.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of jelly beans needed for all 5 large drinking glasses:\n\\[ 50 \\times 5 = 250 \\]\nSo, it takes 250 jelly beans to fill up all the large drinking glasses.\n\nThen, we calculate the total number of jelly beans needed for all 3 small drinking glasses:\n\\[ 25 \\times 3 = 75 \\]\nSo, it takes 75 jelly beans to fill up all the small drinking glasses.\n\nFinally, we add the totals from the large and small drinking glasses to get the overall total:\n\\[ 250 + 75 = 325 \\]\nSo, the total number of jelly beans needed to fill up all the drinking glasses is \\(\\boxed{325}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of jelly beans needed to fill up the glasses, we need to calculate the number of jelly beans required for each type of glass and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of jelly beans needed for one large drinking glass:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ jelly beans} \\]\n\nSince there are 5 large drinking glasses, the total number of jelly beans needed for the large glasses is:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ jelly beans/glass} \\times 5 \\text{ glasses} = 250 \\text{ jelly beans} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of jelly beans needed for one small drinking glass.
