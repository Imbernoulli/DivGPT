        "To determine how many of those who attended Simon's birthday party did not bring gifts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of boys who brought gifts.\n2. Calculate the number of girls who brought gifts.\n3. Determine the total number of people who brought gifts.\n4. Subtract the number of people who brought gifts from the total number of attendees.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of boys who brought gifts. There are 16 boys, and three-fourths of them brought gifts:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of boys who brought gifts} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 16 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of girls who brought gifts. There are 14 girls, and six-sevenths of them brought gifts:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls who brought gifts} = \\frac{6}{7} \\times 14 = 12\n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of people who brought gifts by adding the number of boys who brought gifts and the number of girls who brought gifts:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of people who brought gifts} = 12 + 12 = 24\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's subtract the number of people who brought gifts from the total number of attendees to find out how many did not bring gifts. There are 16 boys and 14 girls, so the total number of attendees is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of attendees} = 16 + 14 = 30\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Number of people who did not bring gifts} = 30 - 24 = 6\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of those who attended and did not bring gifts is \\boxed{6}.",
