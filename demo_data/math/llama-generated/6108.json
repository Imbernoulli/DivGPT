        "Let's first determine the number of pets each person has.\n\nTeddy has 7 dogs and 8 cats. So, the total number of pets Teddy has is:\n\\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \\]\n\nBen has 9 more dogs than Teddy. Since Teddy has 7 dogs, Ben has:\n\\[ 7 + 9 = 16 \\]\n dogs. Ben has no cats, so the total number of pets Ben has is:\n\\[ 16 \\]\n\nDave has 5 less dogs than Teddy and 13 more cats than Teddy. Since Teddy has 7 dogs, Dave has:\n\\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \\]\n dogs. Since Teddy has 8 cats, Dave has:\n\\[ 8 + 13 = 21 \\]\n cats. So, the total number of pets Dave has is:\n\\[ 2 + 21 = 23 \\]\n\nNow, we add up the total number of pets that Teddy, Ben, and Dave have:\n\\[ 15 + 16 + 23 = 54 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pets all of them have combined is:\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]",
