        "To determine how many books had been borrowed by lunchtime, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of books on the shelf**: 100 books.\n2. **Books borrowed by lunchtime**: Let this number be \\( x \\).\n3. **Books added to the shelf by lunchtime**: 40 books.\n4. **Books borrowed by evening**: 30 books.\n5. **Books remaining by evening**: 60 books.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of books on the shelf after lunchtime. Initially, there are 100 books. After \\( x \\) books are borrowed, there are \\( 100 - x \\) books left. Then, 40 more books are added, so the number of books on the shelf becomes \\( 100 - x + 40 = 140 - x \\).\n\nNext, we know that by evening, 30 more books are borrowed. Therefore, the number of books remaining by evening is \\( 140 - x - 30 = 110 - x \\).\n\nWe are given that the shelf has 60 books remaining by the evening. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 110 - x = 60 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ 110 - x = 60 \\]\n\\[ 110 - 60 = x \\]\n\\[ x = 50 \\]\n\nThus, the number of books borrowed by lunchtime is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
        "Let's denote the number of books borrowed by lunchtime as \\( x \\). Initially, Hadley arranges 100 books on the shelf. By lunchtime, \\( x \\) books are borrowed, so the number of books left on the shelf is \\( 100 - x \\). Then, she adds 40 more books to the shelf, so the number of books on the shelf becomes \\( 100 - x + 40 = 140 - x \\).\n\nBy evening, 30 more books are borrowed, so the number of books left on the shelf is \\( 140 - x - 30 = 110 - x \\). According to the problem, by evening there are 60 books remaining on the shelf. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 110 - x = 60 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 60 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 110 - 60 = x \\]\n\\[ x = 50 \\]\n\nSo, the number of books borrowed by lunchtime is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",

        "To determine how many books had been borrowed by lunchtime, we need to follow the sequence of events and use the information given to set up an equation.\n\n1.
