To raise $610 to pay for her next shipment of wares, she splits the profit in half and solicits donations from her family and friends.

        "First, we need to determine half of the trader's profit. The trader's profit for the week is $960. So, we calculate half of $960 as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{960}{2} = 480\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the donations the trader received to this half of her profit. The total donations received are $310. Therefore, we add $310 to $480:\n\n\\[\n480 + 310 = 790\n\\]\n\nThe trader's goal is to raise $610. To find out how much money she made above her goal, we subtract the goal from the total amount of money she has:\n\n\\[\n790 - 610 = 180\n\\]\n\nThus, the trader made \\(\\boxed{180}\\) dollars above her goal.",
