        "To determine the total amount Donna paid for the porcelain vase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the sale price of the vase after the 25% discount.\n2.

To find the sales tax, we multiply the sale price by 10%.\n\nThe sales tax amount is:\n\\[ 150 \\times \\frac{10}{100} = 150 \\times 0.10 = 15 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the sales tax to the sale price to get the total amount paid.**\n\nThe total amount paid is:\n\\[ 150 + 15 = 165 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Donna paid is:\n\\[ \\boxed{165} \\]",

The discount amount is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Discount amount} = 200 \\times \\frac{25}{100} = 200 \\times 0.25 = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the sale price:\n\\[ \\text{Sale price} = 200 - 50 = 150 \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the sales tax on the sale price. The sales tax rate is 10%. The sales tax amount is:\n\\[ \\text{Sales tax} = 150 \\times \\frac{10}{100} = 150 \\times 0.10 = 15 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the sales tax to the sale price to get the total amount paid:\n\\[ \\text{Total amount paid} = 150 + 15 = 165 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Donna paid is:\n\\[ \\boxed{165} \\]",
