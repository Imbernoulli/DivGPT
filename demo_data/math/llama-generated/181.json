He has 10 machines and they take 30 ball bearings each.  It normally costs $1 per ball bearing but right now there is a sale where they are only $.75.  Also since he is buying in bulk he gets a further 20% discount.  How much money did he save by buying them all during the sale rather than 1 at a time?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

First, we calculate the cost before the additional discount:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ ball bearings} \\times \\$0.75 \\text{ per ball bearing} = \\$225 \\]\n\nThen, we apply the 20% discount:\n\\[ \\$225 \\times (1 - 0.20) = \\$225 \\times 0.80 = \\$180 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the amount of money John saved by buying the ball bearings during the sale rather than at the regular price:\n\\[ \\$300 - \\$180 = \\$120 \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money John saved is:\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]",
