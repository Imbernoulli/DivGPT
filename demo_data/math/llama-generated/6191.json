According to the problem, the total value of the nickels and dimes combined is 70 cents. This gives us the following equation:\n\n\\[ 5n + 10(n + 4) = 70 \\]\n\nNext, we simplify and solve the equation step by step.\n\nFirst, distribute the 10 through the parentheses:\n\n\\[ 5n + 10n + 40 = 70 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 15n + 40 = 70 \\]\n\nSubtract 40 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 15n = 30 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 15:\n\n\\[ n = 2 \\]\n\nSo, Steve is holding \\(\\boxed{2}\\) nickels.",
        "To determine how many nickels Steve is holding, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( n \\) as the number of nickels.\n- \\( d \\) as the number of dimes.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1.
