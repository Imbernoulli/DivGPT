She spends 2 hours a week on chess club, 8 hours a week on drama club, and 3 hours a week on glee club. So, the total number of hours she spends on extracurriculars each week is:\n\n\\[ 2 + 8 + 3 = 13 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nSince she spends 4 weeks on extracurriculars, the total number of hours she spends on extracurriculars before midterms is:\n\n\\[ 13 \\times 4 = 52 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hours of extracurriculars Annie does before midterms is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{52}\n\\]",
