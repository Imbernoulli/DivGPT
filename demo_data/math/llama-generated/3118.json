She has run out of packing peanuts for the packages and is now wondering how many orders she has sent. Each large order needs 200g of packing peanuts while small orders need just 50g of packing peanuts. If Lisa has used a total of 800g of packing peanuts and she knows she has sent 3 large orders, how many small orders has Lisa sent?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the number of small orders Vanessa has sent, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of packing peanuts used for large orders:**\n   - Vanessa sends 3 large orders.\n   - Each large order requires 200g of packing peanuts.\n   - Total packing peanuts for large orders = \\( 3 \\times 200 \\) g = 600 g.\n\n2. **Calculate the remaining amount of packing peanuts used for small orders:**\n   - Vanessa has used a total of 800g of packing peanuts.\n   - Packing peanuts used for large orders = 600 g.\n   - Remaining packing peanuts for small orders = \\( 800 \\) g - \\( 600 \\) g = 200 g.\n\n3. **Determine the number of small orders:**\n   - Each small order requires 50g of packing peanuts.\n   - Number of small orders = \\( \\frac{200}F 50 \\) = 4.\n\nTherefore, Vanessa has sent \\(\\boxed{4}\\) small orders.",

Subtract the amount used for the large orders from the total amount of packing peanuts used.\n3. Determine how many small orders were sent based on the remaining amount of packing peanuts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of packing peanuts used for the large orders. Vanessa sent 3 large orders, and each large order requires 200g of packing peanuts:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ large orders} \\times 200 \\text{ g/order} = 600 \\text{ g}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount used for the large orders from the total amount of packing peanuts used:\n\\[\n800 \\text{ g} - 600 \\text{ g} = 200 \\text{ g}\n\\]\n\nSince each small order requires 50g of packing peanuts, we can determine the number of small orders by dividing the remaining amount of packing peanuts by the amount needed per small order:\n\\[\n200 \\text{ g} \\div 50 \\text{ g/order} = 4 \\text{ small orders}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of small orders Vanessa has sent is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
