        "To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of throwfish and blowfish:**\n   Since the aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish, and the total number of fish is 100, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of clownfish} + \\text{Number of blowfish} = 100\n   \\]\n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of clownfish. Therefore, \\( x \\) is also the number of blowfish. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   x + x = 100\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we find:\n   \\[\n   2x = 100 \\implies x = 50\n   \\]\n   So, there are 50 clownfish and 50 blowfish.\n\n2. **Determine the number of blowfish in the display tank:**\n   We know that 26 blowfish stay in their own tank. Therefore, the number of blowfish in the display tank is:\n   \\[\n   50 - 26 = 24\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of clownfish initially in the display tank:**\n   An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, which is 24 clownfish.\n\n4. **Determine the number of clownfish that swim back to their own tank:**\n   A third of the clownfish in the display tank swim back to their own tank. Therefore, the number of clownfish that swim back is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24}{3} = 8\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the number of clownfish remaining in the display tank:**\n   The number of clownfish remaining in the display tank after some swim back is:\n   \\[\n   24 - 8 = 16\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of clownfish now in the display tank is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
        "Let's denote the number of clownfish and blowfish each as \\( x \\).
