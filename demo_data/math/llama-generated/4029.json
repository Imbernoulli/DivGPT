        "To determine how many students don't have a favorite subject, we start by calculating the number of students who like Math, English, and Science.\n\nFirst, we find the number of students who like Math:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times 30 = 6\n\\]\nSo, 6 students like Math.\n\nNext, we find the number of students who like English:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 30 = 10\n\\]\nSo, 10 students like English.\n\nAfter accounting for the students who like Math and English, we calculate the remaining number of students:\n\\[\n30 - 6 - 10 = 14\n\\]\nNow, we find the number of students who like Science. According to the problem, 1/7 of the remaining students like Science:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{7} \\times 14 = 2\n\\]\nSo, 2 students like Science.\n\nFinally, we determine the number of students who don't have a favorite subject by subtracting the number of students who like Math, English, and Science from the total number of students:\n\\[\n30 - 6 - 10 - 2 = 12\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of students who don't have a favorite subject is \\boxed{12}.",
