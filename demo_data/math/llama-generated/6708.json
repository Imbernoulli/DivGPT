        "To determine the total number of hours John worked, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the days John worked.\n2. Calculate the number of days he worked.\n3. Multiply the number of days by the number of hours he worked each day.\n\nFirst, let's identify the days John worked. He worked from the 3rd to the 8th, including the 3rd and not including the 8th. This means he worked on the following days: 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th.\n\nNext, we count the number of days he worked. From the list above, we can see that he worked for 5 days.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of days by the number of hours he worked each day. John worked 8 hours each day, so we have:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ days} \\times 8 \\text{ hours/day} = 40 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours John worked is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of hours John worked, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the days John worked.\n2. Calculate the number of days he worked.\n3. Multiply the number of days by the number of hours he worked each day.\n\nFirst, let's identify the days John worked. He worked from the 3rd to the 8th, including the 3rd and not including the 8th. This means he worked on the following days:\n- 3rd\n- 4th\n- 5th\n- 6th\n- 7th\n\nNext, we count the number of days he worked. From the list above, we can see that there are 5 days.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of days by the number of hours he worked each day. John worked 8 hours each day, so:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ days} \\times 8 \\text{ hours/day} = 40 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours John worked is \\(\\boxed{40}\\)."
