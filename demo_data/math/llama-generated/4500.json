        "To determine how many hours it took Stella and Twinkle to fill the truck, we need to break the problem into two parts: the time they worked alone and the time they worked with the additional people.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many stone blocks Stella and Twinkle fill in the first four hours. Since each person works at a rate of 250 blocks per hour, and there are two people working, the combined rate is:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ blocks/hour/person} \\times 2 \\text{ people} = 500 \\text{ blocks/hour} \\]\n\n over four hours, they fill:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ blocks/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 2000 \\text{ blocks} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many stone blocks are left to be filled after the first four hours. The truck has a capacity of 6000 blocks, so:\n\\[ 6000 \\text{ blocks} - 2000 \\text{ blocks} = 4000 \\text{ blocks} \\]\n\nAfter the first four hours, Stella and Twinkle are joined by 6 other people, making a total of 8 people working. The combined rate for 8 people is:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ blocks/hour/person} \\times 8 \\text{ people} = 2000 \\text{ blocks/hour} \\]\n\nTo find out how many hours it takes for the 8 people to fill the remaining 4000 blocks, we divide the number of blocks left by their combined rate:\n\\[ 4000 \\text{ blocks} \\div 2000 \\text{ blocks/hour} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it took to fill the truck is the sum of the time they worked alone and the time they worked with the additional people:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",
