        "To determine how many minutes it took Andy to put away the laundry, we start by identifying the relationship between the time it took Andy and the time it took Dawn. According to the problem, Andy took six minutes more than two times the number of minutes it took Dawn to wash the dishes.\n\nLet's denote the time it took Dawn to wash the dishes as \\( D \\). We are given that \\( D = 20 \\) minutes.\n\nNext, we express the time it took Andy to put away the laundry in terms of \\( D \\). The problem states that Andy took six minutes more than two times the number of minutes it took Dawn. This can be written as:\n\\[\nA = 2D + 6\n\\]\nwhere \\( A \\) is the time it took Andy to put away the laundry.\n\nSubstituting the given value of \\( D \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[\nA = 2(20) + 6\n\\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 2 \\times 20 \\):\n\\[\n2 \\times 20 = 40\n\\]\n\nThen, we add 6 to 40:\n\\[\n40 + 6 = 46\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it took Andy \\(\\boxed{46}\\) minutes to put away the laundry.",
