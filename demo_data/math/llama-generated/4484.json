        "To determine how many more seed packets Carter needs to grow a total of 12 plants in his backyard, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of plants per seed packet:**\n   Carter grew 9 plants with 3 seed packets. To find out how many plants each seed packet can grow, we divide the total number of plants by the number of seed packets:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Plants per seed packet} = \\frac{9 \\text{ plants}}{3 \\text{ seed packets}} = 3 \\text{ plants per seed packet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of seed packets needed for 12 plants:**\n   Since each seed packet grows 3 plants, we need to find out how many seed packets are required to grow 12 plants. We do this by dividing the total number of plants by the number of plants per seed packet:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Seed packets needed} = \\frac{12 \\text{ plants}}{3 \\text{ plants per seed packet}} = 4 \\text{ seed packets}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many more seed packets Carter needs:**\n   Carter already has 3 seed packets. To find out how many more seed packets he needs, we subtract the number of seed packets he has from the total number of seed packets needed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{׆_dc seed packets needed} = 4 \\text{ seed packets} - 3 \\text{ seed packets} = 1 \\text{ seed packet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Carter needs \\boxed{1} more seed packet to have a total of 12 plants in his backyard.",

        "To determine how many more seed packets Carter needs to have a total of 12 plants in his backyard, we start by finding out how many seed packets are needed for one plant. We know that Carter grew 9 plants with 3 seed packets. Therefore, the number of seed packets needed for one plant is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\text{ seed packets}}{9 \\text{ plants}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ seed packet}}{3 \\text{ plants}}\n\\]\n\nThis means that each plant requires \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of a seed packet. To find out how many seed packets are needed for 12 plants, we multiply the number of plants by the number of seed packets required per plant:\n\n\\[\n12 \\text{ plants} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ seed packet}}{3 \\text{ plants}} = 4 \\text{ seed packets}\n\\]\n\nCarter already has 3 seed packets. To find out how many more seed packets he needs, we subtract the number of seed packets he already has from the total number of seed packets needed:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ seed packets} - 3 \\text{ seed packets} = 1 \\text{ seed packet}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Carter needs \\(\\boxed{1}\\) more seed packet to have a total of 12 plants in his backyard.",
        "To determine how many more seed packets Carter needs to have a total of 12 plants in his backyard, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of plants per seed packet:**\n   Carter grew 9 plants with 3 seed packets. Therefore, the number of plants per seed packet is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9 \\text{ plants}}{3 \\text{ seed packets}} = 3 \\text{ plants per seed packet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of seed packets needed for 12 plants:**\n   Since each seed packet covers 3 plants, we need to find out how many seed packets are required for 12 plants. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of plants by the number of plants per seed packet:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12 \\text{ plants}}{3 \\text{ plants per seed packet}} = 4 \\text{ seed packets}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of additional seed packets needed:**\n   Carter already has 3 seed packets. To find out how many more seed packets he needs, we subtract the number of seed packets he already has from the total number of seed packets required:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ seed packets} - 3 \\text{ seed packets} = 1 \\text{ seed packet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Carter needs \\boxed{1} more seed packet to have a total of 12 plants in his backyard.",
