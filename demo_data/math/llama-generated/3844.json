        "First, let's determine the total number of shells Ed found. Ed found 7 limpet shells, 2 oyster shells, and 4 conch shells. We add these together:\n\n\\[ 7 + 2 + 4 = 13 \\]\n\nSo, Ed found 13 shells. Since Jacob found 2 more shells than Ed did, we add 2 to the number of shells Ed found:\n\n\\[ 13 + 2 = 15 \\]\n\nSo, Jacob found 15 shells.

Determine how many shells Jacob found.\n3. Add the shells Ed found, the shells Jacob found, and the initial number of shells they had in their collection.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of shells Ed found. Ed found 7 limpet shells, 2 oyster shells, and 4 conch shells. So, we add these together:\n\\[ 7 + 2 + 4 = 13 \\]\nTherefore, Ed found 13 shells.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many shells Jacob found. Jacob found 2 more shells than Ed did. Since Ed found 13 shells, Jacob found:\n\\[ 13 + 2 = 15 \\]\nTherefore, Jacob found 15 shells.\n\nNow, we add the shells Ed found, the shells Jacob found, and the initial number of shells they had in their collection. They initially had 2 shells in their collection. So, we add:\n\\[ 2 + 13 + 15 = 30 \\]\nTherefore, the total number of shells Ed and Jacob have altogether is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",
