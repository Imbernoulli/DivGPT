For toppings, he has 3 cheese, 4 meat and 5 vegetable options, one of which is peppers. He can have only one selection from each topping category (one cheese, one meat and one vegetable).

        "To determine the total number of topping combinations Denmark can have, we need to consider the constraints given in the problem. Denmark can choose one cheese, one meat, and one vegetable from the available options. However, if he chooses pepperoni (which is one of the meat options), he cannot choose peppers (which is one of the vegetable options).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of combinations without any restrictions. Denmark has 3 choices for cheese, 4 choices for meat, and 5 choices for vegetables. Therefore, the total number of combinations is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of restricted combinations where Denmark chooses pepperoni and peppers. If Denmark chooses pepperoni, he has only 1 choice for meat (pepperoni), 3 choices for cheese, and 1 choice for vegetables (peppers). Therefore, the number of restricted combinations is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 3 \\]\n\nTo find the total number of valid combinations, we subtract the number of restricted combinations from the total number of combinations:\n\\[ 60 - 3 = 57 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of topping combinations Denmark has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{57} \\]",
