        "To determine the total cost of all the art John collected, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of each of the first 3 pieces of art.\n2. Determine the cost of the fourth piece of art.\n3. Sum the costs of all 4 pieces of art.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of each of the first 3 pieces of art. Since John pays the same price for each of the first 3 pieces and the total cost for these 3 pieces is $45,000, we can divide $45,000 by 3:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of each of the first 3 pieces} = \\frac{45000}{3} = 15000\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the cost of the fourth piece of art. The fourth piece is 50% more expensive than each of the first 3 pieces. Therefore, we calculate 50% of $15,000 and add it to the original price of $15,000:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of the fourth piece} = 15000 + 0.5 \\times 15000 = 15000 + 7500 = 22500\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the costs of all 4 pieces of art:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 15000 + 15000 + 15000 + 22500 = 67500\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost of all the art is \\boxed{67500}.",
