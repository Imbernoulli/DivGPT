        "To determine how much money Kyle will make from selling all of his baked goods, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cookies left after Kyle and his mom eat some.\n2. Calculate the number of brownies left after Kyle and his mom eat some.\n3. Determine the total revenue from selling the remaining cookies and brownies.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of cookies left:\n- Kyle starts with 60 cookies.\n- Kyle eats 2 cookies.\n- Kyle's mom eats 1 cookie.\n- Total cookies eaten = 2 + 1 = 3.\n- Cookies left = 60 - 3 = 57.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of brownies left:\n- Kyle starts with 32 brownies.\n- Kyle eats 2 brownies.\n- Kyle's mom eats 2 brownies.\n- Total brownies eaten = 2 + 2 = 4.\n- Brownies left = 32 - 4 = 28.\n\nNow, let's determine the total revenue from selling the remaining cookies and brownies:\n- Each cookie sells for $1.\n- Each brownie sells for $1.50.\n- Revenue from cookies = 57 * $1 = $57.\n- Revenue from brownies = 28 * $1.50 = $42.\n- Total revenue = $57 + $42 = $99.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Kyle will make if he sells all of his baked goods is \\(\\boxed{99}\\).",
