        "To determine how long it would take Amanda to run the length of a 10000-meter track at the same speed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Amanda's running speed.\n2. Use her speed to find out how long it takes her to run 10000 meters.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Amanda's running speed. She runs 2000 meters in 2 hours. Therefore, her speed is:\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ meters}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 1000 \\text{ meters per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes her to run 10000 meters at this speed. Using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{10000 \\text{ meters}}{1000 \\text{ meters per hour}} = 10 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSo, it would take Amanda \\boxed{10} hours to run the length of a 10000-meter track at the same speed.",
        "To determine how long it would take Amanda to run the length of a 10000-meter track at the same speed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find Amanda's speed in meters per hour:**\n\n   Amanda runs 2000 meters in 2 hours. Therefore, her speed \\( v \\) is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   v = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ meters}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 1000 \\text{ meters per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the time to run 10000 meters:**\n\n   Now that we know Amanda's speed, we can use it to find out how long it takes her to run 10000 meters. Let \\( t \\) be the time it takes her to run 10000 meters. Using the formula \\( \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{10000 \\text{ meters}}{1000 \\text{ meters per hour}} = 10 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it would take Amanda \\(\\boxed{10}\\) hours to run the length of a 10000-meter track at the same speed.",
        "To determine how long it would take Amanda to run the length of a 10000-meter track at the same speed, we need to first calculate her running speed in meters per hour. We know that Amanda can run 2000 meters in 2 hours. Therefore, her speed is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ meters}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 1000 \\text{ meters per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take her to run 10000 meters at this speed. Using the formula for time, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n\\]\n\nwe substitute the distance (10000 meters) and the speed (1000 meters per hour):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{10000 \\text{ meters}}{1000 \\text{ meters per hour}} = 10 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, it would take Amanda \\boxed{10} hours to run the length of a 10000-meter track at the same speed."
