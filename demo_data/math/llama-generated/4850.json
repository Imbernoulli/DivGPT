        "To determine John's profit from driving Uber, we need to account for both his earnings from Uber and the depreciation of his car.\n\n1. First, we note John's earnings from Uber, which is $30,000.\n2. Next, we calculate the depreciation of the car. The car was originally bought for $18,000 and was traded in for $6,000. Therefore, the depreciation is:\n   \\[\n   18,000 - 6,000 = 12,000\n   \\]\n3.
