Multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of cereal for one week:\n- Travis goes through 2 boxes of cereal each week.\n- Each box costs $3.00.\n- Therefore, the cost for one week is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ boxes/week} \\times \\$3.00/\\text{box} = \\$6.00/\\text{week}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year:\n- There are 52 weeks in a year.\n- The weekly cost is $6.00.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the year is:\n  \\[\n  52 \\text{ weeks/year} \\times \\$6.00/\\text{week} = \\$312.00\n  \\]\n\nThus, Travis spends \\(\\boxed{312}\\) dollars on cereal in a year.",
