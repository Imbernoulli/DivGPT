        "To determine how much less money Jenna has in her account than Bob, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find out how much money Phil has:**\n   Phil has one-third the amount of money that Bob has.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Phil's money} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Bob's money} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find out how much money Jenna has:**\n   Jenna has twice as much money as Phil.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jenna's money} = 2 \\times \\text{Phil's money} = 2 \\times 20 = 40\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how much less money Jenna has than Bob:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{Bob's money} - \\text{Jenna's money} = 60 - 40 = 20\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jenna has \\(\\boxed{20}\\) dollars less in her account than Bob.",
        "Let's start by determining how much money Phil has. According to the problem, Phil has one-third the amount of money that Bob has in his account. Since Bob has $60, we calculate Phil's amount as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Phil's money} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Jenna has. The problem states that Jenna has twice as much money in her bank account as Phil does. Since Phil has $20, we calculate Jenna's amount as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Jenna's money} = 2 \\times 20 = 40\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how much less money Jenna has in her account than Bob. We do this by subtracting Jenna's amount from Bob's amount:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 60 - 40 = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, Jenna has \\(\\boxed{20}\\) dollars less in her account than Bob.",
