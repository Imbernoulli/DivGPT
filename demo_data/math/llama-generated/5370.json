Since there are 66 goats, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Number of chickens} = 2 \\times 66 = 132 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of goats and chickens:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of goats and chickens} = 66 + 132 = 198 \\]\n\nThe problem states that the number of ducks is half of the total number of goats and chickens. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Number of ducks} = \\frac{198}{2} = 99 \\]\n\nThe problem also states that the number of pigs is a third of the number of ducks. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Number of pigs} = \\frac{99}{3} = 33 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of goats and pigs:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 66 - 33 = 33 \\]\n\nSo, there are \\(\\boxed{33}\\) more goats than pigs.",
