Divide the new annual salary by the number of kids to find out how much each parent has to pay.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the teacher's new annual salary after the raise.**\n\nThe teacher's original salary is $45,000 per year. They offered him a 20% raise. First, we calculate 20% of the original salary:\n\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } 45,000 = 0.20 \\times 45,000 = 9,000 \\]\n\nNext, we add this raise to the original salary to find the new salary:\n\n\\[ 45,000 + 9,000 = 54,000 \\]\n\nSo, the teacher's new annual salary is $54,000.\n\n**Step 2: Divide the new annual salary by the number of kids to find out how much each parent has to pay.**\n\nThere are 9 kids, so we divide the new salary by 9:\n\n\\[ \\frac{54,000}{9} = 6,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, each parent has to pay \\(\\boxed{6000}\\).",
        "To determine how much each parent has to pay, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the raise amount:**\n   The teacher's former salary was $45,000 per year, and they offered him a 20% raise.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Raise amount} = 45,000 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 45,000 \\times 0.20 = 9,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the new salary:**\n   Add the raise amount to the former salary to find the new salary.\n   \\[\n   \\text{New salary} = 45,000 + 9,000 = 54,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the cost per parent:**\n   There are 9 kids, so the new salary of $54,000 needs to be divided equally among the 9 parents.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per parent} = \\frac{54,000}{9} = 6,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each parent has to pay \\(\\boxed{6000}\\).",
        "To determine how much each parent has to pay, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the new salary of the teacher after the raise.\n2. Divide the new salary by the number of kids.\n\nFirst, we calculate the new salary. The teacher's former salary was $45,000, and they offered him a 20% raise. To find out the amount of the raise, we multiply $45,000 by 20% (which is equivalent to 0.20):\n\n\\[ 45,000 \\times 0.20 = 9,000 \\]\n\nSo, the raise is $9,000. We add this raise to the teacher's former salary to get the new salary:\n\n\\[ 45,000 + 9,000 = 54,000 \\]\n\nNow, we need to divide the new salary by the number of kids to find out how much each parent has to pay.
