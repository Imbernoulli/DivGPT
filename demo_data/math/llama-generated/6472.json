        "To determine how much Jade saves per month, we need to calculate how much she spends on living expenses and insurance, and then subtract these amounts from her total monthly earnings.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount Jade spends on living expenses. She spends 75% of her monthly earnings on living expenses:\n\\[\n0.75 \\times 1600 = 1200\n\\]\nSo, Jade spends $1200 on living expenses.\n\nNext, we calculate the amount Jade spends on insurance. She spends one-fifth of her monthly earnings on insurance:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times 1600 = 320\n\\]\nSo, Jade spends $320 on insurance.\n\nNow, we add the amounts spent on living expenses and insurance to find the total amount spent:\n\\[\n1200 + 320 = 1520\n\\]\nSo, Jade spends $1520 on living expenses and insurance combined.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount spent from her total monthly earnings to find out how much she saves:\n\\[\n1600 - 1520 = 80\n\\]\nSo, Jade saves \\(\\boxed{80}\\) dollars per month.",
