According to the problem, in 2 years the number of words he knows has increased by 50%. Therefore, the new number of words he knows is:\n\\[ x + 7300 \\]\n\nThis new number of words is also equal to 150% of the original number of words, which can be expressed as:\n\\[ 1.5x \\]\n\nWe can set up the following equation:\n\\[ x + 7300 = 1.5x \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve the equation.**\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), subtract \\( x \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 7300 = 0.5x \\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 0.5:\n\\[ x = \\frac{7300}{0.5} = 14600 \\]\n\nSo, the original number of words Tim knew is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14600} \\]",
