        "To determine Will's net calorie intake after jogging, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total calories burned by Will during jogging.\n2. Subtract the calories burned from the calories consumed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total calories burned by Will during jogging. Will jog for half an hour, which is 30 minutes. He burns 10 calories per minute. Therefore, the total calories burned is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes} \\times 10 \\text{ calories/minute} = 300 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the calories burned from the calories consumed. Will consumed 900 calories from his breakfast. Therefore, his net calorie intake is:\n\\[ 900 \\text{ calories} - 300 \\text{ calories} = 600 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nSo, Will's net calorie intake after jogging is \\(\\boxed{600}\\).",
        "To determine Will's net calorie intake after jogging, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total calories burned during jogging:**\n   - Will jog for half an hour.\n   - Half an hour is equal to 30 minutes.\n   - He burns 10 calories per minute.\n   - Total calories burned = \\( 30 \\text{ minutes} \\times 10 \\text{ calories/minute} = 300 \\text{ calories} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the net calorie intake:**\n   - Will consumes 900 calories from his breakfast.\n   - He burns 300 calories from jogging.\n   - Net calorie intake = \\( 900 \\text{ calories} - 300 \\text{ calories} = 600 \\text{ calories} \\).\n\nTherefore, Will's net calorie intake after jogging is \\(\\boxed{600}\\).",

Calculate the total calories burned during jogging.\n3. Subtract the calories burned from the initial calorie intake.\n\nFirst, we know that Will's breakfast supplied him with 900 calories of energy. This is his initial calorie intake.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total calories burned during jogging. Will jogged for half an hour, which is 30 minutes. He burned 10 calories per minute. Therefore, the total calories burned is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes} \\times 10 \\text{ calories/minute} = 300 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the calories burned from the initial calorie intake to find the net calorie intake:\n\\[ 900 \\text{ calories} - 300 \\text{ calories} = 600 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nThus, Will's net calorie intake after jogging is \\(\\boxed{600}\\).",
        "To determine Will's net calorie intake after jogging, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total calories burned during jogging:**\n   - Will jog for 30 minutes.\n   - He uses up 10 calories per minute.\n   - Total calories burned = \\( 30 \\text{ minutes} \\times 10 \\text{ calories/minute} = 300 \\text{ calories} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Will's net calorie intake:**\n   - Will consumes 900 calories from breakfast.\n   - He burns 300 calories from jogging.\n   - Net calorie intake = \\( 900 \\text{ calories} - 300 \\text{ calories} = 600 \\text{ calories} \\).\n\nTherefore, Will's net calorie intake after jogging is \\(\\boxed{600}\\)."
