        "To determine how many pounds Kyle can lift in all, we need to find out how much he could lift last year and then add the increase to that amount.\n\nLet's denote the amount of weight Kyle could lift last year as \\( x \\) pounds. According to the problem, Kyle can lift 60 more pounds this year, which is 3 times as much as he could lift last year. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n\\[ 60 = 3x \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 3:\n\\[ x = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\]\n\nSo, Kyle could lift 20 pounds last year. Since he can lift 60 more pounds this year, the total weight he can lift now is:\n\\[ x + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight Kyle can lift in all is \\(\\boxed{80}\\) pounds.",

According to the problem:\n   \\[\n   3x = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   To find \\( x \\), divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, Kyle could lift 20 pounds last year.\n\n4. **Calculate this year's lifting capacity:**\n   Kyle can lift 60 more pounds this year than last year. Therefore, his lifting capacity this year is:\n   \\[\n   x + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80\n   \\]\n\nThus, Kyle can lift \\(\\boxed{80}\\) pounds this year.",
        "To determine how many pounds Kyle can lift in all, we need to find out how much he could lift last year and then add the increase to that amount.\n\n1. Let's denote the amount of weight Kyle could lift last year as \\( x \\) pounds.\n2. According to the problem, Kyle can lift 60 more pounds this year than last year, and this increase is 3 times the amount he could lift last year. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   60 = 3x\n   \\]\n3. To find \\( x \\), we need to solve the equation by dividing both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, Kyle could lift 20 pounds last year.\n4. Since Kyle can lift 60 more pounds this year than last year, the total weight he can lift this year is:\n   \\[\n   x + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80\n   \\]\n5. Therefore, the total weight Kyle can lift in all is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{80}\n   \\]",
