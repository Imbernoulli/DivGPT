Solve the equation for the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The initial number of rabbits in the cage is 13. When seven more rabbits are added, the total number of rabbits in the cage becomes:\n\\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we know that this total number of rabbits (20) is equal to one-third of the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park. Let's denote the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park by \\( x \\). According to the problem, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 20 = \\frac{1}{3} x \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we need to eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ 20 \\times 3 = x \\]\n\\[ 60 = x \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
