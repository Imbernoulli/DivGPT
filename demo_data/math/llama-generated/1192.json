        "To determine the total number of beds at Palm Meadows, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of rooms with two beds and the number of rooms with three beds.\n2. Calculate the total number of beds in the rooms with two beds.\n3. Calculate the total number of beds in the rooms with three beds.\n4. Add the two totals together to get the overall number of beds.\n\nLet's start with the first step. We know that there are 13 hotel rooms in total, and 8 of them have two beds. Therefore, the number of rooms with three beds is:\n\\[ 13 - 8 = 5 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of beds in the rooms with two beds. Since each of these 8 rooms has 2 beds, the total number of beds in these rooms is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total number of beds in the rooms with three beds. Since each of these 5 rooms has 3 beds, the total number of beds in these rooms is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the two totals together to get the overall number of beds:\n\\[ 16 + 15 = 31 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of beds at Palm Meadows is \\(\\boxed{31}\\).",

Therefore, the number of rooms with three beds is:\n\\[ 13 - 8 = 5 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of beds in the rooms with two beds. Since there are eight rooms with two beds each, the total number of beds in these rooms is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total number of beds in the rooms with three beds. Since there are five rooms with three beds each, the total number of beds in these rooms is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the two totals together to get the overall number of beds:\n\\[ 16 + 15 = 31 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of beds at Palm Meadows is:\n\\[ \\boxed{31} \\]",

Calculate the total number of beds in the rooms with three beds.\n   - Each of the 5 rooms has 3 beds.\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 3 = 15\n   \\]\n   Therefore, there are 15 beds in the rooms with three beds.\n\n4. Add the number of beds from both types of rooms to find the total number of beds.\n   \\[\n   16 + 15 = 31\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of beds at Palm Meadows is \\(\\boxed{31}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of beds at Palm Meadows, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 13 hotel rooms in total.
