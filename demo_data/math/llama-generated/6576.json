        "To determine how many trips Elysse and her brother will need to carry 30 bags of groceries, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bags Elysse and her brother can carry in one trip together.\n2. Determine how many trips are required to carry 30 bags of groceries.\n\nFirst, we know that Elysse can carry 3 bags of groceries per trip and her brother can also carry 3 bags of groceries per trip. Therefore, together they can carry:\n\\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \\text{ bags per trip} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many trips are required to carry 30 bags of groceries. We do this by dividing the total number of bags by the number of bags they can carry per trip:\n\\[ 30 \\div 6 = 5 \\]\n\nSo, it will take them 5 trips to carry 30 bags of groceries. The final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]",
