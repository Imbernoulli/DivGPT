        "To determine Rhett's rent expense per month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Rhett's monthly salary after taxes.\n2. Determine the total cost of the two late rent payments.\n3. Use the information that the total cost of the two late rent payments is equal to 3/5 of his next month's salary after taxes to find the rent expense per month.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate Rhett's monthly salary after taxes.\n   Rhett's monthly salary is $5000 and he pays 10% tax. Therefore, his salary after taxes is:\n   \\[\n   5000 - (5000 \\times 0.10) = 5000 - 500 = 4500\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the total cost of the two late rent payments.\n   According to the problem, the total cost of the two late rent payments is equal to 3/5 of his next month's salary after taxes. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{5} \\times 4500 = \\frac{3 \\times 4500}{5} = \\frac{13500}{5} = 2700\n   \\]\n   This means the total cost of the two late rent payments is $2700.\n\n3. Use the total cost of the two late rent payments to find the rent expense per month.\n   Since the total cost of the two late rent payments is $2700, the rent expense per month is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2700}{2} = 1350\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Rhett's rent expense per month is \\(\\boxed{1350}\\).",

Set up an equation to find the monthly rent.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Rhett's after-tax salary.**\n\nRhett's monthly salary before taxes is $5000, and he pays 10% tax.
