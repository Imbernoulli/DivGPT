        "To determine how many minutes of Netflix Gina gets to choose, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of shows Gina watches:**\n   Gina chooses what she and her sister will watch three times as often as her sister. Let \\( x \\) be the number of shows her sister chooses. Therefore, Gina chooses \\( 3x \\) shows.\n\n2. **Set up the equation for the total number of shows:**\n   The total number of shows watched by both Gina and her sister is given as 24. Thus, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   x + 3x = 24\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   Combine the terms on the left side:\n   \\[\n   4x = 24\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 4:\n   \\[\n   x = 6\n   \\]\n   So, her sister watches 6 shows.\n\n4. **Determine the number of shows Gina watches:**\n   Since Gina watches three times as many shows as her sister:\n   \\[\n   3x = 3 \\times 6 = 18\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total minutes of Netflix Gina gets to choose:**\n   Each show is 50 minutes long. Therefore, the total minutes for 18 shows is:\n   \\[\n   18 \\times 50 = 900\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of minutes of Netflix Gina gets to choose is \\(\\boxed{900}\\).",
        "To determine how many minutes of Netflix Gina gets to choose, we start by figuring out how many shows Gina chooses. According to the problem, Gina chooses what she and her sister will watch three times as often as her sister does.

        "To determine how many minutes of Netflix Gina gets to choose, we start by understanding the relationship between the number of shows Gina chooses and the number of shows her sister chooses. According to the problem, Gina chooses shows three times as often as her sister.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of shows Gina's sister chooses as \\( x \\). Since Gina chooses shows three times as often as her sister, the number of shows Gina chooses is \\( 3x \\).\n\nWe know from the problem statement that the total number of shows watched by both Gina and her sister is 24.

Determine the total number of shows chosen by both Gina and her sister.\n3. Calculate the total number of minutes Gina gets to choose.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of shows Gina chooses.**\n\nGina chooses shows three times as often as her sister. Since her sister watches 24 shows per week, we can calculate the number of shows Gina chooses as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of shows Gina chooses} = 3 \\times 24 = 72 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of shows chosen by both Gina and her sister.**\n\nThe total number of shows chosen by both Gina and her sister is the sum of the shows each of them chooses:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of shows chosen} = 72 + 24 = 96 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes Gina gets to choose.**\n\nEach show is 50 minutes long, so the total number of minutes Gina gets to choose is:\n\\[ \\text{Total minutes Gina gets to choose} = \\frac{72}{96} \\times (24 \\times 50) \\]\nFirst, simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{72}{96}\\):\n\\[ \\frac{72}{96} = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\nThen, calculate \\(24 \\times 50\\):\n\\[ 24 \\times 50 = 1200 \\]\nNow, multiply \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) by 1200:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} \\times 1200 = 900 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of minutes of Netflix Gina gets to choose is \\(\\boxed{900}\\).",
        "To determine how many minutes of Netflix Gina gets to choose, we start by finding out how many shows Gina watches per week. According to the problem, Gina chooses what she and her sister will watch three times as often as her sister does. This means that for every show her sister chooses, Gina chooses 3 shows. Therefore, the total number of shows watched per week can be expressed as the sum of the shows chosen by Gina and her sister.\n\nLet's denote the number of shows her sister chooses per week as \\( S \\). Since Gina chooses 3 times as many shows as her sister, the number of shows Gina chooses per week is \\( 3S \\). The total number of shows watched per week is then given by:\n\\[ S + 3S = 4S \\]\n\nWe know from the problem that the total number of shows watched per week is 24. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 4S = 24 \\]\n\nTo find \\( S \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[ S = \\frac{24}{4} = 6 \\]\n\nSo, her sister chooses 6 shows per week. Since Gina chooses 3 times as many shows as her sister, the number of shows Gina chooses per week is:\n\\[ 3S = 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\]\n\nEach show is 50 minutes long, so the total number of minutes of Netflix Gina gets to choose is:\n\\[ 18 \\times 50 = 900 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of minutes of Netflix Gina gets to choose is \\(\\boxed{900}\\).",
        "To determine how many minutes of Netflix Gina gets to choose, we first need to find out how many shows Gina watches and then calculate the total minutes for those shows.\n\n1. **Determine the number of shows Gina watches:**\n   - Gina chooses what she and her sister will watch three times as often as her sister.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of shows Gina's sister chooses.\n   - Therefore, Gina chooses \\( 3x \\) shows.\n\n2. **Set up the equation for the total number of shows:**\n   - The total number of shows watched by both Gina and her sister is given as 24.\n   - So, \\( x + 3x = 24 \\).\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   4x = 24\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of shows Gina watches:**\n   \\[\n   3x = 3 \\times 6 = 18\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the total minutes of Netflix Gina gets to choose:**\n   - Each show is 50 minutes long.\n   - Therefore, the total minutes for 18 shows is:\n     \\[\n     18 \\times 50 = 900\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of minutes of Netflix that Gina gets to choose is \\(\\boxed{900}\\).",
