Additionally, Davey has three times as many guitars as Barbeck, so Davey has \\( 3 \\times 2S = 6S \\) guitars. The total number of guitars is the sum of the guitars that Steve, Barbeck, and Davey have, which is given as 27. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ S + 2S + 6S = 27 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ 9S = 27 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( S \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 9:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{27}{9} = 3 \\]\n\nSo, Steve has 3 guitars. Since Barbeck has two times as many guitars as Steve, Barbeck has:\n\n\\[ 2S = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\]\n\nAnd since Davey has three times as many guitars as Barbeck, Davey has:\n\n\\[ 6S = 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of guitars Davey has is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
