        "To determine how much money Hannah has left after her expenditures at the county fair, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount spent on rides:**\n   Hannah spent half of her $30 on rides.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n   So, she spent $15 on rides.\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount spent:**\n   Hannah spent $15 on rides and $5 on dessert.\n   \\[\n   15 + 5 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, she spent a total of $20.\n\n3. **Calculate the amount of money left:**\n   Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Hannah brought.\n   \\[\n   30 - 20 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, she has $10 left.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Hannah has left is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "To determine how much money Hannah has left after her expenditures at the county fair, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial amount of money Hannah brought to the fair, which is $30.\n2. Calculate the amount of money Hannah spent on rides. Since she spent half of her initial amount on rides, we perform the following calculation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n   So, Hannah spent $15 on rides.\n3. Next, we subtract the amount spent on rides from the initial amount:\n   \\[\n   30 - 15 = 15\n   \\]\n   Now, Hannah has $15 left.\n4. Hannah then spends $5 on dessert. We subtract the amount spent on dessert from the remaining amount:\n   \\[\n   15 - 5 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, Hannah has $10 left after spending on dessert.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Hannah has left is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

Subtract the amount spent on rides from the initial amount of money.\n3. Subtract the amount spent on dessert from the remaining amount.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\nHannah spent half of her $30 on rides. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount spent on rides} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount spent on rides from the initial amount of money:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining amount after rides} = 30 - 15 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThen, we subtract the amount spent on dessert from the remaining amount:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining amount after dessert} = 15 - 5 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo, the amount of money Hannah has left is \\boxed{10}.",
        "To determine how much money Hannah has left after her expenses at the county fair, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much money Hannah spent on rides. Since she spent half of her $30 on rides, we perform the following calculation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n   So, Hannah spent $15 on rides.\n\n2. Add the amount she spent on dessert to the amount she spent on rides. Hannah spent $5 on dessert, so we add $15 and $5:\n   \\[\n   15 + 5 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, Hannah spent a total of $20 on rides and dessert.\n\n3. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Hannah brought to the county fair. Hannah started with $30, so we subtract $20 from $30:\n   \\[\n   30 - 20 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, Hannah has $10 left.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Hannah has left is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
