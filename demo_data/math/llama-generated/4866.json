        "To determine how many marbles Rhonda has, we start by defining variables for the number of marbles each person has. Let's say Rhonda has \\( R \\) marbles. Since Amon owns 55 marbles more than Rhonda, Amon has \\( R + 55 \\) marbles. According to the problem, the total number of marbles Amon and Rhonda combined have is 215. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\n\\[ R + (R + 55) = 215 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2R + 55 = 215 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( R \\), we subtract 55 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2R = 160 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ R = 80 \\]\n\nSo, Rhonda has \\(\\boxed{80}\\) marbles.",
