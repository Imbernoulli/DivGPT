        "To determine how many students play both hockey and tennis, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students who play tennis.\n2. Determine how many of those students also play hockey.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students play tennis. We know that 3/4 of the 600 students play tennis. So, we multiply 600 by 3/4:\n\\[\n600 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 600 \\times 0.75 = 450\n\\]\nTherefore, 450 students play tennis.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these 450 students also play hockey. We know that 60% of the students who play tennis also play hockey. So, we multiply 450 by 60% (or 0.60):\n\\[\n450 \\times 0.60 = 270\n\\]\nTherefore, 270 students play both hockey and tennis.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{270}\n\\]",
