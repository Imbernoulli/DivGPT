Since Jack's basket can hold 12 apples when full, Jill's basket can hold:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\nSo, Jill's basket can hold 24 apples.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many times Jack's current number of apples (which is 8) can fit into Jill's basket (which can hold 24 apples). We do this by dividing the capacity of Jill's basket by the current number of apples in Jack's basket:\n\\[ 24 \\div 8 = 3 \\]\nSo, Jack's current number of apples can fit into Jill's basket 3 times.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]",
