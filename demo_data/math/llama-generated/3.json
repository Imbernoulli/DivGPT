        "To determine the number of daisies sold on the fourth day, we need to calculate the number of daisies sold on each of the first three days and then use the total sales over the four days to find the number of daisies sold on the fourth day.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many daisies were sold on the second day. According to the problem, the flower shop sold 20 more flowers on the second day than they did on the first day. Since they sold 45 daisies on the first day, we can calculate the number of daisies sold on the second day as follows:\n\\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many daisies were sold on the third day. The problem states that they sold 10 less than twice the number of flowers sold on the second day. Since they sold 65 daisies on the second day, we can calculate the number of daisies sold on the third day as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 65 - 10 = 130 - 10 = 120 \\]\n\nNow, we know the number of daisies sold on each of the first three days:\n- First day: 45 daisies\n- Second day: 65 daisies\n- Third day: 120 daisies\n\nTo find the number of daisies sold on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of daisies sold over the first three days from the total number of daisies sold over the four days. The total number of daisies sold over the four days is 350. Therefore, we calculate the total number of daisies sold over the first three days as follows:\n\\[ 45 + 65 + 120 = 230 \\]\n\nThen, we subtract this total from 350 to find the number of daisies sold on the fourth day:\n\\[ 350 - 230 = 120 \\]\n\nThus, the number of daisies sold on the fourth day is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
