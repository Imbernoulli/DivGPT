        "To determine Skye's average speed for the entire race, we need to calculate the total time he took to complete the 6-kilometer track and then divide the total distance by the total time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time taken for each segment of the race:\n\n1. **First 3 kilometers:**\n   - Speed: 150 kilometers per hour\n   - Distance: 3 kilometers\n   - Time: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Time}_1 = \\frac{\\text{Distance}_1}{\\text{Speed}_1} = \\frac{3 \\text{ km}}{150 \\text{ km/h}} = 0.02 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Next 2 kilometers:**\n   - Speed: 150 kilometers per hour + 50 kilometers per hour = 200 kilometers per hour\n   - Distance: 2 kilometers\n   - Time:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time}_2 = \\frac{\\text{Distance}_2}{\\text{Speed}_2} = \\frac{2 \\text{ km}}{200 \\text{ km/h}} = 0.01 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Remaining 1 kilometer:**\n   - Speed: 2 times 150 kilometers per hour = 300 kilometers per hour\n   - Distance: 1 kilometer\n   - Time:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time}_3 = \\frac{\\text{Distance}_3}{\\text{Speed}_3} = \\frac{1 \\text{ km}}{300 \\text{ km/h}} = 0.003333 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nNext, we sum the times for all segments to find the total time taken:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = \\text{Time}_1 + \\text{Time}_2 + \\text{Time}_3 = 0.02 \\text{ hours} + 0.01 \\text{ hours} + 0.003333 \\text{ hours} = 0.033333 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} = \\frac{6 \\text{ km}}{0.033333 \\text{ hours}} = 180 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Skye's average speed for the entire race is \\(\\boxed{180}\\) kilometers per hour.",

Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Calculate the time taken for each segment of the race:**\n   - For the first 3 kilometers, Skye's speed was 150 kilometers per hour. The time taken for this segment is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time}_1 = \\frac{3 \\text{ km}}{150 \\text{ km/h}} = \\frac{1}{50} \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n   - For the next 2 kilometers, Skye's speed was 50 kilometers per hour more than 150 kilometers per hour, which is 200 kilometers per hour. The time taken for this segment is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time}_2 = \\frac{2 \\text{ km}}{200 \\text{ km/h}} = \\frac{1}{100} \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n   - For the remaining 1 kilometer, Skye's speed was twice as fast as his speed on the first 3 kilometers, which is 300 kilometers per hour. The time taken for this segment is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time}_3 = \\frac{1 \\text{ km}}{300 \\text{ km/h}} = \\frac{1}{300} \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total time taken for the entire race:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\text{Time}_1 + \\text{Time}_2 + \\text{Time}_3 = \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{1}{300}\n   \\]\n   To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 50, 100, and 300 is 300. So we rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 300:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{6}{300}, \\quad \\frac{1}{100} = \\frac{3}{300}, \\quad \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{1}{300}\n   \\]\n   Adding these fractions together, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\frac{6}{300} + \\frac{3}{300} + \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{10}{300} = \\frac{1}{30} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the average speed:**\n   The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} = \\frac{6 \\text{ km}}{\\frac{1}{30} \\text{ hours}} = 6 \\times 30 = 180 \\text{ km/h}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Skye's average speed for the entire race is \\(\\boxed{180}\\) kilometers per hour.",

The common denominator for 0.02 (which is \\(\\frac{2}{100}\\)), 0.01 (which is \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\)), and \\(\\frac{1}{300}\\) is 300.\n\nConvert \\(\\frac{2}{100}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\) to fractions with a denominator of 300:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{100} = \\frac{2 \\times 3}{100 \\times 3} = \\frac{6}{300}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{100} = \\frac{1 \\times 3}{100 \\times 3} = \\frac{3}{300}\n\\]\n\nNow add the fractions:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = \\frac{6}{300} + \\frac{3}{300} + \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{6 + 3 + 1}{300} = \\frac{10}{300} = \\frac{1}{30} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} = \\frac{6 \\text{ km}}{\\frac{1}{30} \\text{ hours}} = 6 \\text{ km} \\times 30 \\text{ hours}^{-1} = 180 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nThus, Skye's average speed for the entire race is \\(\\boxed{180}\\) kilometers per hour.",

Therefore, his speed for this segment is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed}_3 = 2 \\times 150 \\text{ km/h} = 300 \\text{ km/h}\n   \\]\n   The time taken for this segment is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time}_3 = \\frac{\\text{Distance}_3}{\\text{Speed}_3} = \\frac{1 \\text{ km}}{300 \\text{ km/h}} = \\frac{1}{300} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we sum the times taken for all three segments to find the total time:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = \\text{Time}_1 + \\text{Time}_2 + \\text{Time}_3 = \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{1}{300}\n\\]\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 50, 100, and 300 is 300. So, we rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 300:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{6}{300}, \\quad \\frac{1}{100} = \\frac{3}{300}, \\quad \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{1}{300}\n\\]\nAdding these fractions together, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = \\frac{6}{300} + \\frac{3}{300} + \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{10}{300} = \\frac{1}{30} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} = \\frac{6 \\text{ km}}{\\frac{1}{30} \\text{ hours}} = 6 \\text{ km} \\times 30 \\text{ hours}^{-1} = 180 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nThus, Skye's average speed for the entire race is \\(\\boxed{180}\\) kilometers per hour."
