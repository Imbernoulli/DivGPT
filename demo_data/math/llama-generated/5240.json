        "To determine how many feet of fabric Nguyen still needs for the pants, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of fabric required to make 7 pairs of pants.\n2. Convert the amount of fabric Nguyen already has from yards to feet.\n3. Subtract the amount of fabric Nguyen already has from the total amount required to find out how much more fabric he needs.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of fabric required to make 7 pairs of pants.**\n\nEach pair of pants requires 8.5 feet of fabric, and Nguyen is making 7 pairs. Therefore, the total amount of fabric required is:\n\\[ 8.5 \\text{ feet/pair} \\times 7 \\text{ pairs} = 59.5 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Convert the amount of fabric Nguyen already has from yards to feet.**\n\nThere are 3 feet in a yard. Nguyen has 3.5 yards of fabric, so we convert this to feet by multiplying by 3:\n\\[ 3.5 \\text{ yards} \\times 3 \\text{ feet/yard} = 10.5 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the amount of fabric Nguyen already has from the total amount required to find out how much more fabric he needs.**\n\nThe total amount of fabric required is 59.5 feet, and Nguyen already has 10.5 feet. Therefore, the amount of fabric he still needs is:\n\\[ 59.5 \\text{ feet} - 10.5 \\text{ feet} = 49 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nSo, Nguyen still needs \\(\\boxed{49}\\) feet of fabric.",
