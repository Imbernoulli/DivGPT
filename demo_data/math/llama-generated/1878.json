If he has 40 pairs of pants, we can calculate the number of shirts as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of shirts} = 6 \\times 40 = 240\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the number of shirts to the number of pants to find the total number of pieces of clothes:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of pieces of clothes} = \\text{Number of shirts} + \\text{Number of pants} = 240 + 40 = 280\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pieces of clothes Mr. Jones owns is \\boxed{280}.",
