Therefore, her total commission is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Commission} = 0.12 \\times 24000 = 2880\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much of her commission is allocated to her personal needs.**\n\nSixty percent of her commission will be allocated to her personal needs. Therefore, the amount allocated to her personal needs is:\n\\[\n\\text{Personal needs} = 0.60 \\times 2880 = 1728\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how much of her commission is saved.**\n\nThe rest of her commission will be saved.

Therefore, her total earnings are:\n\\[ 0.12 \\times 24000 = 2880 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much of her earnings will be allocated to her personal needs.
