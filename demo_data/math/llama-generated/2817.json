        "To determine how many more sandwiches Samson ate on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches he ate on each day and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of sandwiches Samson ate on Monday:\n- At lunch, Samson ate 3 sandwiches.\n- At dinner, Samson ate twice as many sandwiches as he did at lunch. Since he ate 3 sandwiches at lunch, he ate \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) sandwiches at dinner.\n- Therefore, the total number of sandwiches Samson ate on Monday is \\(3 + 6 = 9\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of sandwiches Samson ate on Tuesday:\n- Samson only ate 1 sandwich for breakfast.\n- Therefore, the total number of sandwiches Samson ate on Tuesday is 1.\n\nNow, we find the difference in the total number of sandwiches eaten on Monday and Tuesday:\n- The difference is \\(9 - 1 = 8\\).\n\nThus, Samson ate \\(\\boxed{8}\\) more sandwiches on Monday than on Tuesday.",
