Use the information given to find the number of pages in the science book.\n\nFirst, we know that the history book has 300 pages.\n\nNext, we are told that the novel has half as many pages as the history book. Therefore, we calculate the number of pages in the novel as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pages in the novel} = \\frac{\\text{Number of pages in the history book}}{2} = \\frac{300}{2} = 150\n\\]\n\nThen, we are told that the science book has 4 times the number of pages as the novel. Therefore, we calculate the number of pages in the science book as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pages in the science book} = 4 \\times \\text{Number of pages in the novel} = 4 \\times 150 = 600\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of pages in the science book is \\boxed{600}.",
