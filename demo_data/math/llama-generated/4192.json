        "To determine the cost for a customer buying 3 pairs of jeans with the given discount, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Identify the price of one pair of jeans: $40.\n2. Determine the discount私立: 10% for every two pairs of jeans bought together.\n\nSince the customer is buying 3 pairs of jeans, they can buy 2 pairs at the discounted price and 1 pair at the regular price.\n\nFirst, calculate the cost for the 2 pairs of jeans at the discounted price:\n- The original price for 2 pairs is $40 + $40 = $80.\n- With a 10% discount, the price is $80 - (10% of $80) = $80 - $8 = $72.\n\nNext, calculate the cost for the 1 pair of jeans at the regular price:\n- The price for 1 pair is $40.\n\nNow, add the cost of the 2 pairs at the discounted price and the cost of the 1 pair at the regular price:\n- Total cost = $72 + $40 = $112.\n\nTherefore, the customer will pay \\(\\boxed{112}\\) dollars for 3 pairs of jeans.",
        "To determine the total cost a customer will pay for 3 pairs of jeans given the discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.

Calculate the cost for two pairs of jeans after the discount.\n   - The original cost for two pairs of jeans is \\(2 \\times 40 = 80\\) dollars.\n   - The discount on two pairs of jeans is \\(10\\% \\times 80 = 0.10 \\times 80 = 8\\) dollars.\n   - Therefore, the cost for two pairs of jeans after the discount is \\(80 - 8 = 72\\) dollars.\n\n3. Determine the cost for the third pair of jeans.\n   - Since the discount only applies to every two pairs, the third pair of jeans will be sold at the original price of $40.\n\n4. Calculate the total cost for three pairs of jeans.\n   - The total cost is the cost of two pairs of jeans after the discount plus the cost of one pair of jeans at the original price.\n   - This is \\(72 + 40 = 112\\) dollars.\n\nThus, the customer will pay \\(\\boxed{112}\\) dollars for 3 pairs of jeans.",

Calculate the cost of the remaining pair of jeans without the discount.\n5. Add the discounted cost of the sets of 2 pairs to the cost of the remaining pair.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The cost of one pair of jeans is $40.

        "To determine the total cost a customer will pay for 3 pairs of jeans given the discount policy, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of one pair of jeans, which is $40.\n2. Determine the discount policy: a 10% discount is applied for every two pairs of jeans bought at a time.\n3. Calculate the cost for 2 pairs of jeans with the discount.\n4. Determine the cost for the remaining 1 pair of jeans without a discount.\n5. Add the two amounts together to get the total cost.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The cost of one pair of jeans is $40.\n2. For every two pairs of jeans, the discount is 10%. Therefore, the cost for 2 pairs of jeans is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 40 = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   With a 10% discount, the customer pays:\n   \\[\n   80 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 80 \\times 0.90 = 72 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n3. The cost for the remaining 1 pair of jeans is:\n   \\[\n   40 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n4. Adding the cost of 2 pairs of jeans with the discount and the cost of 1 pair of jeans without a discount gives:\n   \\[\n   72 + 40 = 112 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount a customer will pay for 3 pairs of jeans is \\(\\boxed{112}\\).",
        "To determine the total cost a customer will pay for 3 pairs of jeans, we need to consider the discount offered by the store. The store gives a 10% discount on every two pairs of jeans bought at a time.\n\nFirst, let's break down the purchase into units of two pairs and one additional pair:\n- The customer is buying 3 pairs of jeans.\n- This can be split into 2 pairs and 1 additional pair.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the two pairs of jeans with the discount:\n- The original price of one pair of jeans is $40.\n- Therefore, the cost for two pairs of jeans without the discount is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 40 = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- The store offers a 10% discount on these two pairs. The discount amount is:\n  \\[\n  10\\% \\text{ of } 80 = 0.10 \\times 80 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- Thus, the cost for two pairs of jeans after the discount is:\n  \\[\n  80 - 8 = 72 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the cost of the additional single pair of jeans:\n- The original price of one pair of jeans is $40.\n\nFinally, we add the cost of the two discounted pairs and the cost of the single pair to find the total cost:\n\\[\n72 + 40 = 112 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount a customer will pay for 3 pairs of jeans is \\(\\boxed{112}\\)."
