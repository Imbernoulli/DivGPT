        "To determine how many parents disagree with the tuition fee increase, we first need to find out how many parents agree with the increase. Given that 20% of the 800 parents agree, we can calculate the number of㈬ parents who agree as follows:\n\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 800 = 160\n\\]\n\nThis means that 160 parents agree with the tuition fee increase. To find out how many parents disagree, we subtract the number of parents who agree from the total number of parents:\n\n\\[\n800 - 160 = 640\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of parents who disagree with the tuition fee increase is \\boxed{640}.",

The survey indicates that 20% of the 800 parents agree.\n\nFirst, we calculate 20% of 800:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 800 = 160\n\\]\nSo, 160 parents agree with the tuition fee increase.\n\nNext, we find the number of parents who disagree by subtracting the number of parents who agree from the total number of parents:\n\\[\n800 - 160 = 640\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of parents who disagree with the tuition fee increase is \\boxed{640}."
