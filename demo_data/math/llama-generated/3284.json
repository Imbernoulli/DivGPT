        "To determine how many students remain after 2 students leave, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students initially.\n2. Subtract the number of students who left from the initial total.\n\nFirst, we find the initial total number of students. The teachers divided the students into 3 groups of 8. Therefore, we multiply the number of groups by the number of students per group:\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of students who left from the initial total. Since 2 students left early, we subtract 2 from 24:\n\\[ 24 - 2 = 22 \\]\n\nSo, the number of students who remain is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",

The problem states that the teachers divided the group into 3 groups of 8 students each. So, we multiply the number of groups by the number of students per group:\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of students who left from the total number of students. The problem states that 2 students left early. So, we subtract 2 from 24:\n\\[ 24 - 2 = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students who remain is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",
        "To determine how many students remain after 2 students leave, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students initially.\n2. Subtract the number of students who left from the initial total.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial total number of students. The teachers divided the students into 3 groups of 8. Therefore, the total number of students is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of students who left from the initial total. Since 2 students left early, we subtract 2 from 24:\n\\[ 24 - 2 = 22 \\]\n\nThus, the number of students who remain is:\n\\[ \\boxed{22} \\]",
