It takes 2 gallons of milk to make 1 gallon of sour cream, so the amount of sour cream Bill makes is:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nIt takes 4 gallons of milk to make 1 gallon of butter, so the amount of butter Bill makes is:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{4} = 1 \\text{ gallon} \\]\n\nThe amount of milk Bill keeps as whole milk is:\n\\[ 16 - 4 - 4 = 8 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the revenue Bill earns from selling the sour cream, butter, and whole milk. He sells sour cream for $6 per gallon, butter for $5 per gallon, and whole milk for $3 per gallon. Therefore, the revenue from sour cream is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe revenue from butter is:\n\\[ 1 \\times 5 = 5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe revenue from whole milk is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding these amounts together gives the total revenue:\n\\[ 12 + 5 + 24 = 41 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Bill makes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{41} \\]",
