        "First, we need to calculate Jenny's current property tax. The property tax rate is 2% and her house is currently worth $400,000. So, the current property tax is:\n\n\\[ 0.02 \\times 400,000 = 8,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the increase in the value of the house due to the high-speed rail project. The rail project will increase her house's value by 25%. So, the increase in value is:\n\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 400,000 = 100,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding this increase to the original value of the house, the new value of the house after the rail project is:\n\n\\[ 400,000 + 100,000 = 500,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more Jenny can spend on improvements to her house without exceeding her budget of $15,000 per year on property tax. Let \\( x \\) be the total value of the house after the Face project and the improvements. The property tax on this new value is:\n\n\\[ 0.02 \\times x = 15,000 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{15,000}{0.02} = 750,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe value of the house after the rail project is $500,000, so the maximum amount Jenny can spend on improvements is:\n\n\\[ 750,000 - 500,000 = 250,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of improvements Jenny can make to her house before her property tax bill gets too high is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250000} \\]",
