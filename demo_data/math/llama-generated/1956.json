        "First, we need to calculate Jenny's current property tax. The property tax rate is 2% and her house is currently worth $400,000. So, the current property tax is:\n\n\\[ 0.02 \\times 400,000 = 8,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the increase in the value of the house due to the high-speed rail project. The rail project will increase her house's value by 25%. So, the increase in value is:\n\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 400,000 = 100,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding this increase to the original value of the house, the new value of the house after the rail project is:\n\n\\[ 400,000 + 100,000 = 500,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more Jenny can spend on improvements to her house without exceeding her budget of $15,000 per year on property tax. Let \\( x \\) be the total value of the house after the Face project and the improvements. The property tax on this new value is:\n\n\\[ 0.02 \\times x = 15,000 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{15,000}{0.02} = 750,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe value of the house after the rail project is $500,000, so the maximum amount Jenny can spend on improvements is:\n\n\\[ 750,000 - 500,000 = 250,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of improvements Jenny can make to her house before her property tax bill gets too high is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250000} \\]",

With the high-speed rail project, the maximum property tax she can afford is $15,000.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the maximum value of the house Jenny can afford before exceeding her budget.**\n\nThe property tax rate is 2%. Let \\( V \\) be the maximum value of the house Jenny can afford. The property tax on this house would be:\n\\[ 0.02V = 15,000 \\]\nSolving for \\( V \\):\n\\[ V = \\frac{15,000}{0.02} = 750,000 \\]\n\nThis is the maximum value of the house Jenny can afford. Since the value of the house after the high-speed rail project is $500,000, the maximum value of the improvements she can make to her house is:\n\\[ 750,000 - 500,000 = 250,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of improvements Jenny can make to her house before her property tax bill gets too high is \\(\\boxed{250000}\\).",

The property tax rate is 2%.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Maximum property tax} = 15,000\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the maximum value of the house Jenny can have without exceeding the maximum property tax.**\n\nThe property tax rate is 2%, so the maximum value of the house \\( V \\) can be found by solving the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.02V = 15,000\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{15,000}{0.02} = 750,000\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Find out how many dollars worth of improvements Jenny can make.**\n\nThe new value of the house after the high-speed rail project is $500,000. The maximum value of the house Jenny can have is $750,000. The amount of improvements she can make is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Improvements} = 750,000 - 500,000 = 250,000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of dollars worth of improvements Jenny can make to her house before her property tax bill gets too high is \\(\\boxed{250000}\\).",

        "First, we calculate the current property tax on Jenny's house. The property tax rate is 2%, and the current value of the house is $400,000.
