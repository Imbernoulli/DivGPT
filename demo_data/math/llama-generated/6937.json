        "Let's denote the initial number of hairs Anya starts with as \\( x \\).\n\n1. When Anya washes her hair, she loses 32 hairs. So, after washing, the number of hairs she has is \\( x - 32 \\).\n2. When Anya brushes her hair, she loses half the amount of hairs she lost when she washed it. Since she lost 32 hairs when she washed it, she loses \\( \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\) hairs when she brushes it. So, after brushing, the number of hairs she has is \\( x - 32 - 16 = x - 48 \\).\n3. Afterscopes her hair, she grows back some hairs. Let's say she grows back \\( y \\) hairs. So, after growing back the hairs, the number of hairs she has is \\( x - 48 + y \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, after washing, brushing, and growing back the hairs, Anya should have one more hair than she started with. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ x - 48 + y = x + 1 \\]\n\nTo find \\( y \\), we can subtract \\( x \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ -48 + y = 1 \\]\n\nThen, we add 48 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ y = 49 \\]\n\nSo, Anya has to grow back \\(\\boxed{49}\\) hairs to always have one more hair than she started with after washing, brushing, and growing it.",

Let's denote the initial number of hairs Anya starts with as \\( x \\).\n2. When Anya washes her hair, she loses 32 hairs. So, after washing, the number of hairs she has left is \\( x - 32 \\).\n3. When Anya brushes her hair, she loses half the amount she lost when washing, which is \\( \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\) hairs. So, after brushing, the number of hairs she has left is \\( x - 32 - 16 = x - 48 \\).\n4. Let's say Anya grows back \\( y \\) hairs after washing and brushing. After growing back the hairs, the number of hairs she has is \\( x - 48 + y \\).\n5. We want the final number of hairs to be one more than the initial number of hairs, so we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   x - 48 + y = x + 1\n   \\]\n6. To find \\( y \\), we can subtract \\( x \\) from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   -48 + y = 1\n   \\]\n7. Then, we add 48 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   y = 49\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Anya has to grow back \\(\\boxed{49}\\) hairs to always have one more hair than she started with after washing, brushing, and growing it."
