        "To determine how many grams of pie Sophia ate, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the fraction of the pie that Sophia put in the fridge.\n2. Use the weight of the pie left in the fridge to find the total weight of the pie.\n3. Calculate the weight of the pie that Sophia ate.\n\nFirst, since Sophia ate \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of the pie, the fraction of the pie that she put in the fridge is:\n\\[1 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}\\]\n\nNext, we know that the pie left in the fridge weighs 1200 grams. This means that \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) of the total pie weighs 1200 grams. Let \\(W\\) be the total weight of the pie. Then:\n\\[\\frac{5}{6}W = 1200\\]\n\nTo find \\(W\\), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\), which is \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\):\n\\[W = 1200 \\times \\frac{6}{5} = 1200 \\times 1.2 = 1440\\]\n\nSo, the total weight of the pie is 1440 grams.
