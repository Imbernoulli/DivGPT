        "Let's denote Austin's height by \\( h \\) feet. According to the problem, the shortest wave he caught was four feet higher than his height. Therefore, the height of the shortest wave is \\( h + 4 \\) feet.\n\nThe problem also states that the shortest wave was three feet higher than the length of his 7-foot surfboard. Therefore, we can write the equation for the height of the shortest wave as:\n\\[ h + 4 = 7 + 3 \\]\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ h + 4 = 10 \\]\nTo find Austin's height, we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ h = 10 - 4 \\]\n\\[ h = 6 \\]\nSo, Austin's height is 6 feet.\n\nNext, we need to find the height of the highest wave Austin caught. The problem states that the highest wave was two feet higher than four times his height. Therefore, the height of the highest wave is:\n\\[ 4h + 2 \\]\nSubstituting Austin's height \\( h = 6 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 4(6) + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \\]\nSo, the height of the highest wave Austin caught is \\(\\boxed{26}\\) feet.",
        "To determine the height of the highest wave Austin caught, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Austin's height.\n2. Use Austin's height to find the height of the shortest wave.\n3. Use the height of the shortest wave to find the height of the highest wave.\n\nLet's start with Austin's height. We know from the problem that the shortest wave he caught was four feet higher than his height. We also know that the shortest wave was three feet higher than the length of his 7-foot surfboard. Therefore, we can set up the following equation for the height of the shortest wave:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height of the shortest wave} = 7 + 3 = 10 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nSince the shortest wave is four feet higher than Austin's height, we can find Austin's height by subtracting 4 feet from the height of the shortest wave:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Austin's height} = 10 - 4 = 6 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Austin's height is 6 feet, we can find the height of the highest wave. The highest wave is two feet higher than four times Austin's height. Therefore, we can set up the following equation for the height of the highest wave:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height of the highest wave} = 4 \\times 6 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThus, the height of the highest wave Austin caught is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).",

        "To determine the height of the highest wave Austin caught, we need to follow the information given step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find out Austin's height. We know that the shortest wave he caught was four feet higher than his height, and it was also three feet higher than his 7-foot surfboard. Let's denote Austin's height by \\( h \\).\n\nFrom the information about the shortest wave, we can write the following equation:\n\\[ \\text{Shortest wave} = h + 4 \\]\nSince the shortest wave was also three feet higher than his 7-foot surfboard, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Shortest wave} = 7 + 3 = 10 \\]\nSo, we can set the two expressions for the shortest wave equal to each other:\n\\[ h + 4 = 10 \\]\nSolving for \\( h \\), we get:\n\\[ h = 10 - 4 = 6 \\]\nTherefore, Austin's height is 6 feet.\n\nNext, we need to find the height of the highest wave Austin caught. We know that the highest wave was two feet higher than four times his height. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Highest wave} = 4h + 2 \\]\nSubstituting Austin's height (6 feet) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Highest wave} = 4 \\times 6 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \\]\nTherefore, the height of the highest wave Austin caught is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).",

Use the height of the shortest wave to find the height of the highest wave.\n\nLet's start by identifying Austin's height. We know that the shortest wave was four feet higher than his height. We also know that the shortest wave was three feet higher than his 7-foot surfboard. Therefore, we can set up the following equation for the height of the shortest wave:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height of the shortest wave} = 7 + 3 = 10 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nSince the shortest wave was four feet higher than Austin's height, we can find Austin's height by subtracting 4 from the height of the shortest wave:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Austin's height} = 10 - 4 = 6 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Austin's height, we can find the height of the highest wave. The highest wave was two feet higher than four times Austin's height. First, we calculate four times Austin's height:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times \\text{Austin's height} = 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThen, we add 2 feet to this value to find the height of the highest wave:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height of the highest wave} = 24 + 2 = 26 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the highest wave Austin caught is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{26}\n\\]",
