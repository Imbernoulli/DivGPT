Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many beanie babies Sydney has:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of beanie babies Sydney has} = \\frac{\\text{Number of beanie babies Lori has}}{15} = \\frac{300}{15} \\]\n\nPerforming the division, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of beanie babies Sydney has} = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of beanie babies Lori has to the number of beanie babies Sydney has to find the total number of beanie babies they have together:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of beanie babies} = \\text{Number of beanie babies Lori has} + \\text{Number of beanie babies Sydney has} = 300 + 20 = 320 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of beanie babies they have is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{320} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of beanie babies Lori and Sydney have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many beanie babies Sydney has. We know that Lori owns 15 times as many beanie babies as Sydney. Since Lori has 300 beanie babies, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of beanie babies Lori has} = 15 \\times \\text{Number of beanie babies Sydney has}\n   \\]\n   Let's denote the number of beanie babies Sydney has by \\( S \\).
