        "To determine the percentage of the altered votes that were for Game of Thrones, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of votes Fran throws away for each book.\n2. Determine the new number of votes for each book after Fran throws some away.\n3. Find the total number of altered votes.\n4. Calculate the percentage of the altered votes that were for Game of Thrones.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of votes Fran throws away for each book.**\n\n- For The Art of the Deal: Fran throws away 80% of the votes.\n  \\[\n  0.80 \\times 20 = 16\n  \\]\n  So, Fran throws away 16 votes for The Art of the Deal. Therefore, the remaining votes for The Art of the Deal are:\n  \\[\n  20 - 16 = 4\n  \\]\n\n- For Twilight: Fran throws away half of the votes.\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6\n  \\]\n  So, Fran throws away 6 votes for Twilight. Therefore, the remaining votes for Twilight are:\n  \\[\n  12 - 6 = 6\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the new number of votes for each book after Fran throws some away.**\n\n- Game of Thrones: The number of votes remains the same, which is 10.\n- Twilight: The number of votes is now 6.\n- The Art of the Deal: The number of votes is now 4.\n\n**Step 3: Find the total number of altered votes.**\n\n Add up the remaining votes for all the books:\n\\[\n10 + 6 + 4 = 20\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the altered votes that were for Game of Thrones.**\n\n The percentage of the altered votes that were for Game of Thrones is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{10}{20} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the altered votes that were for Game of Thrones is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
