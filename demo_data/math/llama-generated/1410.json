But on the second day, it warmed up enough that half of the snowdrift melted.  The third day, it snowed again, adding another 6 inches of snow onto the snowdrift.  On the fourth day, another 18 inches of snow fell onto the snowdrift.  If the snowdrift was 34 inches deep at the end of the fourth day, how deep in inches was the drift at the end of the first day?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} + 6 + 18 = 34\n\\]\n\nFirst, combine the constants on the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} + 24 = 34\n\\]\n\nNext, isolate the term with \\( x \\) by subtracting 24 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\nThen, solve for \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the first day was \\(\\boxed{20}\\) inches.",
