        "To determine how many apples Reginald sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the repairs.\n2. Determine the total amount of money Reginald earned.\n3. Find out how many apples he sold based on the total earnings.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the repairs.**\n\nThe repairs cost 25% of what his bike cost. The bike cost $80.\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of repairs} = 0.25 \\times 80 = 20\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total amount of money Reginald earned.**\n\nAfter paying for the repairs, 1/5 of the money he earned remains. Let \\( E \\) be the total amount of money Reginald earned. After paying $20 for repairs, he has \\( E - 20 \\) dollars left. According to the problem, this remaining amount is 1/5 of his total earnings.\n\\[\nE - 20 = \\frac{1}{5}E\n\\]\nTo find \\( E \\), we need to solve this equation. First, isolate \\( E \\) on one side of the equation by subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{5}E \\) from both sides:\n\\[\nE - \\frac{1}{5}E = 20\n\\]\nCombine the terms on the left side:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{5}E - \\frac{1}{5}E = 20\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5}E = 20\n\\]\nNext, solve for \\( E \\) by multiplying both sides by \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\):\n\\[\nE = 20 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = 25\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many apples he sold.**\n\nReginald sold each apple for $1.25. If he earned a total of $25, the number of apples he sold is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of apples} = \\frac{25}{1.25} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of apples Reginald sold is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
        "To determine how many apples Reginald sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the repairs.\n2.

After paying for the repairs, 1/5 of his earnings remain. Let's denote the total earnings by \\( E \\). According to the problem, after paying $20 for the repairs, 1/5 of the earnings remain. This means that the remaining money is \\( \\frac{1}{5}E \\), and the money spent on repairs is \\( E - \\frac{1}{5}E = \\frac{4}{5}E \\).

Determine the total amount of money Reginald earned before paying for the repairs.\n3. Find out how many apples Reginald sold based on his earnings.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the repairs.**\n\nThe bike cost $80 and the repairs cost 25% of the bike's cost. Therefore, the cost of the repairs is:\n\\[ 80 \\times 0.25 = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total amount of money Reginald earned before paying for the repairs.**\n\nAfter paying for the repairs, Reginald has $1/5 of his total earnings remaining. This means that the $20 he paid for the repairs is $4/5 of his total earnings. Let \\( E \\) be the total amount of money Reginald earned. Then:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{5}E = 20 \\]\n\nTo find \\( E \\), we solve for \\( E \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\):\n\\[ E = 20 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = 25 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many apples Reginald sold based on his earnings.**\n\nReginald earns $1.25 for each apple he sells. Therefore, the number of apples he sold is:\n\\[ \\frac{25}{1.25} = 20 \\]\n\nSo, the number of apples Reginald sold is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

Let's denote the total amount of money earned by \\( E \\). After paying $20 for repairs, the remaining amount is \\( E - 20 \\). According to the problem, this remaining amount is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the total earnings.\n\\[\nE - 20 = \\frac{1}{5}E\n\\]\nTo find \\( E \\), we need to solve this equation. First, eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 5:\n\\[\n5(E - 20) = E\n\\]\n\\[\n5E - 100 = E\n\\]\nNext, isolate \\( E \\) by subtracting \\( E \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n4E =

According to the problem, this remaining amount is 1/5 of the total earnings.\n\\[\nE - 20 = \\frac{1}{5}E\n\\]\nTo find \\( E \\), we can solve this equation by isolating \\( E \\). First, subtract \\(\\frac{1}{5}E\\) from both sides:\n\\[\nE - \\frac{1}{5}E = 20\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{5}E - \\frac{1}{5}E = 20\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5}E = 20\n\\]\nNext, multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\), which is \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\):\n\\[\nE = 20 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = 25\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many apples he sold.**\n\nReginald sold each apple for $1.25.

        "First, let's determine the total cost of the repairs. The repairs cost 25% of the bike's cost. Since the bike cost $80, we calculate the repairs cost as follows:\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 80 = 20\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the repairs is $20.\n\nNext, let's denote the total amount of money Reginald earned from selling apples as \\( x \\). After paying for the repairs, the remaining money is \\( x - 20 \\). According to the problem, after the repairs are paid for, 1/5 of the money he'd earned remains. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\nx - 20 = \\frac{1}{5}x\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first eliminate the fraction by isolating \\( x \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{5}x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\nx - \\frac{1}{5}x = 20\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{5}x - \\frac{1}{5}x = 20\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5}x = 20\n\\]\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\), which is \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\):\n\\[\nx = 20 \\times \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 25\n\\]\nSo, Reginald earned $25 from selling apples. Since he sells each apple for $1.25, the number of apples he sold is:\n\\[\n\\frac{25}{1.25} = 20\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of apples Reginald sold is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

        "To determine how many apples Reginald sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the repairs.\n2. Determine the total amount of money Reginald earned from selling apples.\n3. Use the information about the remaining money after repairs to find out how many apples he sold.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the repairs. The repairs cost 25% of the bike's cost. The bike cost $80, so the repairs cost:\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 80 = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's denote the total amount of money Reginald earned from selling apples as \\( E \\). After paying for the repairs, 1/5 of the money he earned remains. This means that the remaining money is:\n\\[ E - 20 = \\frac{1}{5} E \\]\n\nWe can solve this equation for \\( E \\):\n\\[ E - \\frac{1}{5} E = 20 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{5}{5} E - \\frac{1}{5} E = 20 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{4}{5} E = 20 \\]\n\\[ E = 20 \\times \\frac{5}{4} \\]\n\\[ E = 25 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow we know that Reginald earned $25 from selling apples. Since he sells each apple for $1.25, the number of apples he sold is:\n\\[ \\frac{25}{1.25} = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of apples Reginald sold is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

Then:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of repairs} = \\frac{4}{5}E\n\\]\nWe already know the cost of repairs is $20, so we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n20 = \\frac{4}{5}E\n\\]\nTo find \\( E \\), we solve for \\( E \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\):\n\\[\nE = 20 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = 25 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that Reginald earned $25.

Since the bike cost $80, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of repairs} = 0.25 \\times 80 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's denote the total amount of money Reginald earned before paying for the repairs as \\( E \\). After paying for the repairs, 1/5 of the money he earned remains. This means that the remaining money is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5}E\n\\]\nThe money spent on repairs is \\( E - \\frac{1}{5}E = \\frac{4}{5}E \\). We know that the money spent on repairs is $20, so:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5}E = 20\n\\]\nTo find \\( E \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[\nE = 20 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = 25 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that Reginald earned $25 in total. Since he sells each apple for $1.25, the number of apples he sold is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of apples sold} = \\frac{25}{1.25} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of apples Reginald sold is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",

After paying for the repairs, 1/5 of the money he earned remains. This means that the remaining money is:\n\\[ E - 20 \\]\nAccording to the problem, this remaining money is also equal to 1/5 of the total earnings:\n\\[ E - 20 = \\frac{1}{5}E \\]\n\nTo find \\( E \\), we need to solve this equation. First, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 5:\n\\[ 5(E - 20) = E \\]\n\\[ 5E - 100 = E \\]\nNext, we isolate \\( E \\) by subtracting \\( E \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 5E - E = 100 \\]\n\\[ 4E = 100 \\]\nThen, we solve for \\( E \\) by dividing both sides by 4:\n\\[ E = 25 \\]\n\nSo, Reginald earned $25 in total.

According to the problem, this remaining money is 1/5 of the total earnings:\n\\[ E - 20 = \\frac{1}{5}E \\]\n\nTo find \\( E \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ E - \\frac{1}{5}E = 20 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{5}{5}E - \\frac{1}{5}E = 20 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{4}{5}E = 20 \\]\n\\[ E = 20 \\times \\frac{5}{4} \\]\n\\[ E = 25 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of apples sold based on the total earnings.**\n\nReginald earns $1.25 for each apple he sells. If he earned $25, the number of apples he sold is:\n\\[ \\frac{25}{1.25} = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of apples Reginald sold is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
        "First, we need to determine the total cost of the repairs. The repairs cost 25% of the bike's cost. The bike costs $80, so the cost of the repairs is:\n\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 80 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Reginald earned before paying for the repairs. After paying for the repairs, 1/5 of the money he earned remains. Let \\( E \\) be the total amount of money Reginald earned. After paying $20 for the repairs, 1/5 of \\( E \\) remains. Therefore, the amount of money he has left after the repairs is:\n\n\\[\nE - 20 = \\frac{1}{5}E\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this equation for \\( E \\). First, we isolate \\( E \\) on one side of the equation by subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{5}E \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\nE - \\frac{1}{5}E = 20\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{5}E - \\frac{1}{5}E = 20\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5}E = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( E \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\nE = 20 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = 25 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo, Reginald earned $25 in total. Since he sells each apple for $1.25, the number of apples he sold is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{25}{1.25} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of apples Reginald sold is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
        "To determine how many apples Reginald sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the repairs.\n2. Determine the total amount of money Reginald earned before paying for the repairs.\n3. Calculate the number of apples sold based on the total earnings.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the repairs.**\n\nThe repairs cost 25% of the bike's cost.
