        "To determine the cost of one pair of jeans, let's break down the total cost of the items Mary bought step by step.\n\nFirst, we know the following:\n- Mary bought a coat for James for $40.\n- Mary bought two pairs of jeans for James, and each pair cost the same price. Let's call the cost of one pair of jeans \\( x \\). Therefore, the cost of two pairs of jeans is \\( 2x \\).\n- Mary bought a pair of shoes for Jamie for $30.\n- The total cost of all the items is $110.\n\nWe can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:\n\\[ 40 + 2x + 30 = 110 \\]\n\nNext, we combine the known costs on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 70 + 2x = 110 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( 2x \\), we subtract 70 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2x = 40 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[ x = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of one pair of jeans is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
