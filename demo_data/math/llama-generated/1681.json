        "To determine how many more flavors Gretchen needs to try this year to have tried all 100 flavors, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of flavors Gretchen tried 2 years ago.\n2. Calculate the number of flavors Gretchen tried last year.\n3. Find the total number of flavors Gretchen has tried so far.\n4. Subtract the total number of flavors tried from the total number of flavors available to find out how many more she needs to try this year.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Gretchen tried \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the flavors 2 years ago. Since there are 100 flavors, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25\n   \\]\n   So, Gretchen tried 25 flavors 2 years ago.\n\n2. Last year, she tried double the amount she tried 2 years ago. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 25 = 50\n   \\]\n   So, Gretchen tried 50 flavors last year.\n\n3. To find the total number of flavors Gretchen has tried so far, we add the flavors she tried 2 years ago and last year:\n   \\[\n   25 + 50 = 75\n   \\]\n   So, Gretchen has tried 75 flavors so far.\n\n4. To find out how many more flavors she needs to try this year to have tried all 100 flavors, we subtract the total number of flavors she has tried from the total number of flavors available:\n   \\[\n   100 - 75 = 25\n   \\]\n   So, Gretchen needs to try 25 more flavors this year.\n\nTherefore, the number of flavors Gretchen needs to try this year is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
