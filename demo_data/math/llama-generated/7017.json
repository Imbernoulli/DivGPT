        "Let's define the number of floors in the Leeward Center as \\( L \\). According to the problem, the Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center, so the number of floors in the Chrysler Building can be expressed as \\( L + 11 \\).\n\nThe total number of floors in both buildings combined is given as 35. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ L + (L + 11) = 35 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 2L + 11 = 35 \\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate \\( L \\) by subtracting 11 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2L = 24 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( L \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ L = 12 \\]\n\nSo, the Leeward Center has 12 floors. Since the Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center, we can find the number of floors in the Chrysler Building by adding 11 to the number of floors in the Leeward Center:\n\n\\[ L + 11 = 12 + 11 = 23 \\]\n\nTherefore, the Chrysler Building has \\(\\boxed{23}\\) floors.",

Since the Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center, we can find the number of floors in the Chrysler Building by adding 11 to the number of floors in the Leeward Center:\n\n\\[ L + 11 = 12 + 11 = 23 \\]\n\nTherefore, the Chrysler Building has \\(\\boxed{23}\\) floors.",
