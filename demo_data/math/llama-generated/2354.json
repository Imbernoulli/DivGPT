Calculate how many pieces she will have left after giving some to her brother.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pieces of beef jerky Janette will consume each day:\n- For breakfast, she eats 1 piece.\n- For lunch, she eats 1 piece.\n- For dinner, she eats 2 pieces.\nSo, each day she eats \\(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\\) pieces.\n\nSince she is camping for 5 days, the total consumption over the trip is:\n\\[4 \\text{ pieces/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 20 \\text{ pieces}\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total consumption from the initial amount of beef jerky:\n\\[40 \\text{ pieces} - 20 \\text{ pieces} = 20 \\text{ pieces}\\]\n\nAfter the trip, Janette plans on giving half of the remaining pieces to her brother. So, we calculate half of the remaining 20 pieces:\n\\[20 \\text{ pieces} \\div 2 = 10 \\text{ pieces}\\]\n\nTherefore, after giving half of the remaining pieces to her brother, Janette will have:\n\\[20 \\text{ pieces} - 10 \\text{ pieces} = 10 \\text{ pieces}\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\\boxed{10}\\]",
