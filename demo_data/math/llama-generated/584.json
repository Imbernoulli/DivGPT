        "To determine the number of whiskers Catman Do has, we start by identifying the number of whiskers Princess Puff has. According to the problem, Princess Puff has 14 whiskers.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of whiskers Catman Do has. The problem states that Catman Do has 6 less than twice the number of whiskers as Princess Puff. We can break this down into two steps:\n\n1. Calculate twice the number of whiskers Princess Puff has.\n2. Subtract 6 from the result obtained in step 1.\n\nFirst, we calculate twice the number of whiskers Princess Puff has:\n\\[ 2 \\times 14 = 28 \\]\n\nThen, we subtract 6 from 28:\n\\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, Catman Do has \\(\\boxed{22}\\) whiskers.",
