        "To determine how many berries Samuel's birds eat in 4 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the daily berry consumption for one bird:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Berries per bird per day} = 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the daily berry consumption for all 5 birds:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Berries for 5 birds per day} = 7 \\times 5 = 35\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total berry consumption for 4 days:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Berries for 5 birds in 4 days} = 35 \\times 4 = 140\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of berries Samuel's birds eat in 4 days is \\boxed{140}.",
        "To determine how many berries Samuel's birds eat in 4 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of berries one bird eats in one day.\n2. Multiply that by the number of birds to find out how many berries all the birds eat in one day.\n3. Multiply the result by the number of days to find out how many berries all the birds eat in 4 days.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Each bird eats 7 berries a day.\n2. Samuel has 5 birds. So, the total number of berries eaten by all the birds in one day is:\n   \\[\n   7 \\text{ berries/bird} \\times 5 \\text{ birds} = 35 \\text{ berries/day}\n   \\]\n3.
