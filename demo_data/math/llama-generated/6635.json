Subtract the cashback from the total cost after initial discounts.\n\nLet's start with the iPhone 12:\n- The original price is $800.\n- The discount is 15%.\n- The discount amount is \\( 800 \\times \\frac{15}{100} = 800 \\times 0.15 = 120 \\).\n- The price after the discount is \\( 800 - 120 = 680 \\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the discount on the iWatch:\n- The original price is $300.\n- The discount is 10%.\n- The discount amount is \\( 300 \\times \\frac{10}{100} = 300 \\times 0.10 = 30 \\).\n- The price after the discount is \\( 300 - 30 = 270 \\).\n\nNow, let's determine the total cost after the initial discounts:\n- The total cost is \\( 680 + 270 = 950 \\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the cashback on the total cost after initial discounts:\n- The cashback is 2%.\n- The cashback amount is \\( 950 \\times \\frac{2}{100} = 950 \\times 0.02 = 19 \\).\n- The total cost after the cashback is \\( 950 - 19 = 931 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the items after the discount and cashback is \\(\\boxed{931}\\).",
