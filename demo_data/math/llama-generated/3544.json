Calculate the total weight of the green weights.\n   - Each green weight weighs 3 pounds.\n   - Harry put 5 green weights on the bar.\n   - Therefore, the total weight of the green weights is \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\) pounds.\n\n3. Add the weight of the bar to the total weight of the weights.\n   - The bar weighs 2 pounds.\n   - The total weight of the weights is \\(8 + 15 = 23\\) pounds.\n   - Therefore, the total weight of Harry's custom creation is \\(23 + 2 = 25\\) pounds.\n\nThe total amount of weight of Harry's custom creation is \\(\\boxed{25}\\) pounds."
