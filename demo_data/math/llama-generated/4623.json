        "To determine Julie's monthly salary given that she was not able to go to work for a day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Julie's weekly earnings.\n2. Determine how many days Julie worked in a week if she missed one day.\n3. Calculate her monthly earnings based on the number of weeks she worked.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Julie's weekly earnings.**\n\nJulie's hourly rate is $5, and she works 8 hours a day. So, her daily earnings are:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 8 \\text{ hours/day} = 40 \\text{ dollars/day} \\]\n\nSince she works 6 days a week, her weekly earnings are:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 6 \\text{ days/week} = 240 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many days Julie worked in a week if she missed one day.**\n\nIf Julie missed one day, she worked:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ days/week} - 1 \\text{ day} = 5 \\text{ days/week} \\]\n\nSo, her earnings for the week she missed one day are:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ dollars/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 200 \\text{ dollars/week} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate her monthly earnings based on the number of weeks she worked.**\n\nAssuming there are 4 weeks in a month, her monthly earnings would be:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ dollars/week} + (4-1) \\times 240 \\text{ dollars/week} = 200 \\text{ dollars/week} + 3 \\times 240 \\text{ dollars/week} = 200 \\text{ dollars/week} + 720 \\text{ dollars/week} = 920 \\text{
