        "To determine how many of Mary's characters have the initial D, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of characters with the initial A:**\n   Mary has 60 characters in total. Half of them have the initial A.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of characters with initial A} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of characters with the initial C:**\n   Half of the characters with the initial A have the initial C.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of characters with initial C} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total number of characters with initials A and C:**\n   Add the number of characters with the initial A and the initial C.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total characters with initials A and C} = 30 + 15 = 45\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of characters with initials D and E:**\n   Subtract the total number of characters with initials A and C from the total number of characters.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total characters with initials D and E} = 60 - 45 = 15\n   \\]\n\n5. **Set up the equation for the number of characters with initials D and E:**\n   Let \\( E \\) be the number of characters with the initial E.
