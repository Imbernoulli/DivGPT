        "To determine how much money Vincent will earn after five days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the price of a literature book.\n2. Determine the daily earnings from selling fantasy books.\n3. Determine the daily earnings from selling literature books.\n4. Calculate the total daily earnings.\n5. Calculate the total earnings over five days.\n\nFirst, we know that the price of a fantasy book is $4. Since a literature book costs half of the price of a fantasy book, we calculate the price of a literature book as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Price of a literature book} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the daily earnings from selling fantasy books. Vincent sells five fantasy books each day, so:\n\\[ \\text{Daily earnings from fantasy books} = 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the daily earnings from selling literature books. Vincent sells eight literature books each day, so:\n\\[ \\text{Daily earnings from literature books} = 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we find the total daily earnings by adding the earnings from fantasy books and literature books:\n\\[ \\text{Total daily earnings} = 20 + 16 = 36 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total earnings over five days:\n\\[ \\text{Total earnings after five days} = 36 \\times 5 = 180 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Vincent will earn after five days is \\(\\boxed{180}\\).",
