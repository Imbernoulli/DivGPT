        "Let's start by determining the initial number of cars the factory planned to produce. The factory initially planned to produce 200 cars. Due to metal shortages, they decreased the production by 50 cars. So, the new production number is:\n\n\\[ 200 - 50 = 150 \\]\n\nNext, due to the pandemic, they had to cut production by another 50%. Therefore, we need to calculate 50% of 150 and subtract it from 150. First, we find 50% of 150:\n\n\\[ 0.50 \\times 150 = 75 \\]\n\nThen, we subtract this value from 150:\n\n\\[ 150 - 75 = 75 \\]\n\nSo, the factory will produce 75 cars.
