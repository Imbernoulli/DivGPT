        "To determine how much Tom spends on gas in 10 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance Tom drives in 10 days.\n2. Determine how many gallons of gas Tom uses for this distance.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the gas used.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Tom drives in 10 days.**\n\nTom drives 75 miles per day. Over 10 days, the total distance is:\n\\[ 75 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 10 \\text{ days} = 750 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many gallons of gas Tom uses for this distance.**\n\nTom's car gets 50 miles per gallon. Therefore, the number of gallons of gas used for 750 miles is:\n\\[ \\frac{750 \\text{ miles}}{50 \\text{ miles/gallon}} = 15 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the gas used.**\n\nThe cost of gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost for 15 gallons is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ gallons} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/gallon} = 45 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the amount Tom spends on gas in 10 days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]",
