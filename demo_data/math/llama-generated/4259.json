        "To determine how many missed field goals went wide right, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of missed field goals.\n2. Determine how many of the missed field goals were wide right.\n\nFirst, we know that Wario misses 1/4 of the field goals. Since he attempts 60 field goals, we can calculate the number of missed field goals as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of missed field goals} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 60 = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that 20 percent of the missed field goals were wide right. Therefore, we need to find 20 percent of 15:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of missed field goals wide right} = 0.20 \\times 15 = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of missed field goals that went wide right is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",
