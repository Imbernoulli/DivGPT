        "To determine the total distance Martin traveled during his eight-hour business trip, we need to break down the trip into two halves and calculate the distance for each half separately.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time spent on each half of the trip. Since the total trip time is 8 hours, the time spent on each half is:\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the distance traveled during the first half of the trip. The speed during the first half is 70 kilometers per hour.
