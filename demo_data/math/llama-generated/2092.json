Since there are 20 gnomes in Westerville woods, we can find the number of gnomes in Ravenswood forest by multiplying 20 by 4:\n\\[\n4 \\times 20 = 80\n\\]\nSo, there are 80 gnomes in Ravenswood forest.\n\nNext, we determine how many gnomes are taken by the forest owner. We know that 40% of the gnomes are taken. To find 40% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.40:\n\\[\n80 \\times 0.40 = 32\n\\]\nSo, 32 gnomes are taken by the forest owner.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of gnomes taken from the total number of gnomes in Ravenswood forest to find out how many gnomes remain:\n\\[\n80 - 32 = 48\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of gnomes that remain in Ravenswood forest is \\boxed{48}.",

Since 40% of the gnomes are taken, we calculate 40% of 80:\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 80 = 32\n\\]\nSo, 32 gnomes are taken for use by the forest owner.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of gnomes taken from the total number of gnomes in Ravenswood forest to find out how many gnomes remain:\n\\[\n80 - 32 = 48\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of gnomes that remain in Ravenswood forest is \\boxed{48}.",
