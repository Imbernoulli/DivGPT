        "To determine how many hotdogs Lisa needs to eat per minute to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of hotdogs Lisa needs to eat to tie the record.\n2. Determine how many hotdogs Lisa has already eaten.\n3. Calculate how many hotdogs Lisa still needs to eat.\n4. Determine the remaining time Lisa has to eat the hotdogs.\n5. Calculate the rate at which Lisa needs to eat hotdogs per minute.\n\nFirst, Joey Chestnut's record is 75 hotdogs. So, Lisa needs to eat 75 hotdogs to tie the record.\n\nNext, we know that halfway through the time (which is 5 minutes), Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs. Therefore, she still needs to eat:\n\\[ 75 - 20 = 55 \\text{ hotdogs} \\]\n\nSince the total time is 10 minutes and she has already eaten for 5 minutes, she has 5 minutes left to eat the remaining hotdogs.

Identify the total number of hotdogs Lisa needs to eat to tie the record.\n2. Determine how many hotdogs Lisa has already eaten.\n3. Calculate how many hotdogs Lisa still needs to eat.\n4. Determine how much time Lisa has left.\n5. Calculate the required hotdogs per minute.\n\nFirst, Joey Chestnut's record is 75 hotdogs. So, Lisa needs to eat 75 hotdogs to tie the record.\n\nNext, we know that halfway through the time Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs. Since the total time is 10 minutes, halfway is 5 minutes. Therefore, in 5 minutes, Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs.\n\nTo find out how many hotdogs Lisa still needs to eat, we subtract the number of hotdogs she has already eaten from the total number of hotdogs required:\n\\[ 75 - 20 = 55 \\]\nSo, Lisa needs to eat 55 more hotdogs.\n\nSince Lisa has 5 minutes left (10 minutes total minus 5 minutes already), we need to determine how many hotdogs she needs to eat per minute. We do this by dividing the number of hotdogs she still needs to eat by the number of minutes left:\n\\[ \\frac{55}{5} = 11 \\]\nSo, Lisa needs to eat 11 hotdogs per minute to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]",

We do this by dividing the number of hotdogs she still needs to eat by the remaining time:\n\\[ \\frac{55}{5} = 11 \\]\nSo, Lisa needs to eat 11 hotdogs per minute to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]",
        "To determine how many hotdogs Lisa needs to eat per minute to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hotdogs Lisa still needs to eat.\n2. Determine the remaining time she has left.\n3. Calculate the rate at which she needs to eat hotdogs per minute.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many hotdogs Lisa still needs to eat. Joey Chestnut's record is 75 hotdogs, and Lisa has already eaten 20 hotdogs. Therefore, the number of hotdogs she still needs to eat is:\n\\[ 75 - 20 = 55 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much time Lisa has left. She has already eaten for 5 minutes out of the 10 minutes, so the remaining time is:\n\\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the rate at which Lisa needs to eat hotdogs per minute. To do this, we divide the number of hotdogs she still needs to eat by the remaining time:\n\\[ \\frac{55}{5} = 11 \\text{ hotdogs per minute} \\]\n\nTherefore, Lisa needs to eat \\(\\boxed{11}\\) hotdogs per minute to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record.",
