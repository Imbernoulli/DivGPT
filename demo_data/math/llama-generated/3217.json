Since each car comes every 20 minutes, the total time for 30 cars is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ cars} \\times 20 \\text{ minutes per car} = 600 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60:\n\\[ 600 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 10 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hours that have passed once 30 cars have come down the road is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "To determine how many hours have passed once 30 cars have come down the road, we start by understanding the frequency of the cars. A car comes down the road every 20 minutes. We need to find out how much time has passed after 30 cars have come down.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total time in minutes that it takes for 30 cars to come down the road. Since each car comes every 20 minutes, we multiply the number of cars by the time interval between each car:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ cars} \\times 20 \\text{ minutes per car} = 600 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we convert the total time from minutes to hours.
