        "Let's define the number of drunk drivers as \\( d \\). According to the problem, the number of speeders is 3 less than 7 times the number of drunk drivers. Therefore, the number of speeders can be expressed as \\( 7d - 3 \\).\n\nThe total number of students in the class is the sum of the number of drunk drivers and the number of speeders. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ d + (7d - 3) = 45 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ d + 7d - 3 = 45 \\]\n\\[ 8d - 3 = 45 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( d \\), we first add 3 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 8d - 3 + 3 = 45 + 3 \\]\n\\[ 8d = 48 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 8:\n\\[ d = \\frac{48}{8} \\]\n\\[ d = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the number of drunk drivers is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
