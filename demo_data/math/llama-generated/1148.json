        "To determine how many bottles of sanitizer gel Danivan Drugstore has at the end of the week, we need to account for the initial inventory, the sales throughout the week, and the delivery on Saturday. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Inventory**: The Drugstore starts with 4500 bottles.\n2. **Sales on Monday**: 2445 bottles are sold.\n3. **Sales on Tuesday**: 900 bottles are sold.\n4. **Sales from Wednesday to Sunday**: 50 bottles are sold each day for 5 days (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).\n5. **Delivery on Saturday**: 650 bottles are delivered.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total sales for the week:\n- Sales on Monday: 2445 bottles\n- Sales on Tuesday: 900 bottles\n- Sales from Wednesday to Sunday: \\(50 \\text{ bottles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 250 \\text{ bottles}\\)\n\nAdding these together gives the total sales for the week:\n\\[2445 + 900 + 250 = 3595 \\text{ bottles}\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total sales from the initial inventory to find out how many bottles are left before the delivery:\n\\[4500 - 3595 = 905 \\text{ bottles}\\]\n\nFinally, we add the delivery of 650 bottles to the remaining inventory:\n\\[905 + 650 = 1555 \\text{ bottles}\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bottles of sanitizer gel the Drugstore has at the end of the week is \\(\\boxed{1555}\\).",
