        "To determine how many cottage pies the school cafeteria made, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of ground mince used for the lasagnas.\n2. Subtract the amount of ground mince used for the lasagnas from the total amount of ground mince used.\n3. Divide the remaining amount of ground mince by the amount used per cottage pie to find the number of cottage pies made.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The cafeteria makes 100 lasagnas, and each lasagna uses 2 pounds of ground mince. Therefore, the total amount of ground mince used for the lasagnas is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ lasagnas} \\times 2 \\text{ pounds/lasagna} = 200 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount of ground mince used for the lasagnas from the total amount of ground mince used. The total amount of ground mince used is 500 pounds. Therefore, the amount of ground mince used for the cottage pies is:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ pounds} - 200 \\text{ pounds} = 300 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nFinally, we divide the remaining amount of ground mince by the amount used per cottage pie to find the number of cottage pies made. Each cottage pie uses 3 pounds of ground mince. Therefore, the number of cottage pies made is:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ pounds} \\div 3 \\text{ pounds/cottage pie} = 100 \\text{ cottage pies} \\]\n\nSo, the number of cottage pies made is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
        "To determine the number of cottage pies the school cafeteria made, we can set up an equation based on the information given.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- Let \\( L \\) be the number of lasagnas.\n- Let \\( C \\) be the number of cottage pies.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- The cafeteria makes 100 lasagnas, so \\( L = 100 \\).\n- Each lasagna uses 2 pounds of ground mince.\n- Each cottage pie uses 3 pounds of ground mince.\n- The total amount of ground mince used is 500 pounds.\n\nThe total amount of ground mince used can be expressed as the sum of the ground mince used for the lasagnas and the ground mince used for the cottage pies:\n\\[ 2L + 3C = 500 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( L = 100 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 2(100) + 3C = 500 \\]\n\\[ 200 + 3C = 500 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( C \\) by subtracting 200 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3C = 500 - 200 \\]\n\\[ 3C = 300 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( C \\) by dividing both sides by 3:\n\\[ C = \\frac{300}{3} \\]\n\\[ C = 100 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cottage pies the cafeteria made is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
