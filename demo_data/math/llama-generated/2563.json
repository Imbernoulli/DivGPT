The game is 880 MB in total, and Mason has already downloaded 310 MB. Therefore, the remaining amount of data to be downloaded is:\n\n\\[ 880 \\text{ MB} - 310 \\text{ MB} = 570 \\text{ MB} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take to download the remaining 570 MB at a speed of 3 MB per minute.
