        "To determine how far John moves horizontally, we need to analyze the relationship between his vertical and horizontal distances. John travels 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally. This means his vertical distance traveled is half of his horizontal distance traveled.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total vertical distance John travels. His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet, so the vertical distance is:\n\\[ 1450 - 100 = 1350 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nSince John travels 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally, the horizontal distance he travels is twice the vertical distance. Therefore, the horizontal distance is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 1350 = 2700 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nSo, the horizontal distance John moves is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2700} \\]",
        "To determine how far John moves horizontally, we need to analyze the ratio of vertical to horizontal movement and the total change in elevation.\n\n1. **Determine the total vertical distance traveled:**\n   John's elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total vertical distance} = 1450 \\text{ feet} - 100 \\text{ feet} = 1350 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understand the ratio of vertical to horizontal movement:**\n   John travels 1 foot vertically for every 2 feet horizontally. This can be expressed as a ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{vertical distance}}{\\text{horizontal distance}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set up the proportion to find the horizontal distance:**\n   Let \\( h \\) be the horizontal distance traveled. According to the ratio, the vertical distance (1350 feet) divided by the horizontal distance (\\( h \\)) should equal \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1350}{h} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( h \\):**\n   To find \\( h \\), we can cross-multiply:\n   \\[\n   1350 \\times 2 = 1 \\times h\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2700 = h\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the horizontal distance John moves is \\(\\boxed{2700}\\) feet.",
