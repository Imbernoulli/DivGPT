Subtract the number of lost baby hawks from the total number of baby hawks born.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pregnancies for all the kettles.\n   - There are 6 kettles.\n   - Each kettle has an average of 15 pregnancies.\n   - Therefore, the total number of pregnancies is \\(6 \\times 15 = 90\\).\n\n2. Determine the total number of baby hawks born from these pregnancies.\n   - Each pregnancy yields 4 babies.\n   - Therefore, the total number of baby hawks born is \\(90 \\times 4 = 360\\).\n\n3. Calculate the number of baby hawks lost.\n   - Approximately 25% of the baby hawks are lost.\n   - Therefore, the number of baby hawks lost is \\(360 \\times 0.25 = 90\\).\n\n4. Subtract the number of lost baby hawks from the total number of baby hawks born.\n   - The number of baby hawks expected is \\(360 - 90 = 270\\).\n\nThus, the expected number of baby hawks this season is \\(\\boxed{270}\\).",

Find the number of baby hawks remaining after the losses.\n\nLet's start with the first step. There are 6 kettles, and each kettle has an average of 15 pregnancies.
