Since Anais has 30 more toys than Kamari, the number of toys Anais has can be expressed as \\( x + 30 \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of toys is 160. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of toys:\n\\[ x + (x + 30) = 160 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 2x + 30 = 160 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2x = 130 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[ x = 65 \\]\n\nSo, Kamari has \\(\\boxed{65}\\) toys.",

        "To determine how many toys are in Kamari's box, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( K \\) as the number of toys in Kamari's box.\n- \\( A \\) as the number of toys in Anais's box.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. Anais has 30 more toys than Kamari.\n2. The total number of toys is 160.\n\nWe can express these two pieces of information as the following equations:\n1. \\( A = K + 30 \\)\n2. \\( A + K = 160 \\)\n\nFirst, we substitute the expression for \\( A \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[ (K + 30) + K = 160 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms:\n\\[ 2K + 30 = 160 \\]\n\nThen, we isolate \\( K \\) by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2K = 130 \\]\n\nFinally, we solve for \\( K \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ K = 65 \\]\n\nSo, the number of toys in Kamari's box is \\(\\boxed{65}\\).\n\nTo verify, we can find the number of toys in Anais's box:\n\\[ A = K + 30 = 65 + 30 = 95 \\]\n\nThen, we check the total number of toys:\n\\[ A + K = 95 + 65 = 160 \\]\n\nThe total is correct, confirming that our solution is accurate. Therefore, the number of toys in Kamari's box is \\(\\boxed{65}\\)."
