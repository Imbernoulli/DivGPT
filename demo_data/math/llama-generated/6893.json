Since Jake earns thrice what Jacob does, we can calculate Jake's hourly wage as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Jake's hourly wage} = 3 \\times \\text{Jacob's hourly wage} = 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\text{ dollars per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate Jake's daily earnings. Jake works 8 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:\n\\[\n\\text{Jake's daily earnings} = \\text{Jake's hourly wage} \\times \\text{hours worked per day} = 18 \\times 8 = 144 \\text{ dollars per day}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate Jake's earnings over 5 days. Since Jake earns $144 per day, his earnings over 5 days are:\n\\[\n\\text{Jake's earnings over 5 days} = \\text{Jake's daily earnings} \\times \\text{days worked} = 144 \\times 5 = 720 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, Jake earns \\(\\boxed{720}\\) dollars in 5 days working 8 hours a day.",
        "To determine how much Jake earns in 5 days working 8 hours a day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Jacob's hourly wage.\n2.
