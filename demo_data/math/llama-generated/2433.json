        "To determine how many more pins in total Richard knocked down than Patrick, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate the pins knocked down by each person in each round.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many pins Richard knocked down in the first round. Patrick knocked down 70 pins, and Richard knocked down 15 more pins than Patrick:\n\\[\n70 + 15 = 85\n\\]\nSo, Richard knocked down 85 pins in the first round.\n\nNext, let's find out how many pins Patrick knocked down in the second round. Patrick knocked down twice as many pins as Richard did in the first round:\n\\[\n2 \\times 85 = 170\n\\]\nSo, Patrick knocked down 170 pins in the second round.\n\nNow, let's find out how many pins Richard knocked down in the second round. Richard knocked down 3 less than Patrick did in the second round:\n\\[\n170 - 3 = 167\n\\]\nSo, Richard knocked down 167 pins in the second round.\n\nNow, we sum up the pins knocked down by each person in both rounds. First, we calculate the total number of pins knocked down by Patrick:\n\\[\n70 + 170 = 240\n\\]\nSo, Patrick knocked down a total of 240 pins.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of pins knocked down by Richard:\n\\[\n85 + 167 = 252\n\\]\nSo, Richard knocked down a total of 252 pins.\n\nFinally, we find out how many more pins Richard knocked down than Patrick by subtracting the total number of pins knocked down by Patrick from the total number of pins knocked down by Richard:\n\\[\n252 - 240 = 12\n\\]\nSo, Richard knocked down \\(\\boxed{12}\\) more pins in total than Patrick.",
