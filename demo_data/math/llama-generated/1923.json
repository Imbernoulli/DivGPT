        "To determine the total number of days the duck is flying during these seasons, we need to calculate the time it takes for each journey and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's find out how long it takes for the duck to fly to the north during summer. The problem states that it takes twice as much time to fly to the north as it does to fly to the south. Since it takes 40 days to fly to the south, the time to fly to the north is:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ days} \\times 2 = 80 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNext, we know that it takes 60 days to fly to the east during spring.\n\nNow, we sum the times for all three journeys:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ days} \\text{ (south)} + 80 \\text{ days} \\text{ (north)} + 60 \\text{ days} \\text{ (east)} = 180 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of days the duck is flying during these seasons is:\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of days the duck is flying during the different seasons, we need to calculate the time it takes to fly in each direction and then sum these times.\n\n1. The duck takes 40 days to fly to the south during winter.\n2. The duck takes twice as much time to fly to the north during summer. Therefore, the time taken to fly to the north is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 40 = 80 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n3. The duck takes 60 days to travel to the east during spring.\n\nNow, we sum the times for all three directions:\n\\[\n40 + 80 + 60 = 180 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of days the duck is flying during these seasons is \\(\\boxed{180}\\).",
