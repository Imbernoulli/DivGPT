        "To determine how many kilograms of sugar the store sells every week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of sugar sold in grams.\n2. Convert the weight from grams to kilograms.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of sugar sold in grams. The store sells 20 packets of sugar, and each packet weighs 100 grams. So, we multiply the number of packets by the weight of each packet:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ packets} \\times 100 \\text{ grams/packet} = 2000 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the weight from grams to kilograms. There are 1000 grams in a kilogram. So, we divide the total weight in grams by 1000:\n\\[ 2000 \\text{ grams} \\div 1000 = 2 \\text{ kilograms} \\]\n\nTherefore, the store sells \\(\\boxed{2}\\) kilograms of sugar every week.",

Since there are 1000 grams in a kilogram, we divide the total weight in grams by 1000:\n\\[ 2000 \\text{ grams} \\div 1000 = 2 \\text{ kilograms} \\]\n\nSo, the store sells \\(\\boxed{2}\\) kilograms of sugar every week.",
        "To determine how many kilograms of sugar the store sells every week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the amount of sugar per packet**: Each packet contains 100 grams of sugar.\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of sugar sold in grams**: The store sells 20 packets each week. Therefore, we multiply the number of packets by the amount of sugar per packet:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ packets} \\times 100 \\text{ grams/packet} = 2000 \\text{ grams}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert grams to kilograms**: There are 1000 grams in a kilogram. To convert grams to kilograms, we divide the total grams by 1000:\n   \\[\n   2000 \\text{ grams} \\div 1000 = 2 \\text{ kilograms}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the store sells \\(\\boxed{2}\\) kilograms of sugar every week.",
