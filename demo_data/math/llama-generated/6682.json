On a particular day, he counted 100 tents in the northernmost part of the campsite and twice that number on the east side of the grounds. The number of tents at the center of the camp was four times the number of tents in the northernmost part of the campsite. If he also counted 200 tents in the southern part of the campsite, what is the total number of tents in the recreation area?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
