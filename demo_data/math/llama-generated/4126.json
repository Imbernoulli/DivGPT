        "To determine how many times the quarterback is sacked for a loss in the game, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of times the quarterback does not get a pass thrown.\n2. Determine how many of those times result in a sack.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of times the quarterback does not get a pass thrown.**\n\nThe quarterback steps back to throw the ball 80 times. According to the problem, 30 percent of the time he does not get a pass thrown. Therefore, we can calculate this as follows:\n\\[ 80 \\times 0.30 = 24 \\]\nSo, the quarterback does not get a pass thrown 24 times.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many of those times result in a sack.**\n\nHalf of the times that the quarterback does not throw the ball, he is sacked for a loss. Therefore, we can calculate this as follows:\n\\[ 24 \\times 0.50 = 12 \\]\nSo, the quarterback is sacked for a loss 12 times.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]",
