        "To determine the total number of students in both Elementary School and Middle School, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of students in Middle School.\n2. Use the given relationship to find the number of students in Elementary School.\n3. Add the number of students in both schools to get the total.\n\nFirst, we know that the number of students in Middle School is 50. Let's denote this number as \\( M \\). So, \\( M = 50 \\).\n\n According to the problem, the number of students in Elementary School is three less than four times the number of students in Middle School. Let's denote the number of students in Elementary School as \\( E \\). Therefore, we can express \\( E \\) as:\n\\[ E = 4M - 3 \\]\n\nNow, substitute the value of \\( M \\) into the equation:\n\\[ E = 4 \\times 50 - 3 \\]\n\\[ E = 200 - 3 \\]\n\\[ E = 197 \\]\n\nSo, the number of students in Elementary School is 197.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of students in both schools. This is simply the sum of the number of students in Middle School and the number of students in Elementary School:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of students} = M + E \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total number of students} = 50 + 197 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total number of students} = 247 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students in both levels is \\(\\boxed{247}\\).",
