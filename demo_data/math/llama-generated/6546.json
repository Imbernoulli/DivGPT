        "To determine the speed of the fifth rollercoaster, we start by using the information given about the speeds of the first four rollercoasters and the average speed for all five rollercoasters.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total speed of the first four rollercoasters:\n\\[\n50 + 62 + 73 + 70\n\\]\n\nAdding these values step by step:\n\\[\n50 + 62 = 112\n\\]\n\\[\n112 + 73 = 185\n\\]\n\\[\n185 + 70 = 255\n\\]\n\nSo, the total speed of the first four rollercoasters is 255 miles per hour.\n\nNext, we know the average speed for all five rollercoasters is 59 miles per hour.

        "To determine the speed of the fifth rollercoaster, we start by calculating the total speed of all five rollercoasters combined. We know the average speed for all five rollercoasters is 59 miles per hour. The formula for the average speed is the total speed divided by the number of rollercoasters.

The speeds are 50 miles per hour, 62 miles per hour, 73 miles per hour, and 70 miles per hour. We add these speeds together:\n\n\\[\n50 + 62 + 73 + 70 = 255\n\\]\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the speed of the fifth rollercoaster. The total speed of all five rollercoasters is the sum of the speeds of the first four rollercoasters plus the speed of the fifth rollercoaster:\n\n\\[\n295 = 255 + x\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 255 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = 295 - 255 = 40\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the speed of the fifth rollercoaster is \\(\\boxed{40}\\) miles per hour.",
