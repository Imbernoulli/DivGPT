        "To determine the total number of games played by Ken, Dave, and Jerry, we need to find out how many games each of them won based on the given information.\n\nFirst, we know that Jerry won 7 games. Let's denote the number of games Jerry won as \\( J \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ J = 7 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Dave won 3 more games than Jerry. So, the number of games Dave won, which we can denote as \\( D \\), is:\n\\[ D = J + 3 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( J \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ D = 7 + 3 = 10 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Ken won 5 more games than Dave. So, the number of games Ken won, which we can denote as \\( K \\), is:\n\\[ K = D + 5 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( D \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ K = 10 + 5 = 15 \\]\n\nNow, to find the total number of games played, we add the number of games won by Ken, Dave, and Jerry:\n\\[ K + D + J = 15 + 10 + 7 = 32 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of games they played is:\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]",
