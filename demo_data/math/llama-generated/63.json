        "To determine how much money Penny makes from selling 7 cheesecake pies, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of slices per pie:**\n   Each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 slices.\n\n2. **Determine the total number of slices for 7 pies:**\n   If each pie has 6 slices, then for 7 pies:\n   \\[\n   7 \\text{ pies} \\times 6 \\text{ slices per pie} = 42 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 42 slices:**\n   Each slice is sold for $7. Therefore, the total revenue from 42 slices is:\n   \\[\n   42 \\text{ slices} \\times 7 \\text{ dollars per slice} = 294 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Penny makes from selling 7 cheesecake pies is \\(\\boxed{294}\\).",
        "To determine how much money Penny makes from selling 7 cheesecake pies, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of slices from 7 cheesecake pies.\n2. Determine the total revenue by multiplying the total number of slices by the price per slice.\n\nFirst, we find out how many slices are in 7 cheesecake pies. Since each cheesecake pie is cut into 6 slices, we multiply the number of pies by the number of slices per pie:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ pies} \\times 6 \\text{ slices per pie} = 42 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue by multiplying the total number of slices by the price per slice. Each slice costs $7, so we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice:\n\\[ 42 \\text{ slices} \\times 7 \\text{ dollars per slice} = 294 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Penny makes is \\(\\boxed{294}\\).",
