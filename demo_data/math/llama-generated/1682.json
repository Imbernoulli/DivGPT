        "To determine how much Cody paid, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the items including taxes.\n2. Apply the discount to the total cost after taxes.\n3. Divide the final cost by 2, since Cody and his friend split the cost equally.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The original cost of the items is $40, and the tax rate is 5%. The tax amount is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Tax} = 40 \\times \\frac{5}{100} = 40 \\times 0.05 = 2\n\\]\nSo, the total cost after taxes is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost after taxes} = 40 + 2 = 42\n\\]\n\nNext, we apply the $8 discount to the total cost after taxes:\n\\[\n\\text{Final cost after discount} = 42 - 8 = 34\n\\]\n\nFinally, Cody and his friend split the final cost equally. Therefore, Cody's share is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cody's share} = \\frac{34}{2} = 17\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount Cody paid is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{17}\n\\]",
        "To determine how much Cody paid, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the items before tax.\n2. Add the tax to the total cost.\n3.

The total cost of the items before tax is $40.\n\n2. The tax is 5%. To find the amount of tax, we multiply $40 by 5% (or 0.05):\n   \\[\n   40 \\times 0.05 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost after tax is:\n   \\[\n   40 + 2 = 42\n   \\]\n\n3. Cody gets an $8 discount. So, we subtract $8 from the total cost after tax:\n   \\[\n   42 - 8 = 34\n   \\]\n\n4. Cody and his friend split the final price equally. So, we divide $34 by 2:\n   \\[\n   34 \\div 2 = 17\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Cody paid \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",

Therefore, the tax amount is:\n   \\[\n   40 \\times \\frac{5}{100} = 40 \\times 0.05 = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the tax to the original purchase amount to get the total before the discount:**\n   The original purchase amount is $40, and the tax is $2. Therefore, the total before the discount is:\n   \\[\n   40 + 2 = 42\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the discount from the total before the discount to get the final price:**\n   The total before the discount is $42, and the discount is $8. Therefore, the final price is:\n   \\[\n   42 - 8 = 34\n   \\]\n\n4. **Divide the final price by 2 to find out how much Cody paid:**\n   The final price is $34, and Cody and his friend split it equally.

Therefore, Cody pays half of the final cost:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cody's share} = \\frac{34}{2} = 17 \\]\n\nSo, Cody paid \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",
        "To determine how much Cody paid, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost after adding the taxes.\n2. Apply the discount to the total cost after taxes.\n3. Divide the final cost by 2 to find out how much Cody paid.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The original cost of the items Cody bought is $40. The tax rate is 5%, so we need to calculate the tax amount:\n\\[\n\\text{Tax amount} = 40 \\times \\frac{5}{100} = 40 \\times 0.05 = 2\n\\]\nAdding the tax to the original cost gives us the total cost before the discount:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost before discount} = 40 + 2 = 42\n\\]\nNext, we apply the $8 discount to the total cost before the discount:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost after discount} = 42 - 8 = 34\n\\]\nFinally, since Cody and his friend split the final price equally, we divide the total cost after the discount by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount Cody paid} = \\frac{34}{2} = 17\n\\]\nTherefore, the amount Cody paid is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{17}\n\\]",
