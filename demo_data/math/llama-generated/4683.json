        "Let's define the number of boxes Sally sold on Saturday as \\( x \\). According to the problem, she sold 50% more boxes on Sunday than she did on Saturday. Therefore, the number of boxes she sold on Sunday is \\( x + 0.5x = 1.5x \\).\n\nThe total number of boxes sold over the two days is the sum of the boxes sold on Saturday and Sunday.

This means that on Sunday, she sold \\( x + 0.5x = 1.5x \\) boxes.\n\nThe total number of boxes sold on both Saturday and Sunday is given as 150. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ x + 1.5x = 150 \\]\n\nCombining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 2.5x = 150 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.5:\n\\[ x = \\frac{150}{2.5} \\]\n\nPerforming the division, we get:\n\\[ x = 60 \\]\n\nSo, the number of boxes Sally sold on Saturday is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).\n\nTo verify, we can check the number of boxes sold on Sunday and the total sold over the two days. If Sally sold 60 boxes on Saturday, then on Sunday she sold \\( 1.5 \\times 60 = 90 \\) boxes. The total number of boxes sold is \\( 60 + 90 = 150 \\), which matches the information given in the problem. Therefore, the solution is correct.",

        "Let's denote the number of boxes Sally sold on Saturday as \\( x \\). According to the problem, on Sunday she sold 50% more boxes than she sold on Saturday. Therefore, the number of boxes she sold on Sunday is \\( x + 0.5x = 1.5x \\).\n\nThe total number of boxes sold over the two days is the sum of the boxes sold on Saturday and the boxes sold on Sunday. This gives us the equation:\n\\[\nx + 1.5x = 150\n\\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[\n2.5x = 150\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2.5:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{150}{2.5} = 60\n\\]\nSo, the number of boxes Sally sold on Saturday is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
