        "To determine the total number of hours Mike will practice from now until the next game, we need to break down his practice schedule and calculate the hours for each day over the 3 weeks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of hours Mike practices in one week:\n- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), he practices for 3 hours each day. There are 5 weekdays in a week.\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 15 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n- On Saturdays, he practices for 5 hours.\n  \\[\n  5 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n- On Sundays, he takes the day off, so he practices 0 hours.\n\nAdding these together gives the total practice hours for one week:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ hours} + 5 \\text{ hours} + 0 \\text{ hours} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours he practices over 3 weeks:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 60 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Mike will practice from now until the next game is \\boxed{60}.",
        "To determine the total number of hours Mike will practice from now until the next game, we need to break down his practice schedule over the 3 weeks. Let's calculate the number of hours he practices in one week first.\n\nMike practices for 3 hours each weekday (Monday through Friday), so in one week he practices:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 15 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nOn Saturdays, he practices for 5 hours, so in one week he practices:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nOn Sundays, he takes a break, so he practices for 0 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours Mike practices in one week is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ hours} + 5 \\text{ hours} + 0 \\text{ hours} = 20 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nSince the team has a game in 3 weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he practices in one week by 3:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 3 \\text{ weeks} = 60 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Mike will practice from now until the next game is:\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of hours Mike will practice before his next game, we need to calculate his weekly practice hours and then multiply by the number of weeks until the game.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Mike's practice hours for one week.
