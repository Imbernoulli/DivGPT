        "To determine how much money Jane will make in 2 weeks from selling all her eggs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the chickens in one week.\n2. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the chickens in two weeks.\n3. Determine the total revenue from selling the eggs in two weeks.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the chickens in one week.**\n\nJane has 10 chickens, and each chicken lays 6 eggs per week.\n\\[\n10 \\text{ chickens} \\times 6 \\text{ eggs/chicken/week} = 60 \\text{ eggs/week}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the chickens in two weeks.**\n\nSince the chickens lay 60 eggs per week, in two weeks they will lay:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ eggs/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 120 \\text{ eggs}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total revenue from selling the eggs in two weeks.**\n\nJane sells the eggs for $2 per dozen. First, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens:\n\\[\n120 \\text{ eggs} \\div 12 \\text{ eggs/dozen} = 10 \\text{ dozens}\n\\]\nThen, we calculate the revenue from selling 10 dozens of eggs:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ dozens} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/dozen} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Jane will make in 2 weeks if she sells all her eggs is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]"
