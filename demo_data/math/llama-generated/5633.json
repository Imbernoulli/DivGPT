        "To determine how much Chastity was left with after buying the candies, we need to calculate the total cost of the lollipops and gummies and then subtract that total from the amount of money she initially had.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of the lollipops. Chastity bought 4 lollipops, and each lollipop costs $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the lollipops is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 1.50 = 6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the gummies. Chastity bought 2 packs of gummies, and each pack costs $2. Therefore, the total cost of the gummies is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the lollipops and the cost of the gummies to find the total amount spent on the candies:\n\\[ 6 + 4 = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nChastity initially had $15. After spending $10 on the candies, the amount of money she was left with is:\n\\[ 15 - 10 = 5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Chastity was left with after spending on the candies is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]",
