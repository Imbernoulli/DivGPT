        "To determine the percentage of time Haley spent watching the comet, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time Haley spent on all activities.\n2. Determine the time spent watching the comet.\n3. Calculate the percentage of the total time spent watching the comet.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time spent on all activities. Haley spent two hours shopping for a telescope, half an hour getting everything set up in the backyard, three times the setup time making snacks, and 20 minutes watching the comet. We need to convert all times to the same unit, which we will use minutes.\n\n- Two hours shopping for a telescope is \\(2 \\times 60 = 120\\) minutes.\n- Half an hour getting everything set up in the backyard is \\(0.5 \\times 60 = 30\\) minutes.\n- Three times the setup time making snacks is \\(3 \\times 30 = 90\\) minutes.\n-에서는 the time watching the comet is 20 minutes.\n\nAdding these times together gives:\n\\[120 + 30 + 90 + 20 = 260 \\text{ minutes}\\]\n\nNext, we know that Haley spent 20 minutes watching the comet. To find the percentage of the total time spent watching the comet, we use the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Time spent watching the comet}}{\\text{Total time spent on all activities}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{20}{260} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{260} = \\frac{1}{13}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the percentage:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{13} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 7.6923\n\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest percent, we get:\n\\[\n7.6923 \\approx 8\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the total time Haley spent on all those activities that was spent watching the comet is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 2 hours to minutes:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, convert the setup time to minutes:\n\\[ 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 0.5 \\times 60 = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThe time spent making snacks is three times the setup time:\n\\[ 3 \\times 30 = 90 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThe time spent watching the comet is already given in minutes:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, add up all the times:\n\\[ 120 + 30 + 90 + 20 = 260 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, the total time spent on all activities is 260 minutes.\n\nNext, we determine the time spent watching the comet, which is 20 minutes.\n\nTo find the percentage of the total time spent watching the comet, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Time spent watching the comet}}{\\text{Total time spent on all activities}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{20}{260} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{20 \\times 100}{260} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{2000}{260} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{100}{13} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} \\approx 7.6923 \\]\n\nRounding 7.6923 to the nearest percent, we get:\n\\[ 8\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the total time Haley spent on all those activities that was spent watching the comet is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 20 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: \\(20 \\div 60 = \\frac{1}{3}\\) hours.\n\nNow, we sum up all the times:\n\\[\n2 + 0.5 + 1.5 + \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 2, 0.5, 1.5, and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) is 6. We convert each time to a fraction with a denominator of 6:\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{12}{6}, \\quad 0.5 = \\frac{3}{6}, \\quad 1.5 = \\frac{9}{6}, \\quad \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{6}\n\\]\n\nNow we add the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{6} + \\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{9}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{12 + 3 + 9 + 2}{6} = \\frac{26}{6} = \\frac{13}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the total time spent on all the activities is \\(\\frac{13}{3}\\) hours. Next, we need to find out what percentage of this total time was spent watching the comet. The time spent watching the comet is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) hours. The percentage is calculated by dividing the time spent watching the comet by the total time and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{13}{3}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{13} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{1}{13} \\right) \\times 100 = \\frac{100}{13} \\approx 7.6923\n\\]\n\nRounding 7.6923 to the nearest percent, we get 8.

        "To determine what percentage of the total time Haley spent watching the comet, we need to calculate the total time she spent on all activities and then find out what fraction of that time was spent watching the comet.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time spent on each activity:\n- shopping for a telescope: 2 hours\n- getting everything set up in the backyard: 0.5 hours\n- making snacks: 3 times the setup time, which is \\(3 \\times 0.5 = 1.5\\) hours\n- watching the comet: 20 minutes, which is \\(\\frac{20}{60} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) hours\n\nNext, we sum up all the times:\n\\[\n2 + 0.5 + 1.5 + \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo add these times together, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1 and 3 is 3, so we convert the other times to fractions with a denominator of 3:\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{6}{3}, \\quad 0.5 = \\frac{1.5}{3}, \\quad 1.5 = \\frac{4.5}{3}, \\quad \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nNow we can add them up:\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{3} + \\frac{1.5}{3} + \\frac{4.5}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{6 + 1.5 + 4.5 + 1}{3} = \\frac{13}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the total time spent on all activities is \\(\\frac{13}{3}\\) hours. The time spent watching the comet is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) hours. To find out what percentage of the total time was spent watching the comet, we use the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Time spent watching the comet}}{\\text{Total time spent}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{13}{3}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{1}{13} \\right) \\times 100 = \\frac{100}{13} \\approx 7.6923\n\\]\n\nRounding 7.6923 to the nearest percent, we get 8.

        "To determine the percentage of time Haley spent watching the comet, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on all activities.
