        "To determine the total number of trees the forester has planted, we need to follow the steps one by one.\n\n1. **Initial number of trees**: The forest starts with 30 native trees.\n2. **PublicKey on Monday**: The forester triples the number of total trees in the forest by planting new trees. So, the number of trees after Monday is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\times 3 = 90\n   \\]\n   This means the forester planted:\n   \\[\n   90 - 30 = 60\n   \\]\n   trees on Monday.\n3. **Public on Tuesday**: The forester plants a third of the amount he planted on Monday. So, the number of trees planted on Tuesday is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n4. **Total number of trees planted**: The total number of trees planted by the forester is the sum of the trees planted on Monday and Tuesday:\n   \\[\n   60 + 20 = 80\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of trees the forester has planted is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of trees the forester has planted, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of trees planted on Monday:**\n   - Initially, there are 30 native trees.\n   - On Monday, the forester triples the number of total trees.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of new trees planted on Monday.\n   - Therefore, \\( 30 + x = 3 \\times 30 \\).\n\n   Solving for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   30 + x = 90\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 90 - 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 60\n   \\]\n\n   So, the forester planted 60 trees on Monday.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of trees planted on Tuesday:**\n   - On Tuesday, the forester plants a third of the amount he planted on Monday.\n   - Let \\( y \\) be the number of new trees planted on Tuesday.\n   - Therefore, \\( y = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 \\).\n\n   Solving for \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{60}{3}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 20\n   \\]\n\n   So, the forester planted 20 trees on Tuesday.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:**\n   - The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted on Monday and Tuesday.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total trees planted} = 60 + 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total trees planted} = 80\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of trees the forester has planted is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
