        "To determine how much money Tina makes, we need to calculate her earnings for each day and then sum them up for the entire week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate her daily earnings. Tina works 10 hours each day, which is 2 hours more than the standard 8-hour shift. Therefore, she is eligible for overtime for these additional 2 hours.\n\nThe hourly wage for regular work is $18.00, and the hourly wage for overtime is $18.00 + $9.00 (which is half of $18.00). So, the overtime wage is $27.00 per hour.\n\nNow, let's calculate her daily earnings:\n- For the regular 8 hours, she earns $18.00 per hour.\n- For the 2 hours of overtime, she earns $27.00 per hour.\n\nThe earnings for the regular 8 hours are:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$18.00/\\text{hour} = \\$144.00 \\]\n\nThe earnings for the 2 hours of overtime are:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$27.00/\\text{hour} = \\$54.00 \\]\n\nAdding these together gives her total daily earnings:\n\\[ \\$144.00 + \\$54.00 = \\$198.00 \\]\n\nSince Tina works 5 days in a week, her total earnings for the week are:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ days} \\times \\$198.00/\\text{day} = \\$990.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Tina makes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{990} \\]",

So, her daily pay is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$18.00/\\text{hour} + 2 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$27.00/\\text{hour} = \\$144.00 + \\$54.00 = \\$198.00\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much she pays for the entire week. Since she works 5 days a week, her total pay for the week is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ days} \\times \\$198.00/\\text{day} = \\$990.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Tina makes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{990}\n\\]",

So, her daily earnings are:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ regular hours} \\times \\$18.00/\\text{hour} + 2 \\text{ overtime hours} \\times \\$27.00/\\text{hour} = 144 + 54 = \\$198 \\]\n\nSince Tina works 5 days, her total earnings for the week are:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ days} \\times \\$198/\\text{day} = \\$990 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Tina makes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{990} \\]",
        "To determine how much money Tina makes, we need to calculate her earnings for both regular and overtime hours over the 5 days she works.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many regular hours and overtime hours Tina works each day:\n- Tina works 10 hours each day.\n- Regular hours are up to 8 hours per shift.\n- Overtime hours are any hours worked beyond 8 hours.\n\nSo, for each day:\n\\[\n\\text{Regular hours} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Overtime hours} = 10 \\text{ hours} - 8 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the daily earnings for regular hours:\n\\[\n\\text{Regular earnings per day} = \\text{Regular hours} \\times \\text{Hourly wage} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$18.00/\\text{hour} = \\$144.00\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the daily earnings for overtime hours. Overtime pay is hourly wage plus half of the hourly wage:\n\\[\n\\text{Overtime hourly wage} = \\text{Hourly wage} + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Hourly wage} = \\$18.00 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\$18.00 = \\$18.00 + \\$9.00 = \\$27.00\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Overtime earnings per day} = \\text{Overtime hours} \\times \\text{Overtime hourly wage} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$27.00/\\text{hour} = \\$54.00\n\\]\n\nThen, we find the total daily earnings by adding regular earnings and overtime earnings:\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings per day} = \\text{Regular earnings per day} + \\text{Overtime earnings per day} = \\$144.00 + \\$54.00 = \\$198.00\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total earnings for 5 days:\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings for 5 days} = \\text{Total earnings per day} \\times 5 = \\$198.00 \\times 5 = \\$990.00\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Tina makes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{990}\n\\]",
        "To determine how much money Tina makes, we need to calculate her regular pay and her overtime pay separately, and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate her regular pay.

Tina works 10 hours per day for 5 days, which means she works 2 hours of overtime per day (since 10 hours minus 8 hours is 2 hours). Therefore, her total overtime hours are:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 10 \\text{ hours} \\]\nOvertime pay is calculated by her hourly wage plus half of her hourly wage, which is:\n\\[ \\$18.00 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\$18.00 = \\$18.00 + \\$9.00 = \\$27.00/\\text{hour} \\]\nHer total overtime pay is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$27.00/\\text{hour} = \\$270.00 \\]\n\nFinally, we sum her regular pay and her overtime pay to find her total earnings:\n\\[ \\$720.00 + \\$270.00 = \\$990.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Tina makes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{990} \\]",
