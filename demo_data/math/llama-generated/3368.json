        "To find Karl's total income from selling the clothing, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of item and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the revenue from the T-shirts:\nKarl sold 2 T-shirts, and each T-shirt costs $5.\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\nSo, the revenue from the T-shirts is $10.\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from the pants:\nKarl sold 1 pair of pants, and each pair costs $4.\n\\[ 1 \\times 4 = 4 \\]\nSo, the revenue from the pants is $4.\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from the skirts:\nKarl sold 4 skirts, and each skirt costs $6.\n\\[ 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\]\nSo, the revenue from the skirts is $24.\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from the refurbished T-shirts:\nKarl sold 6 refurbished T-shirts, and each refurbished T-shirt costs half the original price of a T-shirt. Since the original price of a T-shirt is $5, the price of a refurbished T-shirt is:\n\\[ \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \\]\nSo, the revenue from the refurbished T-shirts is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 2.5 = 15 \\]\nSo, the revenue from the refurbished T-shirts is $15.\n\nFinally, let's sum the revenues from all the items:\n\\[ 10 + 4 + 24 + 15 = 53 \\]\nSo, Karl's total income is \\(\\boxed{53}\\).",
