        "To determine the total number of goals scored by Gina and Tom over the two days, we need to calculate the goals scored each day by both Gina and Tom and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many goals Tom scored on the first day. We know that Gina scored 2 goals on the first day, which was three less than Tom. Therefore, Tom scored:\n\\[2 + 3 = 5\\]\ngoals on the first day.\n\nNext, let's find out how many goals Gina scored on the second day. We know that Tom scored 6 goals on the second day and Gina scored two goals less than Tom. Therefore, Gina scored:\n\\[6 - 2 = 4\\]\ngoals on the second day.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by Gina over the two days. Gina scored 2 goals on the first day and 4 goals on the second day, so her total is:\n\\[2 + 4 = 6\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by Tom over the two days. Tom scored 5 goals on the first day and 6 goals on the second day, so his total is:\n\\[5 + 6 = 11\\]\n\nFinally, let's find the total number of goals scored by both Gina and Tom over the two days. We add Gina's total and Tom's total:\n\\[6 + 11 = 17\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of goals scored by Gina and Tom during these two days is:\n\\[\\boxed{17}\\]",
