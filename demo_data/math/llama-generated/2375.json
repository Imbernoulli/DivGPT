        "To determine how much money John made from fixing and-League the racecar, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of fixing the racecar after the discount.\n2. Determine how much John keeps after winning the race.\n3. Subtract the cost of fixing the car from the amount John keeps to find out how much he made.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of fixing the racecar after the discount.**\n\nThe original cost to fix the racecar is $20,000. John gets a 20% discount. First, we calculate the amount of the discount:\n\\[ 20,000 \\times 0.20 = 4,000 \\]\n\nSubtract the discount from the original cost to find the discounted cost:\n\\[ 20,000 - 4,000 = 16,000 \\]\n\nSo, the cost to fix the racecar after the discount is $16,000.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much John keeps after winning the race.**\n\nJohn wins a prize of $70,000 but keeps only 90% of it. First, we calculate the amount John keeps:\n\\[ 70,000 \\times 0.90 = 63,000 \\]\n\nSo, John keeps $63,000 after winning the race.\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the cost of fixing the car from the amount John keeps to find out how much he made.**\n\nSubtract the cost of fixing the car from the amount John keeps:\n\\[ 63,000 - 16,000 = 47,000 \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money John made from the car is \\(\\boxed{47000}\\).",

Subtract the cost of fixing the car from the amount of money John keeps.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of fixing the racecar after the discount. The original cost is $20,000 and he gets a 20% discount. So, the discount amount is:\n\\[ 20,000 \\times 0.20 = 4,000 \\]\nSubtracting the discount from the original cost gives:\n\\[ 20,000 - 4,000 = 16,000 \\]\nSo, the cost of fixing the car is $16,000.\n\nNext, let's determine how much money John keeps after winning the race. The prize is $70,000 and he keeps 90% of it. So, the amount he keeps is:\n\\[ 70,000 \\times 0.90 = 63,000 \\]\nSo, John keeps $63,000.\n\nFinally, we subtract the cost of fixing the car from the amount of money John keeps to find out how much money he made from the car:\n\\[ 63,000 - 16,000 = 47,000 \\]\nSo, the amount of money John made from the car is:\n\\[ \\boxed{47000} \\]"
