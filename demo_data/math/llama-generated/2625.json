Subtract the number of drawings made using colored pencils and blending markers from the total number of drawings to find the number of drawings made with charcoal.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- Total number of drawings: 25\n- Number of drawings made using colored pencils: 14\n- Number of drawings made using blending markers: 7\n\nFirst, we add the number of drawings made using colored pencils and blending markers:\n\\[ 14 + 7 = 21 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract this sum from the total number of drawings to find the number of drawings made with charcoal:\n\\[ 25 - 21 = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of charcoal drawings is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
