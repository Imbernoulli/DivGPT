        "To determine how many hot dog buns each of Mr. Gates' students can get, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hot dog buns Mr. Gates bought.\n2. Determine the total number of students.\n3. Divide the total number of hot dog buns by the total number of students.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hot dog buns Mr. Gates bought.**\n\nMr. Gates bought 30 packages of hot dog buns, and each package contains 8 buns. Therefore, the total number of hot dog buns is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ packages} \\times 8 \\text{ buns per package} = 240 \\text{ buns} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of students.**\n\nMr. Gates has four classes, and each class has 30 students. Therefore, the total number of students is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ classes} \\times 30 \\text{ students per class} = 120 \\text{ students} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Divide the total number of hot dog buns by the total number of students.**\n\nTo find out how many hot dog buns each student can get, we divide the total number of hot dog buns by the total number of students:\n\\[ 240 \\text{ buns} \\div 120 \\text{ students} = 2 \\text{ buns per student} \\]\n\nThus, each of Mr. Gates' students can get \\(\\boxed{2}\\) hot dog buns.",

Since each package contains 8 buns and he bought 30 packages, we multiply 8 by 30:\n\\[\n8 \\times 30 = 240\n\\]\nSo, Mr. Gates bought 240 hot dog buns.\n\nNext, we determine the total number of students. Mr. Gates has four classes, and each class has 30 students. Therefore, we multiply 4 by 30:\n\\[\n4 \\times 30 = 120\n\\]\nSo, Mr. Gates has 120 students.\n\nNow, we divide the total number of hot dog buns by the total number of students to find out how many hot dog buns each student can get:\n\\[\n240 \\div 120 = 2\n\\]\nSo, each student can get 2 hot dog buns.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
