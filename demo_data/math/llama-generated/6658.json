        "To determine how many hours before the deadline Keenan needs to start writing her essay to finish on time, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and solve it step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of words Keenan writes in the first two hours:**\n   Keenan writes 400 words per hour for the first two hours.\n   \\[\n   400 \\text{ words/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 800 \\text{ words}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many words Keenan has left to write after the first two hours:**\n   The total essay is 1200 words, and she has already written 800 words.\n   \\[\n   1200 \\text{ words} - 800 \\text{ words} = 400 \\text{ words}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of hours Keenan needs to write the remaining words:**\n   After the first two hours, Keenan writes 200 words per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to write the remaining 400 words, we divide the number of words left by her writing speed.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400 \\text{ words}}{200 \\text{ words/hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the total number of hours Keenan needs to start writing:**\n   Keenan needs to write for 2 hours in the first two hours and then another 2 hours after that.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Keenan needs to start writing her essay 4 hours before the deadline to finish on time.

Distribute the 200 in the second term:\n   \\[\n   800 + 200x - 400 = 1200\n   \\]\n\n2. Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   400 + 200x = 1200\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract 400 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   200x = 800\n   \\]\n\n4. Divide both sides by 200:\n   \\[\n   x = 4\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Keenan needs to start writing her essay \\(\\boxed{4}\\) hours before the deadline to finish on time.",

        "To determine how many hours before the deadline Keenan needs to start writing her essay, we need to calculate the total time she spends writing the essay based on her writing speed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many words Keenan writes in the first two hours:\n\\[\n400 \\text{ words/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 800 \\text{ words}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many words she has left to write after the first two hours:\n\\[\n1200 \\text{ words} - 800 \\text{ words} = 400 \\text{ words}\n\\]\n\nAfter the first two hours, Keenan writes at a speed of 200 words per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to write the remaining 400 words, we divide the remaining words by her writing speed:\n\\[\n\\frac{400 \\text{ words}}{200 \\text{ words/hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the time spent writing the first 800 words to the time spent writing the remaining 400 words:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Keenan needs to start 4 hours before the deadline to finish her essay on time. The final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many hours before the deadline Keenan needs to start to finish her essay on time, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of words she writes in the first two hours and the number of words she writes after the first two hours.\n\n1. Calculate the number of words Keenan writes in the first two hours:\n   \\[\n   400 \\text{ words/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 800 \\text{ words}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the number of words Keenan has left to write after the first two hours:\n   \\[\n   1200 \\text{ words} - 800 \\text{ words} = 400 \\text{ words}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the number of hours Keenan needs to write the remaining 400 words at a rate of 200 words per hour:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400 \\text{ words}}{200 \\text{ words/hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. Add the number of hours she writes in the first two hours to the number of hours she writes after the first two hours to find the total time she needs to write the essay:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Keenan needs to start \\(\\boxed{4}\\) hours before the deadline to finish her essay on time.",
        "To determine how many hours before the deadline Keenan needs to start writing her essay to finish on time, we can break down the problem into smaller parts.\n\n1. Calculate the number of words Keenan writes in the first two hours.\n2. Determine how many words she still needs to write after the first two hours.\n3. Calculate the time it takes her to write the remaining words.\n4. Add the time taken to write the remaining words to the initial two hours to find the total time needed.\n\nLet's start with the first part:\n\n1. Keenan writes 400 words per hour for the first two hours.\n   \\[\n   400 \\text{ words/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 800 \\text{ words}\n   \\]\n   So, she writes 800 words in the first two hours.\n\n2. The total length of the essay is 1200 words. After the first two hours, she still needs to write:\n   \\[\n   1200 \\text{ words} - 800 \\text{ words} = 400 \\text{ words}\n   \\]\n\n3. After the first two hours, Keenan writes 200 words per hour. The time it takes her to write the remaining 400 words is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400 \\text{ words}}{200 \\text{ words/hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. Adding the time taken to write the remaining words to the initial two hours, the total time needed is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Keenan needs to start 4 hours before the deadline to finish her essay on time.

Let's denote the number of additional hours she writes as \\( x \\). The total number of words she writes in these additional hours is:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ words/hour} \\times x \\text{ hours} = 200x \\text{ words} \\]\n\nThe total number of words she writes is the sum of the words she writes in the first two hours and the words she writes in the additional hours:\n\\[ 800 \\text{ words} + 200x \\text{ words} = 1200 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( x \\) by isolating \\( x \\) on one side of the equation:\n\\[ 800 + 200x = 1200 \\]\n\\[ 200x = 1200 - 800 \\]\n\\[ 200x = 400 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{400}{200} \\]\n\\[ x = 2 \\]\n\nSo, after the first two hours, Keenan writes for an additional 2 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours she needs to write the essay is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, Keenan needs to start 4 hours before the deadline to finish her essay on time.

To find out how many hours it will take her to write the remaining 400 words, we divide the number of remaining words by her writing speed:\n\\[ 400 \\text{ words} \\div 200 \\text{ words/hour} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of hours Keenan needs to start before the deadline.**\n\nKeenan spends 2 hours writing the first part and 2 hours writing the second part, so the total time she needs to start before the deadline is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, Keenan needs to start \\(\\boxed{4}\\) hours before the deadline to finish her essay on time.",
        "To determine how many hours before the deadline Keenan needs to start writing her essay to finish on time, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many words Keenan writes in the first two hours:\n\\[\n400 \\text{ words/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 800 \\text{ words}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many words she still has left to write after the first two hours:\n\\[\n1200 \\text{ words} - 800 \\text{ words} = 400 \\text{ words}\n\\]\n\nAfter the first two hours, Keenan writes at a rate of 200 words per hour. We need to determine how many hours it will take her to write the remaining 400 words:\n\\[\n\\frac{400 \\text{ words}}{200 \\text{ words/hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the time she spent writing the first 800 words to the time she will spend writing the remaining 400 words:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Keenan needs to start writing her essay \\(\\boxed{4}\\) hours before the deadline to finish on time."
