        "To determine how many more pizza rolls Tyler ate than Jackson, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how many pizza rolls Jerome ate.\n2. Calculate how many pizza rolls Tyler ate.\n3. Find the difference between the number of pizza rolls Tyler ate and the number of pizza rolls Jackson ate.\n\nFirst, we know that Jackson ate 10 pizza rolls. Jerome ate twice that amount, so we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{pytest rolls Jerome ate} = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, Tyler ate one and a half times more than Jerome.
