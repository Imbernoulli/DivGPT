        "To determine the total number of miles Laura drives per week, we need to break down her driving schedule and calculate the distances for each day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Laura drives to school each day:\n- Laura's house is 20 miles from her school.\n- Therefore, the round trip distance is \\( 20 \\) miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance Laura drives to the supermarket each time:\n- The supermarket is 10 miles farther away from the school than her house.\n- So, the one-way distance to the supermarket is \\( 20 + 10 = 30 \\) miles.\n- Therefore, the round trip distance to the supermarket is \\( 30 \\times 2 = 60 \\) miles.\n\nNow, let's determine the total distance Laura drives in a week:\n- Laura drives to school every morning. Since there are 5 school days in a week, the total distance for school trips is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 20 = 100 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n- Laura drives to the supermarket two afternoons a week. The total distance for supermarket trips is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we add the distances for school trips and supermarket trips to find the total distance Laura drives per week:\n\\[\n100 + 120 = 220 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of miles Laura drives per week is \\(\\boxed{220}\\).",
