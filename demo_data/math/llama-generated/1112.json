        "To determine the total number of hours Iggy spends running from Monday to Friday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance Iggy runs from Monday to Friday.\n2. Determine the total time Iggy spends running based on his pace.\n3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Iggy runs:\n\n- On Monday, he runs 3 miles.\n- On Tuesday, he runs 4 miles.\n- On Wednesday, he runs 6 miles.\n- On Thursday, he runs 8 miles.\n- On Friday, he runs 3 miles.\n\nAdding these distances together, we get:\n\\[ 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 3 = 24 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total time Iggy spends running. Since Iggy runs at a pace of 1 mile in 10 minutes, we can find the total time by multiplying the total distance by his pace:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ miles} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes per mile} = 240 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total time by 60:\n\\[ 240 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours that Iggy spends running from Monday to Friday is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
