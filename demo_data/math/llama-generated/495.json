Determine how much money she has left after buying the swimming goggles.\n\nFirst, we calculate how much money Mary spent on the video game:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount spent on the video game} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25\n\\]\nAfter buying the video game, the amount of money Mary has left is:\n\\[\n100 - 25 = 75\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate how much money Mary spent on swimming goggles. She spent a fifth of the remaining $75:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount spent on swimming goggles} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 75 = 15\n\\]\nAfter buying the swimming goggles, the amount of money Mary has left is:\n\\[\n75 - 15 = 60\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Mary has left is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{60}\n\\]",
        "Mary starts with $100. First, she spends a quarter of it on a new video game. To find out how much she spends, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25\n\\]\n\nSo, Mary spends $25 on the video game. To find out how much money she has left after buying the video game, we subtract $25 from $100:\n\n\\[\n100 - 25 = 75\n\\]\n\nNext, Mary spends a fifth of the remaining $75 on swimming goggles. To find out how much she spends, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times 75 = 15\n\\]\n\nSo, Mary spends $15 on swimming goggles. To find out how much money she has left after buying the swimming goggles, we subtract $15 from $75:\n\n\\[\n75 - 15 = 60\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Mary has left is \\boxed{60}.",
