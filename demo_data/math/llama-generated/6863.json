        "To determine how many more dozen appetizers Patsy needs to make, we first calculate the total number of appetizers required for her guests. Since she has 30 guests and each guest needs 6 appetizers, we multiply:\n\n\\[\n30 \\times 6 = 180\n\\]\n\nSo, Patsy needs a total of 180 appetizers. Next, we calculate the total number of appetizers she has already made. She is making 3 dozen deviled eggs, 2 dozen pigs in a blanket, and 2 dozen kebabs. Since each dozen equals 12 appetizers, we multiply the number of dozens by 12 for each type of appetizer:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 12 = 36 \\quad \\text{(deviled eggs)}\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\times 12 = 24 \\quad \\text{(pigs in a blanket)}\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\times 12 = 24 \\quad \\text{(kebabs)}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of appetizers from each type:\n\n\\[\n36 + 24 + 24 = 84\n\\]\n\nSo, Patsy has already made 84 appetizers. To find out how many more appetizers she needs, we subtract the number of appetizers she has from the total number of appetizers required:\n\n\\[\n180 - 84 = 96\n\\]\n\nSince each dozen equals 12 appetizers, we convert the number of additional appetizers needed into dozens by dividing by 12:\n\n\\[\n96 \\div 12 = 8\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Patsy needs to make \\boxed{8} more dozen appetizers.",
