        "To determine how much Emilee earns, we start by identifying the earnings of each person based on the information given.\n\n1. We know that Terrence earns $30.\n2. Jermaine earns $5 more than Terrence. Therefore, we calculate Jermaine's earnings as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jermaine's earnings} = \\text{Terrence's earnings} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35\n   \\]\n3. The total earnings of Jermaine, Terrence, and Emilee is $90. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jermaine's earnings} + \\text{Terrence's earnings} + \\text{Emilee's earnings} = 90\n   \\]\n4. Substituting the known values for Jermaine's and Terrence's earnings into the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   35 + 30 + \\text{Emilee's earnings} = 90\n   \\]\n5. Simplifying the left side of the equation, we have:\n   \\[\n   65 + \\text{Emilee's earnings} = 90\n   \\]\n6. To find Emilee's earnings, we subtract 65 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Emilee's earnings} = 90 - 65 = 25\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Emilee earns \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
