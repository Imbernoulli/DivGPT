Since she tutored 35 hours in the first month, we add 5 hours to 35 hours:\n\\[ 35 + 5 = 40 \\]\nSo, Mikaela tutored 40 hours in the second month.\n\n**Step 2: Determine her total earnings for both months.**\n\nMikaela earns $10 per hour. Therefore, her earnings for the first month are:\n\\[ 35 \\times 10 = 350 \\]\nHer earnings for the second month are:\n\\[ 40 \\times 10 = 400 \\]\nAdding these amounts gives her total earnings for both months:\n\\[ 350 + 400 = 750 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how much she spent on her personal needs.**\n\nMikaela spent \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) of her total earnings on her personal needs. So, we multiply her total earnings by \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\):\n\\[ 750 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 750 \\times 0.8 = 600 \\]\nSo, Mikaela spent $600 on her personal needs.\n\n**Step 4: Find out how much she saved.**\n\nThe amount Mikaela saved is the remaining part of her total earnings after spending on her personal needs. We subtract the amount she spent from her total earnings:\n\\[ 750 - 600 = 150 \\]\nSo, Mikaela saved \\(\\boxed{150}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine how much Mikaela saved, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of hours Mikaela tutored in the second month.\n2.
