        "To determine the average marks scored by Tatuya, Ivanna, and Dorothy, we need to find the individual scores of each student and then calculate the average.\n\nFirst, let's find Ivanna's score.

Ivanna scored \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) times as many marks as Dorothy.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ivanna's score} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 90 = \\frac{3 \\times 90}{5} = \\frac{270}{5} = 54\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine Tatuya's score:\n   Tatuya scored twice as much as Ivanna.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tatuya's score} = 2 \\times 54 = 108\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the total marks scored by all three:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total marks} = \\text{Tatuya's score} + \\text{Ivanna's score} + \\text{Dorothy's score} = 108 + 54 + 90 = 252\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the average marks scored by the three:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average marks} = \\frac{\\text{Total marks}}{3} = \\frac{252}{3} = 84\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average marks scored by the three is \\(\\boxed{84}\\).",
        "To determine the average marks scored by Tatuya, Ivanna, and Dorothy, we need to find the individual scores of each student and then calculate the average.\n\nFirst, we know Dorothy's score:\n\\[ D = 90 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find Ivanna's score. According to the problem, Ivanna scored \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) times as many marks as Dorothy:\n\\[ I = \\frac{3}{5} \\times D = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 90 = \\frac{270}{5} = 54 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find Tatuya's score. The problem states that Tatuya scored twice as much as Ivanna:\n\\[ T = 2 \\times I = 2 \\times 54 = 108 \\]\n\nNow that we have the scores of all three students, we can calculate the average score. The average score is the sum of their scores divided by the number of students:\n\\[ \\text{Average} = \\frac{T + I + D}{3} = \\frac{108 + 54 + 90}{3} = \\frac{252}{3} = 84 \\]\n\nTherefore, the average marks scored by the three is:\n\\[ \\boxed{84} \\]"
