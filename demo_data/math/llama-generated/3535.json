        "To determine how much taller Mike is than Mark in inches, we need to convert their heights from feet and inches to just inches, and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's convert Mark's height to inches. Mark is 5 feet 3 inches tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches and then add the remaining inches:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 60 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\nAdding the 3 inches gives:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ inches} + 3 \\text{ inches} = 63 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's convert Mike's height to inches. Mike is 6 feet 1 inch tall. Again, we convert the feet to inches and then add the remaining inches:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 72 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\nAdding the 1 inch gives:\n\\[\n72 \\text{ inches} + 1 \\text{ inch} = 73 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in their heights:\n\\[\n73 \\text{ inches} - 63 \\text{ inches} = 10 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mike is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) inches taller than Mark.",
        "To determine how much taller Mike is than Mark in inches, we first need to convert the heights of both Mark and Mike into inches.\n\nStarting with Mark:\n- Mark is 5 feet 3 inches tall.\n- Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we multiply the number of feet by 12 and then add the remaining inches.\n- So, \\(5 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 60 \\text{ inches}\\).\n- Adding the 3 inches, we get \\(60 \\text{ inches} + 3 \\text{ inches} = 63 \\text{ inches}\\).\n\nNext, for Mike:\n- Mike is 6 feet 1 inch tall.\n- Similarly, we multiply the number of feet by 12 and then add the remaining inches.\n- So, \\(6 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 72 \\text{ inches}\\).\n- Adding the 1 inch, we get \\(72 \\text{ inches} + 1 \\text{ inch} = 73 \\text{ inches}\\).\n\nNow, we find the difference in their heights:\n- Mike's height is 73 inches and Mark's height is 63 inches.\n- The difference is \\(73 \\text{ inches} - 63 \\text{ inches} = 10 \\text{ inches}\\).\n\nTherefore, Mike is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) inches taller than Mark.",
