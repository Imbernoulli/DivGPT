It is mostly tangerine-colored, with blue, brown, and gold-colored decorative stripes.  There are three times as many gold stripes as brown stripes, and five times as many blue stripes as gold stripes. If there are 4 brown stripes, how many blue stripes does Vaishali's Saree have?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the number of blue stripes on Vaishali's Saree, we start by identifying the number of gold stripes. According to the problem, there are three times as many gold stripes as brown stripes. Since there are 4 brown stripes, we calculate the number of gold stripes as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of gold stripes} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of brown stripes} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of blue stripes. The problem states that there are five times as many blue stripes as gold stripes. Since there are 12 gold stripes, we calculate the number of blue stripes as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue stripes} = 5 \\times \\text{Number of gold stripes} = 5 \\times 12 = 60\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of blue stripes on Vaishali's Saree is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",

Therefore, we can calculate the number of blue stripes as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue stripes} = 5 \\times \\text{Number of gold stripes} = 5 \\times 12 = 60\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of blue stripes on Vaishali's Saree is \\boxed{60}.",
