        "Let's denote the cost of one hat by \\( h \\) dollars and the cost of one scarf by \\( s \\) dollars. According to the problem, Kiki buys twice as many hats as scarves.

The total amount of money spent is \\( 2xh + xs \\). According to the problem, she spends 60% of her money on hats and 40% on scarves. If she has $90, then she spends \\( 0.6 \\times 90 = 54 \\) dollars on hats and \\( 0.4 \\times 90 = 36 \\) dollars on scarves. Therefore, we can write the following equations:\n\n\\[ 2xh = 54 \\]\n\\[ xs = 36 \\]\n\nWe can solve these equations for \\( h \\) and \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{54}{2x} = \\frac{27}{x} \\]\n\\[ s = \\frac{36}{x} \\]\n\nWe are given that the cost of a scarf is $2, so \\( s = 2 \\).

According to the problem, the cost of the hats is 60% of the total amount spent, so we can write the equation:\n\\[\n2xh = 0.6(2xh + xs)\n\\]\nWe can simplify this equation by first dividing both sides by \\( x \\) (assuming \\( x \\neq 0 \\)):\n\\[\n2h = 0.6(2h + s)\n\\]\nNext, we expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[\n2h = 1.2h + 0.6s\n\\]\nThen, we isolate \\( h \\) by subtracting \\( 1.2h \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n2h - 1.2h = 0.6s\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n0.8h = 0.6s\n\\]\nWe can solve for \\( h \\) in terms of \\( s \\) by dividing both sides by 0.8:\n\\[\nh = \\frac{0.6s}{0.8} = \\frac{3s}{4}\n\\]\nSince the price of a scarf is $2, we substitute \\( s = 2 \\) into the equation for \\( h \\):\n\\[\nh = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\n\\]\nSo, the price of one hat is $1.50.

Since she buys twice as many hats as scarves, she buys \\( 2x \\) hats. The total cost of the hats is \\( 2xh \\) dollars and the total cost of the scarves is \\( xs \\) dollars. According to the problem, she spends 60% of her money on hats and 40% on scarves. If Kiki has $90, then she spends \\( 0.6 \\times 90 = 54 \\) dollars on hats and \\( 0.4 \\times 90 = 36 \\) dollars on scarves. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:\n\n\\[ 2xh = 54 \\]\n\\[ xs = 36 \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( x \\). First, let's solve for \\( h \\) and \\( s \\) in terms of \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{54}{2x} = \\frac{27}{x} \\]\n\\[ s = \\frac{36}{x} \\]\n\nSince we know the price of a scarf is $2, we can substitute \\( s = 2 \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 2 = \\frac{36}{x} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{36}{2} = 18 \\]\n\nSo, Kiki will buy \\( \\boxed{18} \\) scarves.",

        "Let's denote the price of one hat by \\( h \\) dollars and the price of one scarf by \\( s \\) dollars. According to the problem, Kiki spends 60% of her money on hats when she buys twice as many hats as scarves.\n\nFirst, let's express the total cost of the hats and scarves in terms of the number of scarves she buys. Let \\( x \\) be the number of scarves she buys. Then, she buys \\( 2x \\) hats. The total cost for the hats is \\( 2xh \\) dollars and the total cost for the scarves is \\( xs \\) dollars. The total amount spent is \\( 2xh + xs \\) dollars, and we know that 60% of this total is spent on hats. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n2xh = 0.6(2xh + xs)\n\\]\n\nNext, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\\[\n2xh = 1.2xh + 0.6xs\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( h \\), we subtract \\( 1.2xh \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n2xh - 1.2xh = 0.6xs\n\\]\n\\[\n0.8xh = 0.6xs\n\\]\n\nWe can divide both sides by \\( x \\) (assuming \\( x \\neq 0 \\)):\n\\[\n0.8h = 0.6s\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( h \\) in terms of \\( s \\), we divide both sides by 0.8:\n\\[\nh = \\frac{0.6s}{0.8} = \\frac{3s}{4}\n\\]\n\nWe know that the price of a scarf is $2, so we substitute \\( s = 2 \\) into the equation for \\( h \\):\n\\[\nh = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\n\\]\n\nNow we know that the price of a hat is $1.50. Kiki currently has $90. If she buys \\( x \\) scarves, she spends \\( 2x \\) dollars on scarves. She spends the rest of her money on hats. The remaining money after buying scarves is \\( 90 - 2x \\) dollars, and she spends this amount on hats. Since she buys twice as many hats as scarves, she buys \\( 2x \\) hats, and the cost of the hats is \\( 1.5 \\times 2x = 3x \\) dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n90 - 2x = 3x\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we add \\( 2x \\) to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n90 = 5x\n\\]\n\nThen we divide both sides by 5:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{90}{5} = 18\n\\]\n\nSo, Kiki will buy \\(\\boxed{18}\\) scarves.",

We can set up the following equations based on the total cost:\n\n\\[ 2x \\cdot p_h = 54 \\]\n\\[ x \\cdot p_s = 36 \\]\n\nWe also know that the price of a scarf is $2, so \\( p_s = 2 \\).

        "To determine how many scarves Kiki will buy, we need to first find out the cost of each hat and each scarf. Let's denote the cost of one hat as \\( h \\) dollars and the cost of one scarf as \\( s \\) dollars. According to the problem, Kiki spends 60% of her money on hats when she buys twice as many hats as scarves.\n\nLet's say Kiki buys \\( x \\) scarves. Then she buys \\( 2x \\) hats. The total cost of the hats is \\( 2xh \\) and the total cost of the scarves is \\( xs \\). Since she spends 60% of her money on hats, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 2xh = 0.6 \\times \\text{total amount spent} \\]\nSince the total amount spent is $90, we substitute 90 for the total amount spent:\n\\[ 2xh = 0.6 \\times 90 \\]\n\\[ 2xh = 54 \\]\n\\[ xh = 27 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)} \\]\n\nWe also know that the rest of her money, which is 40% of $90, is spent on scarves:\n\\[ xs = 0.4 \\times 90 \\]\n\\[ xs = 36 \\]\n\\[ x s = 36 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)} \\]\n\nWe now have two equations:\n1. \\( xh = 27 \\)\n2. \\( xs = 36 \\)\n\nTo find the ratio of the cost of a hat to the cost of a scarf, we divide Equation 1 by Equation 2:\n\\[ \\frac{xh}{xs} = \\frac{27}{36} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{h}{s} = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\\[ h = \\frac{3}{4}s \\]\n\nWe are given that the cost of each scarf is $2, so we substitute \\( s = 2 \\) into the equation \\( h = \\frac{3}{4}s \\):\n\\[ h = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ h = 1.5 \\]\n\nNow we know that the cost of each hat is $1.50 and the cost of each scarf is $2. We can substitute \\( h = 1.5 \\) and \\( s = 2 \\) back into Equation 2 to find \\( x \\):\n\\[ x \\times 2 = 36 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{36}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 18 \\]\n\nTherefore, Kiki will buy \\(\\boxed{18}\\) scarves.",

We know that she spends 60% of her money on hats and 40% on scarves. If she has $90, then she spends $54 on hats and $36 on scarves. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:\n\n\\[\n2xh = 0.6 \\times 90 = 54\n\\]\n\\[\nxs = 0.4 \\times 90 = 36\n\\]\n\nFrom the second equation, we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{36}{s}\n\\]\n\nWe are given that the price of a scarf is $2, so \\( s = 2 \\). Substituting \\( s = 2 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{36}{2} = 18\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Kiki will buy \\(\\boxed{18}\\) scarves.",
