        "To determine how much money Mark saves by buying the cheaper lens, we need to calculate the cost of the $300 lens after the 20% discount and then compare it to the cost of the $220 lens.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discount on the $300 lens. The discount is 20%, so we multiply $300 by 20% (or 0.20):\n\\[ 300 \\times 0.20 = 60 \\]\nThis means the discount is $60. Therefore, the cost of the $300 lens after the discount is:\n\\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \\]\nSo, the $300 lens costs $240 after the discount.\n\nNext, we compare the cost of the $240 lens to the cost of the $220 lens. The difference in cost is:\n\\[ 240 - 220 = 20 \\]\nTherefore, Mark saves $20 by buying the $220 lens instead of the $300 lens.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",

To find 20% of $300, we multiply $300 by 0.20:\n\\[ 300 \\times 0.20 = 60 \\]\n\nSo, the discount on the $300 lens is $60.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the price of the $300 lens after the discount.**\n\nSubtract the discount from the original price of the $300 lens:\n\\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \\]\n\nSo, the price of the $300 lens after the discount is $240.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the discounted price of the $300 lens to the price of the $220 lens.**\n\nThe $220 lens is cheaper than the $240 lens. To find out how much money Mark saves, we subtract the price of the $220 lens from the price of the $240 lens:\n\\[ 240 - 220 = 20 \\]\n\nSo, Mark saves $20 by buying the $220 lens instead of the $300 lens.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the savings.**\n\nThe savings is $20.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Mark saves by buying the cheaper lens is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
