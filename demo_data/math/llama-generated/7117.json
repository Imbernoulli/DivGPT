        "To find the wholesale price of the pants, we start by letting \\( W \\) represent the wholesale price. The store owner adds 80% to the wholesale price to set the retail price.

        "To find the wholesale price of the pants, let's denote the wholesale price by \\( W \\). According to the problem, the retail price is 80% more than the wholesale price. This means the retail price is the wholesale price plus 80% of the wholesale price, which can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Retail Price} = W + 0.8W = 1.8W \\]\n\nWe are given that the retail price of the pants is $36. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 1.8W = 36 \\]\n\nTo find \\( W \\), we need to solve for \\( W \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.8:\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{36}{1.8} \\]\n\nPerforming the division, we get:\n\n\\[ W = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the wholesale price of the pants is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
        "To find the wholesale price of the pants, we need to understand the relationship between the wholesale price and the retail price. The retail price is the wholesale price plus 80% of the wholesale price. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Retail Price} = \\text{Wholesale Price} + 0.80 \\times \\text{Wholesale Price} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Retail Price} = 1.80 \\times \\text{Wholesale Price} \\]\n\nWe know the retail price is $36. So, we can substitute $36 for the retail price in the equation and solve for the wholesale price:\n\n\\[ 36 = 1.80 \\times \\text{Wholesale Price} \\]\n\nTo isolate the wholesale price, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.80:\n\n\\[ \\text{Wholesale Price} = \\frac{36}{1.80} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Wholesale Price} = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wholesale price of the pants is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."
