Determine the total number of reward bowls given out.\n3. Subtract the total number of reward bowls from the initial number of bowls in the rewards collection.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of bowls bought by the customers. There are 20 customers, and half of them bought 20 bowls each. Therefore, the number of customers who bought 20 bowls each is:\n\\[ \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\]\n\nThe total number of bowls bought by these 10 customers is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 20 = 200 \\]\n\nThe other 10 customers did not buy any bowls, so the total number of bowls bought by all customers is:\n\\[ 200 + 0 = 200 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of reward bowls given out. Howard rewards 2 bowls for every 10 bowls bought. Therefore, the number of reward bowls given out is:\n\\[ \\frac{200}{10} \\times 2 = 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of reward bowls from the initial number of bowls in the rewards collection:\n\\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \\]\n\nThus, the number of bowls remaining in the rewards collection is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",

Howard had 20 customers, and half of them bought 20 bowls each. Therefore, the number of customers who bought 20 bowls each is:\n\\[ \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\]\nSince each of these 10 customers bought 20 bowls, the total number of bowls sold is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 20 = 200 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of reward bowls given out. Howard rewards 2 bowls for every 10 bowls bought. Therefore, the number of reward bowls given out is:\n\\[ \\frac{200}{10} \\times 2 = 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of reward bowls given out from the initial number of reward bowls. The initial number of reward bowls is 70, so the number of bowls remaining is:\n\\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \\]\n\nThus, the number of bowls remaining in the rewards collection is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",
