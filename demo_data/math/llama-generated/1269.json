Subtract the number of apples sold from the total number of apples to find out how many apples Ella has left.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of apples in the 4 bags with 20 apples each:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 20 = 80\n   \\]\n   So, Ella has 80 apples from the 4 bags.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of apples in the 6 bags with 25 apples each:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 25 = 150\n   \\]\n   So, Ella has 150 apples from the 6 bags.\n\n3. Add the two totals together to find the total number of apples Ella initially has:\n   \\[\n   80 + 150 = 230\n   \\]\n   So, Ella initially has 230 apples.\n\n4. Subtract the number of apples sold from the total number of apples to find out how many apples Ella has left:\n   \\[\n   230 - 200 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, Ella has 30 apples left.\n\nTherefore, the number of apples Ella has left is \\boxed{30}.",
