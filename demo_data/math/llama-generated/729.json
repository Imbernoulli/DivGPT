        "To determine the total number of buttons the tailor purchased, we need to calculate the number of each color of button and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Green Buttons:**\n   The tailor bought 90 green buttons.\n\n2. **Yellow Buttons:**\n   The tailor bought 10 more yellow buttons than the green buttons. Therefore, we add 10 to the number of green buttons:\n   \\[\n   90 + 10 = 100\n   \\]\n   So, the tailor bought 100 yellow buttons.\n\n3. **Blue Buttons:**\n   The tailor bought 5 fewer blue buttons than the green buttons.
