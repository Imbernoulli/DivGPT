Calculate the total number of pizzas made by Craig over the two days.\n6. Add the total number of pizzas made by Heather and Craig together.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Craig made 40 pizzas on the first day. Since Heather made four times as many pizzas as Craig on the first day, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Heather's pizzas on the first day} = 4 \\times 40 = 160\n   \\]\n\n2. On the second day, Heather made 20 fewer pizzas than Craig. First, we need to find out how many pizzas Craig made on the second day. Craig made 60 more pizzas on the second day than on the first day, so:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Craig's pizzas on the second day} = 40 + 60 = 100\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Heather made:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Heather's pizzas on the second day} = 100 - 20 = 80\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we calculate the total number of pizzas made by Heather over the two days:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Heather's total pizzas} = 160 + 80 = 240\n   \\]\n\n4. And we calculate the total number of pizzas made by Craig over the two days:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Craig's total pizzas} = 40 + 100 = 140\n   \\]\n\n5. Finally, we add the total number of pizzas made by Heather and Craig together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pizzas} = 240 + 140 = 380\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of pizzas the two made together in the two days is \\(\\boxed{380}\\).",
