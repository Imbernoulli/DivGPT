        "Let's denote the total amount of money Shara borrowed from her brother as \\( x \\) dollars.\n\nAccording to the problem, Shara has returned half of the money she borrowed. Therefore, the amount she has returned so far is:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2} \\]\n\nShara has been returning $10 per month for 6 months. So, the total amount she has returned over these 6 months is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince the amount she has returned so far is equal to half of the total amount borrowed, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2} = 60 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 2:\n\\[ x = 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\]\n\nSo, Shara borrowed $120. currently, she has returned half of this amount, which is $60.
