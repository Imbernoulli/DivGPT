        "To determine how much charcoal Jason adds, we start by understanding the given ratio of charcoal to water. The ratio is 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water. We need to find out how much charcoal corresponds to 900 ml of water.\n\nFirst, we set up a proportion based on the given ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\text{ grams}}{30 \\text{ ml}} = \\frac{x \\text{ grams}}{900 \\text{ ml}}\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the amount of charcoal needed for 900 ml of water.\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by cross-multiplying:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ grams} \\times 900 \\text{ ml} = 30 \\text{ ml} \\times x \\text{ grams}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n1800 = 30x\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 30:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1800}{30}\n\\]\n\nPerforming the division, we find:\n\\[\nx = 60\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jason adds \\(\\boxed{60}\\) grams of charcoal.",
        "To determine how much charcoal Jason needs to add, we start by understanding the ratio of charcoal to water given in the problem. The ratio is 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many hours of water Jason is using compared to the reference amount. Jason adds 900 ml of water, and the reference amount is 30 ml. We calculate the number of times the reference amount fits into 900 ml by dividing 900 by 30:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{900 \\text{ ml}}{30 \\text{ ml}} = 30\n\\]\n\nThis means Jason is using 30 times more water than the reference amount. Since the ratio of charcoal to water is 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water, he will also need 30 times more charcoal than the reference amount. The reference amount of charcoal is 2 grams, so we multiply 2 grams by 30:\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ grams} \\times 30 = 60 \\text{ grams}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jason needs to add \\boxed{60} grams of charcoal.",
