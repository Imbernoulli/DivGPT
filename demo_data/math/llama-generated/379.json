        "To determine the price of the pants, let's denote the price of the pants as \\( p \\) dollars. According to the problem, the price of the shirt is three-quarters of the price of the pants, so the price of the shirt is \\( \\frac{3}{4}p \\) dollars. The price of the shoes is ten dollars more than the price of the pants, so the price of the shoes is \\( p + 10 \\) dollars.\n\nThe total cost of the shirt, pants, and shoes is given as $340. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}p + p + (p + 10) = 340\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}p + p + p + 10 = 340\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}p + 2p + 10 = 340\n\\]\n\nTo combine the terms involving \\( p \\), we need a common denominator.
