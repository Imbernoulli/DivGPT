Therefore, \\( L = 45 \\).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of frogs in Lake Crystal. Since Lake Crystal has twenty percent fewer frogs than Lassie Lake, we can find the number of frogs in Lake Crystal by subtracting twenty percent of the number of frogs in Lassie Lake from the number of frogs in Lassie Lake. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of frogs in Lake Crystal} = L - 0.2L = 0.8L\n\\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( L \\) (which is 45) into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of frogs in Lake Crystal} = 0.8 \\times 45 = 36\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of frogs in both lakes to find the total number of frogs:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of frogs} = \\text{Number of frogs in Lassie Lake} + \\text{Number of frogs in Lake Crystal} = 45 + 36 = 81\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of frogs in the two lakes is \\(\\boxed{81}\\).",
