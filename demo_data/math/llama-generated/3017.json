        "To determine the internal volume of the box in cubic feet, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the internal dimensions of the box:**\n   - The external dimensions of the box are 26 inches by 26 inches by 14 inches.\n   - Since the walls are 1 inch thick on each side, we subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from each external dimension to find the internal dimensions.\n   - Internal length: \\(26 - 2 = 24\\) inches\n   - Internal width: \\(26 - 2 = 24\\) inches\n   - Internal height: \\(14 - 2 = 12\\) inches\n\n2. **Calculate the internal volume in cubic inches:**\n   - The volume \\(V\\) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     V = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{height}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the internal dimensions:\n     \\[\n     V = 24 \\times 24 \\times 12\n     \\]\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   - First, calculate \\(24 \\times 24\\):\n     \\[\n     24 \\times 24 = 576\n     \\]\n   - Next, multiply the result by 12:\n     \\[\n     576 \\times 12 = 6912\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the internal volume in cubic inches is 6912 cubic inches.\n\n4. **Convert cubic inches to cubic feet:**\n   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so there are \\(12 \\times 12 \\times 12 = 1728\\) cubic inches in a cubic foot.\n   - To convert cubic inches to cubic feet, divide the volume in cubic inches by 1728:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{6912}{1728} = 4\n     \\]\n\nThus, the internal volume of the box in cubic feet is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

Calculate the internal width:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Internal width} = 26 - 2 \\times 1 = 26 - 2 = 24 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the internal height:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Internal height} = 14 - 2 \\times 1 = 14 - 2 = 12 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we find the internal volume by multiplying the internal length, width, and height:\n\\[\n\\text{Internal volume} = 24 \\times 24 \\times 12 \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\nTo convert the internal volume from cubic inches to cubic feet, we use the fact that 1 cubic foot is equal to \\(12 \\times 12 \\times 12 = 1728\\) cubic inches. Therefore, we divide the internal volume in cubic inches by 1728:\n\\[\n\\text{Internal volume in cubic feet} = \\frac{24 \\times 24 \\times 12}{1728}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the numerator:\n\\[\n24 \\times 24 = 576\n\\]\n\\[\n576 \\times 12 = 6912\n\\]\n\nNow, divide the result by 1728:\n\\[\n\\frac{6912}{1728} = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the internal volume of the box is \\(\\boxed{4}\\) cubic feet."
