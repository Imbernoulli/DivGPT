So, we divide 1000 by 8:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Width of the garden} = \\frac{1000}{8} = 125 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the length of the garden. The length of Bob's property is 2250 feet, and he wants the length of the garden to be a tenth of the length of his property. So, we divide 2250 by 10:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length of the garden} = \\frac{2250}{10} = 225 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNow, we multiply the width of the garden by the length of the garden to find the area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the garden} = \\text{Width} \\times \\text{Length} = 125 \\times 225\n\\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication, we can break it down as follows:\n\n\\[\n125 \\times 225 = 125 \\times (200 + 25) = (125 \\times 200) + (125 \\times 25)\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(125 \\times 200\\):\n\n\\[\n125 \\times 200 = 25000\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate \\(125 \\times 25\\):\n\n\\[\n125 \\times 25 = 3125\n\\]\n\nNow, add the two results together:\n\n\\[\n25000 + 3125 = 28125\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of Bob's garden is \\(\\boxed{28125}\\) square feet.",
        "To determine the area of Bob's vegetable garden, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the width of the garden.\n2. Calculate the length of the garden.\n3. Multiply the width by the length to find the area.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the width of the garden. Bob wants the width to be about an eighth of the width of his property. The width of his property is 1000 feet. So, we compute:\n\\[\n\\text{Width of the garden} = \\frac{1000}{8} = 125 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the length of the garden. Bob wants the length to be a tenth of the length of his property. The length of his property is 2250 feet. So, we compute:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of the garden} = \\frac{2250}{10} = 225 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNow, we multiply the width and the length to find the area of the garden:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the garden} = \\text{Width} \\times \\text{Length} = 125 \\times 225\n\\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication, we can use the standard multiplication algorithm:\n\\[\n125 \\times 225 = 125 \\times (200 + 25) = (125 \\times 200) + (125 \\times 25)\n\\]\n\\[\n125 \\times 200 = 25000\n\\]\n\\[\n125 \\times 25 = 3125\n\\]\n\\[\n25000 + 3125 = 28125\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of Bob's garden is \\boxed{28125} square feet."
