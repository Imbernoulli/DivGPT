        "To determine how many blueberries James needs to pick to make 6 pies, we can break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many blueberries are required for one quart of blueberry jam. Since there are 2 pints in a quart and each pint requires 200 blueberries, we can calculate the number of blueberries needed for one quart as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ pints/quart} \\times 200 \\text{ blueberries/pint} = 400 \\text{ blueberries/quart} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many blueberries are required for one blueberry pie. Since one blueberry pie requires one quart of blueberry jam, and we know that one quart requires 400 blueberries, we have:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ pie} = 400 \\text{ blueberries} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many blueberries are required for 6 pies. Since each pie requires 400 blueberries, we can calculate the total number of blueberries needed for 6 pies as follows:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ pies} \\times 400 \\text{ blueberries/pie} = 2400 \\text{ blueberries} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of blueberries James needs to pick to make 6 pies is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]",
