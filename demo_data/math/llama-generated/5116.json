        "To determine how many more people are in a city with 9000 cubic yards compared to a city with 6400 cubic yards, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the population of the city with 9000 cubic yards.\n2. Calculate the population of the city with 6400 cubic yards.\n3. Find the difference between the two populations.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the population of the city with 9000 cubic yards. Since the number of people living per cubic yard is 80, we multiply 9000 by 80:\n\\[\n9000 \\times 80 = 720000\n\\]\nSo, the city with 9000 cubic yards has a population of 720000 people.\n\nNext, let's calculate the population of the city with 6400 cubic yards. Again, since the number of people living per cubic yard is 80, we multiply 6400 by 80:\n\\[\n6400 \\times 80 = 512000\n\\]\nSo, the city with 6400 cubic yards has a population of 512000 people.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the two populations:\n\\[\n720000 - 512000 = 208000\n\\]\nSo, the city with 9000 cubic yards has 208000 more people than the city with 6400 cubic yards.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{208000}\n\\]",

Since the number of people per cubic yard is 80, we multiply 9000 by 80:\n\\[\n9000 \\times 80 = 720000\n\\]\nSo, the city with 9000 cubic yards has 720000 people.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of people in the city with 6400 cubic yards. Again, since the number of people per cubic yard is 80, we multiply 6400 by 80:\n\\[\n6400 \\times 80 = 512000\n\\]\nSo, the city with 6400 cubic yards has 512000 people.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the two populations:\n\\[\n720000 - 512000 = 208000\n\\]\nTherefore, the city with 9000 cubic yards has 208000 more people than the city with 6400 cubic yards.

The number of people per cubic yard is 80, so we multiply 9000 by 80:\n\\[\n9000 \\times 80 = 720000\n\\]\nSo, the population of the city with 9000 cubic yards is 720000.\n\nNext, we calculate the population of the city with 6400 cubic yards. Again, the number of people per cubic yard is 80, so we multiply 6400 by 80:\n\\[\n6400 \\times 80 = 512000\n\\]\nSo, the population of the city with 6400 cubic yards is 512000.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the two populations:\n\\[\n720000 - 512000 = 208000\n\\]\nSo, the city with 9000 cubic yards has 208000 more people than the city with 6400 cubic yards.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{208000}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many more people are in a city with 9000 cubic yards compared to a city with 6400 cubic yards, we need to calculate the population of each city and then find the difference between the two populations.\n\nFirst, we calculate the population of the city with 9000 cubic yards. The number of people per cubic yard is 80, so we multiply the volume of the city by the population density:\n\\[\n9000 \\text{ cubic yards} \\times 80 \\text{ people per cubic yard} = 720000 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the population of the city with 6400 cubic yards:\n\\[\n6400 \\text{ cubic yards} \\times 80 \\text{ people per cubic yard} = 512000 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the two populations:\n\\[\n720000 \\text{ people} - 512000 \\text{ people} = 208000 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are \\(\\boxed{208000}\\) more people in the city with 9000 cubic yards than in the city with 6400 cubic yards.",
