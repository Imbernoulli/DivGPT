        "To determine the percentage chance that Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria after getting bitten by a random mosquito, we need to consider the probabilities of each event happening and then use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for probabilities.\n\nLet's define the following probabilities:\n- \\( P(M) \\) is the probability that a mosquito is infected with malaria.\n- \\( P(Z) \\) is the probability that a mosquito is infected with Zika virus.\n- \\( P(C \\mid M) \\) is the probability that Jack gets infected with malaria after being bitten by an infected mosquito.\n- \\( P(C \\mid Z) \\) is the probability that Jack gets infected with Zika virus after being bitten by an infected mosquito.\n- \\( P(C \\mid M \\cap Z) \\) is the probability that Jack gets infected with either malaria or Zika virus after being bitten by a mosquito infected with both viruses.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- \\( P(M) = 0.40 \\)\n- \\( P(Z) = 0.20 \\)\n- \\( P(C \\mid M) = 0.50 \\) (but reduced by 50% due to the vaccine, so \\( P(C \\mid M) = 0.50 \\times 0.50 = 0.25 \\))\n- \\( P(C \\mid Z) = 0.50 \\)\n- Since the problem does not specify the probability of getting infected with both применuses after being bitten by a mosquito infected with both, we will assume that getting infected with one virus does not affect the probability of getting infected with the other. Therefore, \\( P(C \\mid M \\cap Z) = P(C \\mid M) + P(C \\mid Z) - P(C \\mid M) \\cdot P(C \\mid Z) = 0.25 + 0.50 - 0.25 \\times 0.50 = 0.25 + 0.50 - 0.125 = 0.625 \\)\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that Jack gets infected with either malaria or Zika virus after being bitten by a random mosquito, which is given by:\n\\[ P(C) = P(M) \\cdot P(C \\mid M) + P(Z) \\cdot P(C \\mid Z) - P(M) \\cdot P(Z) \\cdot P(C \\mid M \\cap Z) \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[ P(C) = 0.40 \\cdot 0.25 + 0.20 \\cdot 0.50 - 0.40 \\cdot 0.20 \\cdot 0.625 \\]\n\\[ P(C) = 0.10 + 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.15 \\]\n\nTo convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\\[ P(C) \\times 100 = 0.15 \\times 100 = 15\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage chance that Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
        "To determine the percentage chance that Jack catches either Zika virus or malaria after getting bitten by a random mosquito, we need to consider the probabilities of each event happening and how they interact. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the probability of getting bitten by a mosquito infected with malaria:**\n   - The probability that a mosquito is infected with malaria is 40%, or \\(0.4\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the probability of getting bitten by a mosquito infected with Zika virus:**\n   - The probability that a mosquito is infected with Zika virus is 20%, or \\(0.2\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of getting bitten by a mosquito infected with both malaria and Zika virus:**\n   - Since the problem does not specify that the infections are mutually exclusive, we assume they are independent. Therefore, the probability of getting bitten by a mosquito infected with both Đi and Zika virus is \\(0.4 \\times 0.2 = 0.08\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the probability of getting bitten by a mosquito infected with either malaria or Zika virus:**\n   - Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for probabilities, we add the probabilities of getting bitten by a mosquito infected with malaria and getting bitten by a mosquito infected with Zika virus, and then subtract the probability of getting bitten by a mosquito infected with both. This is given by \\(0.4 + 0.2 - 0.08 = 0.52\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the probability of getting infected with malaria after getting bitten by a mosquito infected with malaria:**\n   - Without the vaccine, the probability of getting infected with malaria is 50%, or \\(0.5\\). With the vaccine, this probability is reduced by 50%, so it becomes \\(0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the probability of getting infected with Zika virus after getting bitten by a mosquito infected with Zika virus:**\n   - The probability of getting infected with Zika virus remains 50%, or \\(0.5\\), since there is no vaccine for Zika virus.\n\n7. **Calculate the probability of getting infected with malaria after getting bitten by a mosquito:**\n   - This is the probability of getting bitten by a mosquito infected with malaria multiplied by the probability of getting infected with malaria after being bitten. This is \\(0.4 \\times 0.25 = 0.1\\).\n\n8. **Calculate the probability of getting infected with Zika virus after getting bitten by a mosquito:**\n   - This is the probability of getting bitten by a mosquito infected with Zika virus multiplied by the probability of getting infected with Zika virus after being bitten. This is \\(0.2 \\times 0.5 = 0.1\\).\n\n9. **Calculate the probability of getting infected with either malaria or Zika virus after getting bitten by a mosquito:**\n   - Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion again, we add the probabilities of getting infected with malaria and getting infected with Zika virus, and then subtract the probability of getting infected with both. The probability of getting infected with both is the probability of getting bitten by a mosquito infected with both ∀ Be multiplied by the probability of getting infected with both after being bitten.
