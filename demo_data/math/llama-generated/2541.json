        "To determine Jonathan's weekly caloric deficit, we need to calculate his total caloric intake and his total caloric expenditure for the week, and then find the difference between these two amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Jonathan's total caloric intake for the week. He consumes 2500 calories every day except for Saturday, when he consumes an extra 1000 calories. Therefore, his caloric intake for the six days from Sunday to Friday is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 2500 = 15000 \\text{ calories} \\]\nOn Saturday, he consumes:\n\\[ 2500 + 1000 = 3500 \\text{ calories} \\]\nAdding these together, his total caloric intake for the week is:\n\\[ 15000 + 3500 = 18500 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate Jonathan's total caloric expenditure for the week. He burns 3000 calories every day. Therefore, his total caloric expenditure for the week is:\n\\[ 7 \\times 3000 = 21000 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between his total caloric expenditure and his total caloric intake to determine his weekly caloric deficit:\n\\[ 21000 - 18500 = 2500 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nThus, Jonathan's weekly caloric deficit is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2500} \\]",
        "To determine Jonathan's weekly caloric deficit, we need to calculate the total number of calories he consumes in a week and compare it to the total number of calories he burns in a week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total calories consumed in a week. Jonathan eats 2500 calories every day except for Saturday, when he consumes an extra 1000 calories. Therefore, for 6 days (Monday through Friday and Sunday), he consumes 2500 calories each day, and for Saturday, he consumes 2500 + 1000 = 3500 calories.\n\nThe total calories consumed in a week is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 2500 + 3500 = 15000 + 3500 = 18500 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total calories burned in a week.

        "To determine Jonathan's weekly caloric deficit, we need to calculate his total caloric intake and his total caloric expenditure for the week, and then find the difference between these two amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate his total caloric intake for the week. Jonathan eats 2500 calories every day except for Saturday, when he consumes an extra 1000 calories. Therefore, his caloric intake for each day of the week is as follows:\n\n- For Sunday to Friday: \\(2500\\) calories per day.\n- For Saturday: \\(2500 + 1000 = 3500\\) calories.\n\nNow, let's sum up his caloric intake for the entire week:\n\\[\n\\text{Total caloric intake} = (2500 \\text{ calories/day} \\times 6 \\text{ days}) + 3500 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total caloric intake} = 15000 \\text{ calories} + 3500 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total caloric intake} = 18500 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate his total caloric expenditure for the week. Jonathan burns 3000 calories every day. Therefore, his caloric expenditure for the entire week is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total caloric expenditure} = 3000 \\text{ calories/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total caloric expenditure} = 21000 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the weekly caloric deficit by subtracting the total caloric intake from the total caloric expenditure:\n\\[\n\\text{Weekly caloric deficit} = \\text{Total caloric expenditure} - \\text{Total caloric intake}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Weekly caloric deficit} = 21000 \\text{ calories} - 18500 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Weekly caloric deficit} = 2500 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nThus, Jonathan's weekly caloric deficit is \\(\\boxed{2500}\\).",
