        "To determine the percentage of students who take music as their elective, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students who take music.\n2. Determine the percentage of students who take music based on the total number of students.\n\nFirst, we find the number of students who take music. We know the total number of students is 400. The number of students who take dance is 120, and the number of students who take art is 200. Therefore, the number of students who take music is:\n\n\\[\n400 - 120 - 200 = 80\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find what percentage 80 students is of the total 400 students. We do this by dividing the number of students who take music by the total number of students and then multiplying by 100:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{80}{400} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.2 \\times 100 = 20\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the percentage of students who take music is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",
