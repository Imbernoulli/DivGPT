        "To determine how many miles Milo can run in two hours, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Cory's wheelchair speed and use it to find Milo's skateboard speed.\n2. Use Milo's skateboard speed to find his running speed.\n3. Calculate how many miles Milo can run in two hours.\n\nFirst, we know that Cory drives his wheelchair at 12 miles per hour. Since Cory's wheelchair speed is twice the speed that Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard, we can find Milo's skateboard speed by dividing Cory's speed by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Milo's skateboard speed} = \\frac{12 \\text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 6 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Milo's skateboard speed is twice his running speed. Therefore, we can find Milo's running speed by dividing his skateboard speed by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Milo's running speed} = \\frac{6 \\text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 3 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Milo's running speed is 3 miles per hour, we can calculate how many miles he can run in two hours by multiplying his running speed by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Milo's running distance in two hours} = 3 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of miles Milo can run in two hours is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
