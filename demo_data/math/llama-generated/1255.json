        "To determine the cost of one chair, we start by identifying the total amount Nadine spent and the cost of the table. Nadine spent a total of $56 and bought a table for $34. Therefore, the total cost of the two chairs is the total amount spent minus the cost of the table:\n\n\\[ 56 - 34 = 22 \\]\n\nSince Nadine bought two chairs and each chair cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the chairs by 2:\n\n\\[ 22 \\div 2 = 11 \\]\n\nThus, the cost of one chair is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
