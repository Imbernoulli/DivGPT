The regular size rubber ducks are $3.00 each and the large size rubber duck is $5.00 each.  All of the rubber ducks will be dropped into the river at the same time and the first duck that floats across the finish line wins.  They sold 221 regular size ducks and 185 large size ducks.  How much money did the city raise for charity?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total amount of money raised for charity, we need to calculate the revenue from the regular size rubber ducks and the revenue from the large size rubber ducks separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the revenue from the regular size rubber ducks. The regular size rubber ducks are sold at $3.00 each, and the city sold 221 regular size ducks. Therefore, the revenue from the regular size rubber ducks is:\n\\[\n221 \\times 3 = 663\n\\]\nThis means the city raised $663 from the regular size rubber ducks.\n\nNext, we calculate the revenue from the large size rubber ducks. The large size rubber ducks are sold at $5.00 each, and the city sold 185 large size ducks. Therefore, the revenue from the large size rubber ducks is:\n\\[\n185 \\times 5 = 925\n\\]\nThis means the city raised $925 from the large size rubber ducks.\n\nTo find the total amount of money raised for charity, we add the revenue from the regular size rubber ducks and the revenue from the large size rubber ducks:\n\\[\n663 + 925 = 1588\n\\]\nTherefore, the city raised \\(\\boxed{1588}\\) dollars for charity.",
