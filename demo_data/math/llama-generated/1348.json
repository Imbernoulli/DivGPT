Since there are 80 students in total, we can find the number of half-day students by multiplying 80 by 25%.\n\n\\[ 25\\% = \\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \\]\n\nSo, the number of half-day students is:\n\n\\[ 80 \\times 0.25 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of half-day students from the total number of students to find the number of full-day students:\n\n\\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of full-day students is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",

To find the number of full-day students, we subtract the number of half-day students from the total number of students:\n\\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of full-day students is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
