        "To determine the total time Nicky waited at the DMV, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the times.\n\nFirst, we know that Nicky spent 20 minutes waiting to take a number.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the time he spent waiting for his number to be called. According to the problem, he waited four times the amount of time he spent waiting to take a number, plus an additional 14 minutes. So, we calculate this as follows:\n\\[ 4 \\times 20 + 14 = 80 + 14 = 94 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we add the time he spent waiting to take a number to the time he spent waiting for his number to be called:\n\\[ 20 + 94 = 114 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Nicky waited at the DMV is \\(\\boxed{114}\\).",
