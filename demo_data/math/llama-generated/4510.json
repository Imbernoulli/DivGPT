Therefore, we can calculate the diameter of the ash cloud as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Diameter of the ash cloud} = 18 \\times 300 = 5400 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the radius of the ash cloud. The radius is half of the diameter. So, we divide the diameter by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Radius of the ash cloud} = \\frac{5400}{2} = 2700 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThus, the radius of the ash cloud is \\(\\boxed{2700}\\) feet.",
