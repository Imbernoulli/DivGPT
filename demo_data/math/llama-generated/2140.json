Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of the computer**: The base computer costs $1500.\n\n2. **Cost of the monitor and other peripherals**: The monitor and other peripherals cost 1/5 of the base computer's cost. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of monitor and peripherals} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 1500 = 300\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of the upgraded video card**: The original video card costs $300, and John wants to upgrade to a video card that costs twice as much. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of upgraded video card} = 2 \\times 300 = 600\n   \\]\n   The cost of the original video card is $300, so the additional cost for the upgrade is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional cost for upgrade} = 600 - 300 = 300\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total cost**: Now, we add up the cost of the base computer, the monitor and other peripherals, and the additional cost for the upgrade:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 1500 + 300 + 300 = 2100\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount John spent is \\(\\boxed{2100}\\).",

        "To determine the total amount John spent on his new computer system, we need to add the cost of the computer, the monitor and peripherals, and the upgraded video card.

So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 300 = 600\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the upgraded video card costs $600. The cost of the upgrade is the difference between the upgraded video card and the base video card:\n   \\[\n   600 - 300 = 300\n   \\]\n   So, the upgrade cost $300.\n4. **Total cost**: To find the total amount John spent, we add the cost of the computer, the monitor and peripherals, and the upgrade cost:\n   \\[\n   1500 + 300 + 300 = 2100\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount John spent is \\(\\boxed{2100}\\).",
