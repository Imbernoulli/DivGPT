        "To determine the length of time between eating each peanut, we first need to calculate the total number of peanuts Uncle Lou has. Since he is given four bags and each bag contains 30 peanuts, we can find the total number of peanuts by multiplying the number of bags by the number of peanuts per bag:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ bags} \\times 30 \\text{ peanuts per bag} = 120 \\text{ peanuts}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total time Uncle Lou spends eating all the peanuts. The flight duration is 2 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the flight time into minutes:\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nUncle Lou eats all 120 peanuts over the course of 120 minutes. To find the length of time between eating each peanut, we divide the total time by the total number of peanuts:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120 \\text{ minutes}}{120 \\text{ peanuts}} = 1 \\text{ minute per peanut}\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of time between eating each peanut is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) minute.",

        "To determine the length of time between eating each peanut, we first need to calculate the total number of peanuts Uncle Lou has.

Since Uncle Lou eats all 120 peanuts over 120 minutes, and he eats one peanut at a time, the time between eating each peanut is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120 \\text{ minutes}}{120 \\text{ peanuts}} = 1 \\text{ minute per peanut}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the length of time between eating each peanut is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) minute.",

        "To determine the length of time between eating each peanut, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of peanuts Uncle Lou has.\n2. Determine the total time Uncle Lou spends eating the peanuts.\n3. Divide the total time by the total number of peanuts to find the time interval between each peanut.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of peanuts. Uncle Lou has four bags, and each bag contains 30 peanuts:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ bags} \\times 30 \\text{ peanuts per bag} = 120 \\text{ peanuts}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Uncle Lou spends 2 hours eating the peanuts. We need to convert this time into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 2 hours by 60 minutes per hour:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we divide the total time by the total number of peanuts to find the time interval between each peanut:\n\\[\n\\frac{120 \\text{ minutes}}{120 \\text{ peanuts}} = 1 \\text{ minute per peanut}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the length of time between eating each peanut is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) minute.",
