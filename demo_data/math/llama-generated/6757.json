        "To determine how much money the winner of the lottery will receive, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Lily earns from selling all 5 lottery tickets.\n2. Subtract the $4 profit Lily plans to keep from the total earnings to find out how much money will be given as the prize.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Lily earns from selling all 5 lottery tickets. She sells the first ticket for $1, the second ticket for $2, the third ticket for $3, the fourth ticket for $4, and the fifth ticket for $5. We can add these amounts together:\n\n\\[1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5\\]\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term \\(a = 1\\) and the common difference \\(d = 1\\). The sum \\(S_n\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d)\\]\n\nFor this series, \\(n = 5\\), \\(a = 1\\), and \\(d = 1\\). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[S_5 = \\frac{5}{2} (2 \\cdot 1 + (5-1) \\cdot 1) = \\frac{5}{2} (2 + 4) = \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot 6 = 15\\]\n\nSo, Lily earns a total of $15 from selling all 5 lottery tickets.\n\nNext, we subtract the $4 profit Lily plans to keep from the total earnings to find out how much money will be given as the prize:\n\n\\[15 - 4 = 11\\]\n\nTherefore, the winner of the lottery will receive \\(\\boxed{11}\\) dollars.",

Subtract the $4 profit Lily plans to keep from the total earnings to find out how much money will be given as the prize.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Lily earns from selling all the lottery tickets. She sells the first ticket for $1, the second ticket for $2, the third ticket for $3, the fourth ticket for $4, and the fifth ticket for $5. We can add these amounts together:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5\n\\]\n\nThis is an arithmetic series where the first term \\(a\\) is 1, the last term \\(l\\) is 5, and the number of terms \\(n\\) is 5. The sum \\(S_n\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\nS_5 = \\frac{5}{2} \\times (1 + 5) = \\frac{5}{2} \\times 6 = 15\n\\]\n\nSo, Lily earns a total of $15 from selling all the lottery tickets.\n\nNext, we subtract the $4 profit Lily plans to keep from the total earnings to find out how much money will be given as the prize:\n\n\\[\n15 - 4 = 11\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the winner of the lottery will receive \\(\\boxed{11}\\) dollars.",

Subtract Lily's $4 profit from the total earnings to find out how much money will be given as the prize.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Lily earns from selling the tickets. The price of each ticket is as follows:\n- The first ticket is $1.\n- The second ticket is $1 + $1 = $2.\n- The third ticket is $2 + $1 = $3.\n- The fourth ticket is $3 + $1 = $4.\n- The fifth ticket is $4 + $1 = $5.\n\nNow, we sum up the prices of all the tickets:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 \\]\n\nSo, Lily earns a total of $15 from selling all 5 lottery tickets.\n\nNext, we subtract Lily's $4 profit from the total earnings to find out how much money will be given as the prize:\n\\[ 15 - 4 = 11 \\]\n\nTherefore, the winner of the lottery will receive \\(\\boxed{11}\\) dollars.",
