        "To determine the total number of times Georgia and Robert have coughed after 20 minutes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of times Georgia coughs in one minute.\n2. Determine the number of times Robert coughs in one minute.\n3. Calculate the total number of times Georgia coughs in 20 minutes.\n4. Calculate the total number of times Robert coughs in 20 minutes.\n5. Add the total number of times Georgia and Robert coughs to get the final answer.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Georgia coughs 5 times a minute.\n\n2. Robert coughs twice as much as Georgia. Therefore, the number of times Robert coughs in one minute is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\n3. To find out how many times Georgia coughs in 20 minutes, we multiply the number of times she coughs in one minute by 20:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 20 = 100 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\n4. To find out how many times Robert coughs in 20 minutes, we multiply the number of times he coughs in one minute by 20:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 20 = 200 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\n5.Finally, we add the total number of times Georgia and Robert coughs to get the final answer:\n   \\[\n   100 + 200 = 300\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of times Georgia and Robert have coughed after 20 minutes is \\boxed{300}.",

Since she coughs 5 times a minute, we multiply her coughing rate by 20:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ times/minute} \\times 20 \\text{ minutes} = 100 \\text{ times} \\]\n\nSimilarly, we calculate the total number of times Robert coughs in 20 minutes. Since he coughs 10 times a minute, we multiply his coughing rate by 20:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ times/minute} \\times 20 \\text{ minutes} = 200 \\text{ times} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total number of times Georgia coughs to the total number of times Robert coughs to find the overall total:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ times} + 200 \\text{ times} = 300 \\text{ times} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of times Georgia and Robert have coughed after 20 minutes is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
