        "To determine how many pencils Harry has left, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, find out how many pencils Harry initially had. Since Harry has twice the number of Anna's pencils, and Anna has 50 pencils, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 50 = 100\n   \\]\n   So, Harry initially had 100 pencils.\n\n2. Next, we need to account for the pencils Harry lost. Harry lost 19 pencils, so we subtract 19 from the initial number of pencils he had:\n   \\[\n   100 - 19 = 81\n   \\]\n   So, after losing 19 pencils, Harry has 81 pencils left.\n\nTherefore, the number of pencils left with Harry is \\(\\boxed{81}\\).",

Subtract the number of pencils Harry lost from his initial number.\n\nFirst, we find out how many pencils Harry initially has. Anna has 50 pencils, and Harry has twice the number of Anna's pencils. Therefore, we multiply Anna's number of pencils by 2:\n\\[ 50 \\times 2 = 100 \\]\nSo, Harry initially has 100 pencils.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of pencils Harry lost from his initial number. Harry lost 19 pencils, so we subtract 19 from 100:\n\\[ 100 - 19 = 81 \\]\nSo, the number of pencils left with Harry is \\(\\boxed{81}\\).",
