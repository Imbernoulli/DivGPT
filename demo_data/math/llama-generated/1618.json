        "To determine how many chocolate bars and soda cans Kayla bought, we start by analyzing the information given about Theresa's purchases. Theresa bought twice the number of chocolate bars and soda cans that Kayla bought.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many chocolate bars Kayla bought. Since Theresa bought 12 chocolate bars and she bought twice as many as Kayla, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\text{Number of chocolate bars Kayla bought} = \\frac{\\text{Number of chocolate bars Theresa bought}}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many soda cans Kayla bought. Since Theresa bought 18 soda cans and she bought twice as many as Kayla, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\text{Number of soda cans Kayla bought} = \\frac{\\text{Number of soda cans Theresa bought}}{2} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of chocolate bars and soda cans Kayla bought by adding the number of chocolate bars and the number of soda cans:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of chocolate bars and soda cans Kayla bought} = 6 + 9 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of chocolate bars and soda cans Kayla bought is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",

Since Theresa bought twice as many chocolate bars as Kayla, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 2 \\times \\text{(number of chocolate bars Kayla bought)} = 12 \\]\nTo find the number of chocolate bars Kayla bought, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ \\text{(number of chocolate bars Kayla bought)} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many soda cans Kayla bought. Since Theresa bought twice as many soda cans as Kayla, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 2 \\times \\text{(number of soda cans Kayla bought)} = 18 \\]\nTo find the number of soda cans Kayla bought, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ \\text{(number of soda cans Kayla bought)} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of chocolate bars and soda cans Kayla bought. We do this by adding the number of chocolate bars and the number of soda cans:\n\\[ \\text{(total number of chocolate bars and soda cans Kayla bought)} = 6 + 9 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of chocolate bars and soda cans Kayla bought is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
