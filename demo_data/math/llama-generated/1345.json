Use the given relationship to calculate the depth at which Northton buries their time capsule.\n\nFirst, we know that Southton buries their time capsule 15 feet underground. So, the depth of Southton's time capsule is 15 feet.\n\nNext, we are given that Northton buries their time capsule 12 feet higher than 4 times the depth of the Southton time capsule. We can express this relationship mathematically as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Depth of Northton's time capsule} = 4 \\times \\text{Depth of Southton's time capsule} - 12 \\]\n\nSubstituting the depth of Southton's time capsule into the equation, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Depth of Northton's time capsule} = 4 \\times 15 - 12 \\]\n\nNow, we perform the multiplication:\n\\[ 4 \\times 15 = 60 \\]\n\nThen, we subtract 12 from 60:\n\\[ 60 - 12 = 48 \\]\n\nTherefore, the depth at which Northton buries their time capsule is \\(\\boxed{48}\\) feet.",

        "To determine the depth at which Northton buries their time capsule, we start by identifying the depth of Southton's time capsule. According to the problem, Southton buries their time capsule 15 feet underground.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the depth of Northton's time capsule.

First, we find 4 times the depth of Southton's time capsule:\n\\[\n4 \\times 15 = 60\n\\]\nThis means that Northton buries their time capsule 60 feet underground, but 12 feet higher than this depth. Therefore, we add 12 feet to 60 feet:\n\\[\n60 - 12 = 48\n\\]\nSo, Northton buries their time capsule 48 feet underground.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{48}\n\\]",

        "To determine how deep Northton's time capsule is buried, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the depth at which Southton's time capsule is buried.\n2. Use the given relationship to find the depth at which Northton's time capsule is buried.\n\nFirst, we know that Southton buries their time capsule 15 feet underground. This means the depth of the Southton time capsule is 15 feet.\n\nNext, we are given that Northton buries their time capsule 12 feet higher than 4 times the depth of the Southton time capsule. We can express this relationship mathematically as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Depth of Northton's time capsule} = 4 \\times \\text{Depth of Southton's time capsule} - 12\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the depth of Southton's time capsule (which is 15 feet) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Depth of Northton's time capsule} = 4 \\times 15 - 12\n\\]\n\nNow, we perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 15 = 60\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Depth of Northton's time capsule} = 60 - 12\n\\]\n\nFinally, we perform the subtraction:\n\n\\[\n60 - 12 = 48\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the depth at which Northton's time capsule is buried is \\boxed{48} feet.",

We can express this relationship mathematically as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Depth of Northton's time capsule} = 4 \\times \\text{Depth of Southton's time capsule} - 12\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the depth of Southton's time capsule into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Depth of Northton's time capsule} = 4 \\times 15 - 12\n\\]\n\nNow, we perform the multiplication and subtraction:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Depth of Northton's time capsule} = 60 - 12 = 48\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the depth at which Northton buries their time capsule is \\boxed{48} feet.",
        "To determine the depth at which Northton buries their time capsule, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the depth at which Southton buries their time capsule.\n2.
