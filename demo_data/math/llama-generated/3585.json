        "To determine how many episodes Cesar has left to watch, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of episodes in the series.\n2. Determine how many episodes Cesar has already watched.\n3. Subtract the number of episodes Cesar has watched from the total number of episodes to find out how many episodes are remaining.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of episodes in the series. The series has 12 seasons, and each season has 20 episodes:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ seasons} \\times 20 \\text{ episodes/season} = 240 \\text{ episodes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many episodes Cesar has already watched. Cesar watched \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the series:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 240 \\text{ episodes} = 80 \\text{ episodes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of episodes Cesar has watched from the total number of episodes to find out how many episodes are remaining:\n\\[\n240 \\text{ episodes} - 80 \\text{ episodes} = 160 \\text{ episodes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of episodes remaining for Cesar to finish the series is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
