Add the weekly distances of Onur and Hanil.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the distance Onur bikes in one day.**\nOnur bikes 250 kilometers a day.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the distance Onur bikes in a week.**\nOnur bikes 5 days a week, so we multiply the daily distance by 5:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ km/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 1250 \\text{ km/week} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the distance Hanil bikes in one day.**\nHanil bikes 40 kilometers more than Onur each day. Since Onur bikes 250 kilometers a day, Hanil bikes:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ km/day} + 40 \\text{ km/day} = 290 \\text{ km/day} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the distance Hanil bikes in a week.**\nHanil bikes 5 days a week, so we multiply the daily distance by 5:\n\\[ 290 \\text{ km/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 1450 \\text{ km/week} \\]\n\n**Step 5: Add the weekly distances of Onur and Hanil.**\nTo find the total distance both friends bike in a week, we add Onur's weekly distance to Hanil's weekly distance:\n\\[ 1250 \\text{ km/week} + 1450 \\text{ km/week} = 2700 \\text{ km/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance the two friends bikes in a week is \\(\\boxed{2700}\\).",

Add the weekly biking distances of Onur and Hanil to get the total weekly distance.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily biking distance for Hanil. Onur bikes 250 kilometers a day, and Hanil bikes 40 more kilometers than Onur each day. Therefore, Hanil's daily biking distance is:\n\\[ 250 + 40 = 290 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the weekly biking distance for Onur. Onur bikes 250 kilometers a day, and he does this 5 days a week.
