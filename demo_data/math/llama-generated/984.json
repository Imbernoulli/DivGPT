        "To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to purchase the $4640 car, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then divide the cost of the car by her weekly earnings.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Janet's weekly earnings. Janet works 52 hours per week, and any hours over 40 are considered overtime. So, she works 40 regular hours and 12 overtime hours.\n\nThe regular hourly wage is $20, so the earnings from regular hours are:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$20/\\text{hour} = \\$800 \\]\n\nThe overtime hourly wage is 1.5 times the regular hourly wage, which is:\n\\[ 1.5 \\times \\$20/\\text{hour} = \\$30/\\text{hour} \\]\nSo, the earnings from overtime hours are:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$30/\\text{hour} = \\$360 \\]\n\nAdding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives Janet's total weekly earnings:\n\\[ \\$800 + \\$360 = \\$1160 \\]\n\nNow, to find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to purchase the $4640 car, we divide the cost of the car by her weekly earnings:\n\\[ \\frac{\\$4640}{\\$1160/\\text{week}} = 4 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nTherefore, Janet needs to work \\(\\boxed{4}\\) weeks to purchase the car.",
