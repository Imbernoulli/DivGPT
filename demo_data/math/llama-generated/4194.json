        "To determine how much money Josh had initially, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total amount of money Josh spent.\n2. Add the amount of money he spent to the amount of money he has left.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Josh spent. He spent $1.75 on a drink and then spent another $1.25. So, the total amount spent is:\n\\[ 1.75 + 1.25 = 3.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we know that after spending this money, Josh has $6 left. Therefore, the amount of money Josh had initially is the sum of the money he spent and the money he has left:\n\\[ 3.00 + 6.00 = 9.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money Josh had at first is:\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]",

Calculate the initial amount of money Josh had by adding the total amount spent to the amount of money he has left.\n   - If Josh has $6 left after spending $3.00, then the initial amount of money he had is:\n     \\[\n     6 + 3.00 = 9.00\n     \\]\n\nSo, the initial amount of money Josh had is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
        "Let's denote the amount of money Josh had initially as \\( x \\) dollars.\n\nFirst, Josh spent $1.75 on a drink. So, after this purchase, the amount of money he had left is:\n\\[ x - 1.75 \\]\n\nNext, Josh spent another $1.25. So, after this second purchase, the amount of money he had left is:\n\\[ (x - 1.75) - 1.25 = x - 1.75 - 1.25 = x - 3.00 \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, after these two purchases, Josh had $6 left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ x - 3.00 = 6 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we need to isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by adding $3.00 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x - 3.00 + 3.00 = 6 + 3.00 \\]\n\\[ x = 9 \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money Josh had at first is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."
