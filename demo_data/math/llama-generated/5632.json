        "To determine how much money James made from selling all the water, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of water collected on Monday.\n2. Calculate the total amount of water collected on Tuesday.\n3. Add the amounts of water collected on both days to get the total amount of water collected.\n4. Multiply the total amount of water collected by the price per gallon to get the total amount of money made.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of water collected on Monday:**\n   - On Monday, it rained 4 inches.\n   - For each inch of rain, James collects 15 gallons.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Water collected on Monday} = 4 \\text{ inches} \\times 15 \\text{ gallons per inch} = 60 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of water collected on Tuesday:**\n   - On Tuesday, it rained 3 inches.\n   - For each inch of rain, James collects 15 gallons.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Water collected on Tuesday} = 3 \\text{ inches} \\times 15 \\text{ gallons per inch} = 45 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add the amounts of water collected on both days:**\n   - Water collected on Monday: 60 gallons\n   - Water collected on Tuesday: 45 gallons\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total water collected} = 60 \\text{ gallons} + 45 \\text{ gallons} = 105 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the total amount of water collected by the price per gallon:**\n   - Total water collected: 105 gallons\n   - Price per gallon: $1.2\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total money made} = 105 \\text{ gallons} \\times 1.2 \\text{ dollars per gallon} = 126 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money James made from selling all the water is \\(\\boxed{126}\\).",

Multiply the total amount of water collected by the price per gallon to find out how much money James made.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of water collected on Monday.\n   - It rained 4 inches on Monday.\n   - For each inch of rain, James collects 15 gallons.\n   - Therefore, the total amount of water collected on Monday is \\(4 \\times 15 = 60\\) gallons.\n\n2. Calculate the total amount of water collected on Tuesday.\n   - It rained 3 inches on Tuesday.\n   - For each inch of rain, James collects 15 gallons.\n   - Therefore, the total amount of water collected on Tuesday is \\(3 \\times 15 = 45\\) gallons.\n\n3. Add the amounts of water collected on both days to get the total amount of water collected.\n   - The total amount of water collected is \\(60 + 45 = 105\\) gallons.\n\n4.
