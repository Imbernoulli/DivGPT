        "To determine how many delegates were not wearing name badges, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of delegates who did not arrive with pre-printed name badges.\n   \\[\n   36 - 16 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, 20 delegates did not arrive with pre-printed name badges.\n\n2. Determine how many of these 20 delegates made their own hand-written name badges.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n   \\]\n   So, 10 delegates made their own hand-written name badges.\n\n3. Calculate the number of delegates who did not wear any name badges by subtracting the number of delegates who made their own hand-written name badges from the number of delegates who did not arrive with pre-printed name badges.\n   \\[\n   20 - 10 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, 10 delegates were not wearing name badges.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many delegates were not wearing name badges, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.

Determine how many of these delegates made their own hand-written name badges.\n4. Calculate the number of delegates who did not wear any name badges.\n\nFirst, we know the total number of delegates is 36 and the number of delegates who arrived with pre-printed name badges is 16. Therefore, the number of delegates who did not arrive with pre-printed name badges is:\n\\[ 36 - 16 = 20. \\]\n\nNext, half of the remaining delegates made their own hand-written name badges. So, the number of delegates who made their own hand-written name badges is:\n\\[ \\frac{20}{2} = 10. \\]\n\nThis means that the number of delegates who did not wear any name badges is:\n\\[ 20 - 10 = 10. \\]\n\nThus, the number of delegates who were not wearing name badges is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

So, the number of delegates who made their own hand-written name badges is:\n\\[ \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\]\n\nThis means that the number of delegates who did not wear any name badges is the remaining number of delegates after those who made their own hand-written name badges are subtracted from the 20 delegates who did not arrive with pre-printed name badges:\n\\[ 20 - 10 = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the number of delegates who were not wearing name badges is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",

Find out how many delegates did not wear any name badges.\n\nFirst, we know there are 36 delegates in total and 16 of them arrived with pre-printed name badges. Therefore, the number of delegates who did not arrive with pre-printed name badges is:\n\\[ 36 - 16 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that half of the remaining delegates made their own hand-written name badges. So, the number of delegates who made their own hand-written name badges is:\n\\[ \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\]\n\nThis means that the number of delegates who did not wear any name badges is the remaining number of delegates after those who made their own hand-written name badges:\n\\[ 20 - 10 = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the number of delegates who were not wearing name badges is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",
        "To determine how many delegates were not wearing name badges, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of delegates who did not arrive with pre-printed name badges.\n2.

Find out how many delegates did not have any name badges.\n\nFirst, we find out how many delegates did not arrive with pre-printed name badges. There are 36 delegates in total and 16 of them arrived with pre-printed name badges:\n\\[ 36 - 16 = 20 \\]\nSo, 20 delegates did not arrive with pre-printed name badges.\n\nNext, we determine how many of these 20 delegates made their own hand-written name badges.

Since 10 delegates made their own hand-written name badges, the number of delegates who did not have any name badges is:\n\\[ 20 - 10 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of delegates who were not wearing name badges is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
