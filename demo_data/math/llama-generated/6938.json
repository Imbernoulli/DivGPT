        "To determine how many grams of sugar the company will use in two minutes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of sugar needed to produce one chocolate bar.\n2. Determine how many chocolate bars the company produces in one minute.\n3. Calculate the amount of sugar used in one minute.\n4. Calculate the amount of sugar used in two minutes.\n\nFirst, we know that each chocolate bar requires 1.5 grams of sugar. The company produces 36 chocolate bars every minute. Therefore, the amount of sugar used in one minute is:\n\\[ 1.5 \\text{ grams/bar} \\times 36 \\text{ bars/minute} = 54 \\text{ grams/minute} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much sugar is used in two minutes. Since the company uses 54 grams of sugar each minute, in two minutes it will use:\n\\[ 54 \\text{ grams/minute} \\times 2 \\text{ minutes} = 108 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\nThus, the company will use \\(\\boxed{108}\\) grams of sugar in two minutes.",
        "To determine how many grams of sugar the company will use in two minutes, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of sugar needed for one chocolate bar:**\n   The company requires 1.5 grams of sugar for each chocolate bar.\n\n2. **Calculate the amount of sugar needed for 36 chocolate bars in one minute:**\n   Since the company produces 36 chocolate bars every minute, we multiply the amount of sugar per chocolate bar by the number of chocolate bars produced in one minute:\n   \\[\n   1.5 \\text{ grams/bar} \\times 36 \\text{ bars/minute} = 54 \\text{ grams/minute}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the amount of sugar needed for two minutes:**\n   To find out how much sugar is needed for two minutes, we multiply the amount of sugar needed for one minute by 2:\n   \\[\n   54 \\text{ grams/minute} \\times 2 \\text{ minutes} = 108 \\text{ grams}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the company will use \\(\\boxed{108}\\) grams of sugar in two minutes.",
