        "To determine how many bottles of wine remain in Jose's cellar after the party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of bottles of domestic wine.\n2. Find the total number of bottles of wine.\n3. Determine how many bottles are consumed during the party.\n4. Calculate the number of bottles remaining after the party.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of bottles of domestic wine. Since Jose has half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Number of bottles of domestic wine} = \\frac{2400}{2} = 1200 \\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of bottles of wine in the cellar:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of bottles} = 2400 + 1200 = 3600 \\]\n\nThen, we determine how many bottles are consumed during the party. Since the guests drink one-third of all the wine, we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Bottles consumed} = \\frac{3600}{3} = 1200 \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of bottles remaining after the party:\n\\[ \\text{Bottles remaining} = 3600 - 1200 = 2400 \\]\n\nThus, the number of bottles that will remain in Jose's cellar is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]",

Since he has 2400 bottles of imported wine, the number of domestic wine bottles is:\n\\[ \\frac{2400}{2} = 1200 \\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of wine bottles before the party by adding the number of imported wine bottles and the number of domestic wine bottles:\n\\[ 2400 + 1200 = 3600 \\]\n\nNow, we determine how many bottles are consumed during the party. The guests drink one-third of all the wine. Therefore, the number of bottles consumed is:\n\\[ \\frac{3600}{3} = 1200 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of consumed bottles from the total number of bottles before the party to find out how many bottles remain in the cellar:\n\\[ 3600 - 1200 = 2400 \\]\n\nThus, the number of bottles that will remain in Jose's cellar is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2400} \\]",

Calculate the number of bottles remaining after the party.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of bottles of domestic wine. Jose holds half as many bottles of domestic wine as imported wine. Since he has 2400 bottles of imported wine, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of domestic wine bottles} = \\frac{2400}{2} = 1200\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of bottles of wine by adding the number of imported wine bottles and the number of domestic wine bottles:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of wine bottles} = 2400 + 1200 = 3600\n\\]\n\nNow, we determine how many bottles are consumed during the party. The guests drink one-third of all the wine:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of bottles consumed} = \\frac{3600}{3} = 1200\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of bottles remaining after the party by subtracting the number of bottles consumed from the total number of bottles:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of bottles remaining} = 3600 - 1200 = 2400\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of bottles that will remain in Jose's cellar is \\(\\boxed{2400}\\).",
