        "To determine how many fruits Karlee is left with after giving some to her friends, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of strawberries Karlee has.\n   Karlee has \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) as many strawberries as grapes. Since she has 100 grapes, the number of strawberries is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{5} \\times 100 = 60\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine how many grapes Karlee gives to each friend.\n   Karlee gives each friend \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of her grapes. Therefore, the number of grapes given to each friend is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times 100 = 20\n   \\]\n   Since she has two friends, the total number of grapes given away is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 2 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, the number of grapes Karlee has left is:\n   \\[\n   100 - 40 = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. Determine how many strawberries Karlee gives to each friend.\n   Karlee gives each friend \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of her strawberries. Therefore, the number of strawberries given to each friend is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times 60 = 12\n   \\]\n   Since she has two friends, the total number of strawberries given away is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 2 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, the number of strawberries Karlee has left is:\n   \\[\n   60 - 24 = 36\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the total number of fruits Karlee has left.\n   The total number of fruits Karlee has left is the sum of the grapes and strawberries she has left:\n   \\[\n   60 + 36 = 96\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits Karlee is left with is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
