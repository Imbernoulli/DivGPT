Add the cost of the piano to the discounted cost of the lessons.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The cost of the piano is $500.\n2. The cost of the lessons before the discount is calculated by multiplying the number of lessons by the cost per lesson:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ lessons} \\times \\$40 \\text{ per lesson} = \\$800\n   \\]\n3. The discount on the lessons is 25% of $800. To find the discount, we multiply $800 by 0.25:\n   \\[\n   \\$800 \\times 0.25 = \\$200\n   \\]\n4. The discounted cost of the lessons is the original cost minus the discount:\n   \\[\n   \\$800 - \\$200 = \\$600\n   \\]\n5. The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of the piano and the discounted cost of the lessons:\n   \\[\n   \\$500 + \\$600 = \\$1100\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of everything is \\(\\boxed{1100}\\).",

So, the total cost of the lessons before the discount is:\n\\[\n20 \\times 40 = 800 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we apply the 25% discount to the cost of the lessons.
