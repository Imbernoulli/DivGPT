        "To determine the total cost of the shirts and pants that James bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of pants James bought:**\n   James buys 10 shirts and half as many pants. Therefore, the number of pants is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the shirts:**\n   Each shirt costs $6, and James buys 10 shirts. So, the total cost for the shirts is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 6 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the pants:**\n   Each pair of pants costs $8, and James buys 5 pairs. So, the total cost for the pants is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 8 = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of everything:**\n   Add the total cost of the shirts and the total cost of the pants:\n   \\[\n   60 + 40 = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of everything is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
