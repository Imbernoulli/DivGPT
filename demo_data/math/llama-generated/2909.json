        "To determine the total time Joan took to travel to her family's house, we need to consider both the time spent driving and the time spent on her breaks.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time spent driving.

The time spent driving is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent driving} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{480 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ mph}} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total time spent on her breaks. Joan takes a lunch break of 30 minutes and two bathroom breaks, each taking 15 minutes. The total time spent on breaks is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time spent on breaks} = 30 \\text{ minutes} + 15 \\text{ minutes} + 15 \\text{ minutes} = 60 \\text{ minutes} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the time spent driving and the total time spent on breaks to find the total travel time:\n\\[\n\\text{Total travel time} = 8 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 9 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it took Joan to get to her family's house is \\boxed{9}.",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the driving time:**\n   Joan drives at a rate of 60 miles per hour. The distance to her family is 480 miles. The time taken to drive this distance is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Driving time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{480 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ mph}} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total break time:**\n   Joan takes a lunch break of 30 minutes and two bathroom breaks of 15 minutes each. First, convert all break times to hours:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lunch break} = \\frac{30 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes per hour}} = 0.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Each bathroom break} = \\frac{15 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes per hour}} = 0.25 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   Since there are two bathroom breaks, the total time for bathroom breaks is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total bathroom break time} = 2 \\times 0.25 \\text{ hours} = 0.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   Adding up all the break times gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total break time} = 0.5 \\text{ hours} + 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total travel time:**\n   The total travel time is the sum of the driving time and the total break time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total travel time} = 8 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 9 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it took Joan to get to her family is \\(\\boxed{9}\\) hours.",
