        "To determine how many books the library sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of books remaining after the sale:**\n\n   The library originally has 9,900 books. According to the problem, four sixths of the books are left. First, we simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{4}{6}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, we find \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of 9,900:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times 9,900\n   \\]\n\n   To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator of the fraction by the whole number and then divide by the denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2 \\times 9,900}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   First, calculate \\(2 \\times 9,900\\):\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 9,900 = 19,800\n   \\]\n\n   Next, divide 19,800 by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{19,800}{3} = 6,600\n   \\]\n\n   So, the number of books remaining after the sale is 6,600.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of books sold:**\n\n   To find out how many books were sold, subtract the number of books remaining from the original number of books:\n   \\[\n   9,900 - 6,600\n   \\]\n\n   Perform the subtraction:\n   \\[\n   9,900 - 6,600 = 3,300\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the number of books sold is \\(\\boxed{3300}\\).",
        "To determine how many books the library sold over the summer, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of books remaining after the sale.\n2. Subtract the number of remaining books from the original number of books to find out how many books were sold.\n\nFirst, we know that four sixths of the books are left. This can be simplified to two thirds:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many books correspond to two thirds of the original 9,900 books.
