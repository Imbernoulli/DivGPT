        "To determine the total points James earned, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the points for correct answers:**\n   - Each round consists of 5 questions.\n   - James missed 1 question, so he answered \\(5 - 1 = 4\\) questions correctly in total.\n   - There are 5 rounds, so the total number of correct answers is \\(4 \\text{ questions/round} \\times 5 \\text{ rounds} = 25 \\text{ questions}\\).\n   - Each correct answer earns 2 points, so the points from correct answers is \\(25 \\text{ questions} \\times 2 \\text{ points/question} = 50 \\text{ points}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the bonus points:**\n   - James missed 1 question, which means he did not answer all the questions correctly in one round.\n   - Therefore, he did answer all the questions correctly in \\(5 - 1 = 4\\) rounds.\n   - Each round with all correct answers earns a 4-point bonus, so the total bonus points is \\(4 \\text{ rounds} \\times 4 \\text{ points/round} = 16 \\text{ points}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the total points:**\n   - The total points James earned is the sum of the points from correct answers and the bonus points, which is \\(50 \\text{ points} + 16 \\text{ points} = 66 \\text{ points}\\).\n\nThus, the total number of points James got is \\(\\boxed{66}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of points James earned, we need to break down the scoring step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the points James earns from the correct answers. Since each round has 5 questions and James missed only one question, he answered \\(5 - 1 = 4\\) questions correctly in total. The quiz bowl consists of 5 rounds, so the total number of correct answers is:\n\\[4 \\text{ questions/round} \\times 5 \\text{ rounds} = 25 \\text{ questions}\\]\nSince James answered 25 questions correctly, he earns:\n\\[25 \\text{ questions} \\times 2 \\text{ points/question} = 50 \\text{ points}\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many rounds James answered all the questions correctly. Since he missed only one question, he could not have missed any questions in any of the other rounds. Therefore, he answered all the questions correctly in 4 out of the 5 rounds. For each round he answered all the questions correctly, he earns an additional 4-point bonus. So, the total bonus points he earns is:\n\\[4 \\text{ rounds} \\times 4 \\text{ points/round} = 16 \\text{ points}\\]\n\nAdding the points from the correct answers and the bonus points, we get:\n\\[50 \\text{ points} + 16 \\text{ points} = 66 \\text{ points}\\]\n\nThus, the total number of points James earned is:\n\\[\\boxed{66}\\]",
