        "To determine how much cash Milo gets, we first need to calculate his average grade. We start by finding the total sum of his grades and then divide that sum by the total number of grades.\n\nMilo's grades are three 2s, four 3s, one 4, and one 5. We can express the sum of his grades as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\times 2 + 4 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 4 + 1 \\times 5\n\\]\nCalculating each term separately, we get:\n\\[\n3 \\times 2 = 6\n\\]\n\\[\n4 \\times 3 = 12\n\\]\n\\[\n1 \\times 4 = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n1 \\times 5 = 5\n\\]\nAdding these values together gives us the total sum of his grades:\n\\[\n6 + 12 + 4 + 5 = 27\n\\]\nNext, we count the total number of grades. Milo has three 2s, four 3s, one 4, and one 5, which adds up to:\n\\[\n3 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9\n\\]\nNow, we find the average grade by dividing the total sum of the grades by the total number of grades:\n\\[\n\\frac{27}{9} = 3\n\\]\nAccording to the problem, Milo will get $5 times his average grade. Therefore, we multiply his average grade by 5:\n\\[\n5 \\times 3 = 15\n\\]\nThus, the amount of cash Milo gets is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]",

He has three 2s, four 3s, one 4, and one 5, which totals to:\n\\[\n3 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the average grade by dividing the total sum of the grades by the number of grades:\n\\[\n\\text{Average grade} = \\frac{27}{9} = 3\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the cash reward by multiplying the average grade by $5:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash reward} = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cash reward Milo gets is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
