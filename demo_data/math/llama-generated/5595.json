Since he takes a loan for 75% of the cost of the new house, he pays 25% of the cost of the new house with the money he got from selling his first house. So, we can write:\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 500,000 = 1.25x \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 500,000 = 125,000 \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ 125,000 = 1.25x \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.25:\n\\[ x = \\frac{125,000}{1.25} = 100,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the price Tommy bought his first house for is:\n\\[ \\boxed{100000} \\]",
