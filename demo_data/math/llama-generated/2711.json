        "To determine the total number of steps Eliana walked over the three days, we need to break down her daily exercise routine and then sum up the steps.\n\n**Day 1:**\n- Eliana walked 200 steps.\n- She did some press-ups, but press-ups do not add to the step count.\n- She added 300 more steps.\n\nSo, the total number of steps on Day 1 is:\n\\[\n200 + 300 = 500 \\text{ steps}\n\\]\n\n**Day 2:**\n- Eliana walked twice the number of steps she walked on Day 1.\n\nThe number of steps on Day 2 is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 500 = 1000 \\text{ steps}\n\\]\n\n**Day 3:**\n- Eliana walked an additional 100 steps.\n\nSince we are not given any other exercise activities on Day 3, the total number of steps on Day 3 is:\n\\[\n100 \\text{ steps}\n\\]\n\n**Total Steps Over Three Days:**\nTo find the total number of steps over the three days, we sum up the steps from each day:\n\\[\n500 + 1000 + 100 = 1600 \\text{ steps}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1600}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of steps Eliana walked over the three days, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of steps Eliana walked on the first day. She walked 200 steps in the morning, did some press-ups (which we don't need to count as steps), and then added 300 more steps later. So, the total number of steps on the first day is:\n\\[ 200 + 300 = 500 \\text{ steps} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of steps Eliana walked on the second day. She walked twice the number of steps she walked on the first day. Since she walked 500 steps on the first day, the total number of steps on the second day is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 500 = 1000 \\text{ steps} \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of steps Eliana walked on the third day. She walked an additional 100 steps. Since we don't have the breakdown of her steps on the third day, we assume she only walked these 100 steps. Therefore, the total number of steps on the third day is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ steps} \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the steps from all three days to find the total number of steps Eliana walked:\n\\[ 500 + 1000 + 100 = 1600 \\text{ steps} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1600} \\]",

The problem states that she walked an additional 100 steps. Since she didn't specify the number of steps she walked on the third day before adding the 100 steps, we can assume she walked 0 steps the day before adding the 100 steps. Therefore, the total number of steps she walked on the third day is:\n\\[0 + 100 = 100\\]\n\nNow, let's find the total number of steps Eliana walked over the three days by adding the steps from each day:\n\\[500 + 1000 + 100 = 1600\\]\n\nSo, the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days is:\n\\[\\boxed{1600}\\]",
