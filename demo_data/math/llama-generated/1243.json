        "To determine the total number of cans of food Carla needs for a quadruple batch of chili, we start by calculating the number of cans of each type of food required for a normal batch.\n\n1. **Chilis**: Carla adds 1 can of chilis to a normal batch.\n2. **Beans**: Carla adds 2 cans of beans to a normal batch.\n3. **Tomatoes**: Carla adds 50% more tomatoes than beans. Since she adds 2 cans of beans, she adds \\(2 + 0.5 \\times 2 = 2 + 1 = 3\\) cans of tomatoes to a normal batch.\n\nNext, we sum the total number of cans for a normal batch:\n\\[1 \\text{ (chilis)} + 2 \\text{ (beans)} + 3 \\text{ (tomatoes)} = 6 \\text{ cans}\\]\n\nSince Carla is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the total number of cans for a normal batch by 4:\n\\[6 \\text{ cans} \\times 4 = 24 \\text{ cans}\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cans of food Carla needs is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of cans of food Carla needs for a quadruple batch of chili, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of cans of each ingredient for a normal batch:**\n   - Chilis: 1 can\n   - Beans: 2 cans\n   - Tomatoes: 50% more than beans\n\n   First, calculate 50% of the beans:\n   \\[\n   50\\% \\text{ of 2 cans} = 0.5 \\times 2 = 1 \\text{ can}\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ cans} + 1 \\text{ can} = 3 \\text{ cans}\n   \\]\n\n   So, for a normal batch, Carla uses:\n   - 1 can of chilis\n   - 2 cans of beans\n   - 3 cans of tomatoes\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of cans for a normal batch:**\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ can of chilis} + 2 \\text{ cans of beans} + 3 \\text{ cans of tomatoes} = 6 \\text{ cans}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total number of cans for a quadruple batch:**\n   Since a quadruple batch is four times a normal batch, we multiply the total number of cans for a normal batch by 4:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ cans} \\times 4 = 24 \\text{ cans}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cans of food Carla needs for a quadruple batch is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
