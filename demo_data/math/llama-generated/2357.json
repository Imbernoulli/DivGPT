        "To determine the total number of envelopes Wyatt has, we start by calculating the number of yellow envelopes he has. We know that Wyatt has 10 blue envelopes and 4 fewer yellow envelopes than blue envelopes. Therefore, the number of yellow envelopes is:\n\n\\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of blue envelopes and the number of yellow envelopes to find the total number of envelopes Wyatt has:\n\n\\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of envelopes Wyatt has is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
