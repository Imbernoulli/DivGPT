        "To determine how much faster Timmy has to go than his average speed to make it up the ramp, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the average speed from the three trial runs.\n2. Determine the difference between the required speed and the average speed.\n\nFirst, let's find the average speed of the three trial runs. The speeds are 36 mph, 34 mph, and 38 mph. The average speed is given by the sum of the speeds divided by the number of trials:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{36 + 34 + 38}{3}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the sum of the speeds:\n\n\\[\n36 + 34 + 38 = 108\n\\]\n\nNow, divide the sum by the number of trials (which is 3):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{108}{3} = 36 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much faster Timmy has to go than his average speed to make it up the ramp. The required speed is 40 mph, and the average speed is 36 mph. The difference between the required speed and the average speed is:\n\n\\[\n40 - 36 = 4 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Timmy has to go \\(\\boxed{4}\\) mph faster than his average speed to make it up the ramp.",

The average speed is calculated by adding these speeds together and then dividing by the number of trials.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{36 + 34 + 38}{3}\n\\]\n\nAdding the speeds together:\n\n\\[\n36 + 34 + 38 = 108\n\\]\n\nNow, divide the total by the number of trials, which is 3:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{108}{3} = 36 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much faster Timmy needs to go than his average speed to make it up the ramp. The required speed is 40 mph, and the average speed is 36 mph. The difference between these two speeds is:\n\n\\[\n40 - 36 = 4 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Timmy has to go \\boxed{4} mph faster than his average speed to make it up the ramp.",
