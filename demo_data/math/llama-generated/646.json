Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Weekly Shirt Usage\n\n1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**\n   - Kendra wears one shirt each day.\n   - Total shirts for weekdays: \\( 5 \\text{ shirts} \\)\n   - Three days a week, she changes into a different shirt for an after-school club.\n   - Total shirts for after-school clubs: \\( 3 \\text{ shirts} \\)\n   - Total shirts for weekdays and after-school clubs: \\( 5 + 3 = 8 \\text{ shirts} \\)\n\n2. **Saturday:**\n   - Kendra wears one shirt all day.\n   - Total shirts for Saturday: \\( 1 \\text{ shirt} \\)\n\n3. **Sunday:**\n   - Kendra wears one shirt to church and a different shirt for the rest of the day.\n   - Total shirts for Sunday: \\( 2 \\text{ shirts} \\)\n\n### Total Weekly Shirt Usage\n\\[\n8 \\text{ shirts (weekdays and after-school clubs)} + 1 \\text{ shirt (Saturday)} + 2 \\text{ shirts (Sunday)} = 11 \\text{ shirts per week}\n\\]\n\n### Two-Week Shirt Usage\n\\[\n11 \\text{ shirts per week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 22 \\text{ shirts}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Kendra needs \\(\\boxed{22}\\) shirts to be able to only do laundry once every two weeks.",
        "To determine how many shirts Kendra needs, we first calculate the total number of shirts she wears in one week. Then, we multiply that by 2 to find out how many shirts she wears in two weeks.\n\n**Weekday Calculation:**\n- Kendra wears one shirt each weekday (Monday to Friday), which is 5 shirts.\n- Three days a week, she changes into a different shirt for an after-school club, which is 3 shirts.\n- Therefore, the total number of shirts she wears on weekdays is \\(5 + 3 = 8\\).\n\n**Saturday Calculation:**\n- Kendra wears one shirt all day on Saturday, which is 1 shirt.\n\n**Sunday Calculation:**\n- Kendra wears a different shirt to church than she does for the rest of the day on Sunday. This means she wears 1 shirt to church and 1 shirt for the rest of the day, which is a total of 2 shirts.\n\n**Total ShirtsPer Week Calculation:**\n- Adding up all the shirts she wears in one week, we get \\(8\\) (weekdays) + \\(1\\) (Saturday) + \\(2\\) (Sunday) = \\(11\\).\n\n**Total Shirts Per Two Weeks Calculation:**\n- Since Kendra wants to do laundry once every two weeks, we multiply the total number of shirts she wears in one week by 2. This gives us \\(11 \\times 2 = 22\\).\n\nTherefore, Kendra needs \\(\\boxed{22}\\) shirts to be able to only do laundry once every two weeks.",
        "To determine how many shirts Kendra needs, we will calculate the total number of shirts she wears in one week and then double that number for two weeks.\n\nFirst, let's break down her shirt usage for each day of the week:\n\n- **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**\n  - She wears one shirt to school each day: \\(5 \\text{ shirts}\\).\n  - She changes into a different shirt for an after-school club each day: \\(3 \\text{ shirts}\\).\n  - Total shirts for weekdays: \\(5 + 3 = 8 \\text{ shirts}\\).\n\n- **Saturday:**\n  - She wears one shirt all day: \\(1 \\text{ shirt}\\).\n\n- **Sunday:**\n  - She wears one shirt to church and a different shirt for the rest of the day: \\(2 \\text{ shirts}\\).\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of shirts she wears in one week:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ (weekdays)} + 1 \\text{ (Saturday)} + 2 \\text{ (Sunday)} = 11 \\text{ shirts}\n\\]\n\nSince Kendra wants to do laundry once every two weeks, we need to double the total number of shirts for one week:\n\\[\n11 \\text{ shirts/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 22 \\text{ shirts}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Kendra needs \\boxed{22} shirts to be able to only do laundry once every two weeks.",
