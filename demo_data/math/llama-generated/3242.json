They light enough fireworks to show the full year then light enough fireworks to write “HAPPY NEW YEAR” in the sky. They then light another 50 boxes of fireworks as part of the display. Each box of fireworks contains 8 fireworks. If it takes 6 fireworks to display a number and 5 fireworks to display a letter, how many fireworks are lit during the display?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
