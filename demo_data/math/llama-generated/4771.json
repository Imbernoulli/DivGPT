After 20 days, the seedlings were ready to be transferred. On the first day, he planted 200 seedlings on the farm. On the second day, while working alongside his father, he planted twice the number of seedlings he planted on the first day.

Therefore, the number of seedlings Remi planted on the second day is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 200 = 400\n   \\]\n3. The total number of seedlings transferred to the farm over the two days is 1200. Let's denote the number of seedlings Remi's father planted on the second day as \\( x \\). The total number of seedlings planted over the two days can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   200 + 400 + x = 1200\n   \\]\n4. Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   600 + x = 1200\n   \\]\n5. Solve for \\( x \\) by subtracting 600 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   x = 1200 - 600 = 600\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of seedlings Remi's father planted is \\(\\boxed{600}\\).",
