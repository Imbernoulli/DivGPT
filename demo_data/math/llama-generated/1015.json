Thomas and his 4 friends take 1/4 of the bars and decide to divide them equally between them. One of Thomas's friends doesn't like chocolate bars very much and returns 5 of his bars to the box. Later, his sister Piper comes home and takes 5 fewer bars than those taken in total by Thomas and his friends so she can also share with her friends. What's the total number of bars left in the box?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total number of chocolate bars left in the box, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of bars taken by Thomas and his friends:**\n   - The chocolate box initially contains 200 bars.\n   - Thomas and his 4 friends take \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the bars.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bars taken by Thomas and friends} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 200 = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many bars each friend gets:**\n   - Thomas and his 4 friends divide the 50 bars equally.\n   \\[\n   \\text{ compuls per friend} = \\frac{50}{5} = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of bars returned by one friend:**\n   - One friend returns 5 bars to the box.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Êùµ returned} = 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of bars taken by Piper:**\n   - Piper takes 5 fewer bars than those taken in total by Thomas and his friends.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bars taken by Piper} = 50 - 5 = 45\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of bars taken by Thomas, his friends, and Piper:**\n   - Total bars taken = Bars taken by Thomas and friends + Bars taken by Piper\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total bars taken} = 50 + 45 = 95\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total number of bars returned to the box:**\n   - Total bars returned = Bars returned by one friend\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total bars returned} = 5\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the net number of bars removed from the box:**\n   - Net bars removed = Total bars taken - Total bars returned\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net bars removed} = 95 - 5 = 90\n   \\]\n\n8. **Determine the total number of bars left in the box:**\n   - Initial number of bars = 200\n   - Net bars removed = 90\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bars left} = 200 - 90 = 110\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of bars left in the box is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",
