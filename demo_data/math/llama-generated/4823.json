        "To determine how much money Prince spent on buying the CDs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of CDs that cost $10 each.\n2. Calculate the number of CDs that cost $5 each.\n3. Determine how many CDs Prince bought at each price.\n4. Calculate the total amount of money Prince spent.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of CDs that cost $10 each.**\n\nThe store sold a total of 200 CDs. According to the problem, 40% of the CDs cost $10 each.\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 200 = 80\n\\]\nSo, there are 80 CDs that cost $10 each.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of CDs that cost $5 each.**\n\nSince the rest of the CDs cost $5 each, we subtract the number of $10 CDs from the total number of CDs.\n\\[\n200 - 80 = 120\n\\]\nSo, there are 120 CDs that cost $5 each.\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many CDs Prince bought at each price.**\n\n Prince bought half of the CDs sold at $10 each and all of the CDs sold at $5 each.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of $10 CDs Prince bought} = \\frac{80}{2} = 40\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Number of $5 CDs Prince bought} = 120\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Prince spent.**\n\n Prince spent money on both types of CDs. We calculate the cost for each type and then add the two amounts together.\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of $10 CDs} = 40 \\times 10 = 400\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of $5 CDs} = 120 \\times 5 = 600\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount spent} = 400 + 600 = 1000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Prince spent on buying the CDs is \\(\\boxed{1000}\\).",
        "To determine how much money Prince spent on buying the CDs, we start by calculating the number of CDs that cost $10 each and the number of CDs that cost $5 each. Given that 40% of the CDs cost $10 each, we can find the number of $10 CDs as follows:\n\n\\[\n0.4 \\times 200 = 80\n\\]\n\nThis means there are 80 CDs that cost $10 each. Since the total number of CDs is 200, the number of CDs that cost $5 each is:\n\n\\[\n200 - 80 = 120\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many CDs Prince bought. Prince bought half of the CDs that cost $10 each and all of the CDs that cost $5 each. Therefore, the number of $10 CDs Prince bought is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{80}{2} = 40\n\\]\n\nAnd the number of $5 CDs Prince bought is:\n\n\\[\n120\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total amount of money Prince spent. The cost of the $10 CDs is:\n\n\\[\n40 \\times 10 = 400\n\\]\n\nThe cost of the $5 CDs is:\n\n\\[\n120 \\times 5 = 600\n\\]\n\nAdding these two amounts together gives us the total amount of money Prince spent:\n\n\\[\n400 + 600 = 1000\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Prince spent on buying the CDs is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1000}\n\\]",

Since the total number of CDs is 200, we can find the number of $10 CDs by multiplying 200 by 40% (or 0.40):\n\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 200 = 80\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 80 CDs that cost $10 each.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of CDs that cost $5 each.**\n\nSince the rest of the CDs cost $5 each, we subtract the number of $10 CDs from the total number of CDs:\n\n\\[\n200 - 80 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 120 CDs that cost $5 each.\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many CDs Prince bought at $10 each.**\n\n Prince bought half the CDs sold at $10 each. Since there are 80 CDs that cost $10 each, we can find the number of $10 CDs Prince bought by dividing 80 by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{80}{2} = 40\n\\]\n\nSo, Prince bought 40 CDs at $10 each.\n\n**Step 4: Determine how many CDs Prince bought at $5 each.**\n\n Prince bought all of the CDs sold at $5 each. Since there are 120 CDs that cost $5 each, Prince bought 120 CDs at $5 each.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money Prince spent.**\n\nTo find the total amount of money Prince spent, we multiply the number of $10 CDs he bought by $10 and the number of $5 CDs he bought by $5, and then add the two amounts together:\n\n\\[\n40 \\times 10 + 120 \\times 5 = 400 + 600 = 1000\n\\]\n\nSo, the total amount of money Prince spent on buying the CDs is \\(\\boxed{1000}\\).",

Since there are 200 CDs in total and 80 of them cost $10 each, the number of $5 CDs is:\n\\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \\]\nSo, there are 120 CDs that cost $5 each.\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many CDs Prince bought at each price.**\n\n Prince bought half the CDs sold at $10 each, and all of the CDs sold at $5 each. Therefore, the number of $10 CDs Prince bought is:\n\\[ \\frac{80}{2} = 40 \\]\nAnd the number of $5 CDs Prince bought is:\n\\[ 120 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the CDs Prince bought.**\n\nThe total cost of the $10 CDs Prince bought is:\n\\[ 40 \\times 10 = 400 \\]\nThe total cost of the $5 CDs Prince bought is:\n\\[ 120 \\times 5 = 600 \\]\nAdding these two amounts together gives the total amount of money Prince spent:\n\\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Prince spent on buying the CDs is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]",
