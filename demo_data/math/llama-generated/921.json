At lunchtime, Elsa gave her best friend Susie 5 marbles:\n   \\[\n   37 - 5 = 32\n   \\]\n   So, after lunch, Elsa has 32 marbles.\n\n3. In the afternoon, Elsa's mom bought her a new bag with 12 marbles:\n   \\[\n   32 + 12 = 44\n   \\]\n   So, after receiving the new bag, Elsa has 44 marbles.\n\n4. Susie came back and gave Elsa twice as many marbles as she received at lunch. Since Susie received 5 marbles at lunch, she gave Elsa:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 5 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, after Susie gave Elsa 10 marbles, Elsa has:\n   \\[\n   44 + 10 = 54\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles Elsa ended the day with is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
