        "To determine how many jelly beans remained in the container, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans taken by all 10 people and then subtract that from the initial number of jelly beans.\n\nFirst, we find out how many jelly beans each of the last four people took. According to the problem, each of the last four people took 400 jelly beans. Therefore, the total number of jelly beans taken by the last four people is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 400 = 1600\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many jelly beans each of the first six people took. The problem states that each of the first six people took twice as many jelly beans as each of the last four people. Since each of the last four people took 400 jelly beans, each of the first six people took:\n\\[\n2 \\times 400 = 800\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of jelly beans taken by the first six people is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 800 = 4800\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the total number of jelly beans taken by the first six people and the last four people to find the total number of jelly beans taken by all 10 people:\n\\[\n4800 + 1600 = 6400\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of jelly beans taken by all 10 people from the initial number of jelly beans to find out how many jelly beans remained in the container:\n\\[\n8000 - 6400 = 1600\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of jelly beans that remained in the container is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1600}\n\\]",
