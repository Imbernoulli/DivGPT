        "To determine how many cans of stew are needed to feed 30% fewer people, we start by calculating how many people that is. If Paddy'sotr has 40 people, then 30% fewer people is:\n\n\\[ 40 - (0.30 \\times 40) = 40 - 12 = 28 \\]\n\nSo, we need to find out how many cans are required to feed 28 people. Since 600 cans are required to feed 40 people, we can set up a proportion to find out how many cans are needed for 28 people. Let \\( x \\) be the number of cans needed for 28 people. The proportion is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{600}{40} = \\frac{x}{28} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{600 \\times 28}{40} = \\frac{16800}{40} = 420 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cans needed to feed 30% fewer people is \\(\\boxed{420}\\).",
