Find the difference in revenue between the high season and the low season.\n\nLet's start with the high season calculations:\n\n1. **Total number of tuna packs sold in a day during the high season:**\n   - Packs sold per hour: 6\n   - Hours of operation: 15\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ packs/hour} \\times 15 \\text{ hours} = 90 \\text{ packs}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Revenue generated from tuna packs sold in the high season:**\n   - Price per pack: $60\n   \\[\n   90 \\text{ packs} \\times 60 \\text{ dollars/pack} = 5400 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNext, let's perform the calculations for the low season:\n\n1. **Total number of tuna packs sold in a day during the low season:**\n   - Packs sold per hour: 4\n   - Hours of operation: 15\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ packs/hour} \\times 15 \\text{ hours} = 60 \\text{ packs}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Revenue generated from tuna packs sold in the low season:**\n   - Price per pack: $60\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ packs} \\times 60 \\text{ dollars/pack} = 3600 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference in revenue between the high season and the low season:\n\n\\[\n5400 \\text{ dollars} - 3600 \\text{ dollars} = 1800 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus,
