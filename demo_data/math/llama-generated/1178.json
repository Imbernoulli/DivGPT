        "To determine the total number of legs of furniture Kenzo has remaining in his company, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of legs for the office chairs before any are disposed of.\n2. Determine how many office chairs are disposed of after a month.\n3. Calculate the number of legs for the remaining office chairs.\n4. Calculate the total number of legs for the round tables.\n5. Add the number of legs from the remaining office chairs and the round tables.\n\nLet's start with the office chairs:\n- Kenzo has 80 office chairs.\n- Each office chair has 5 legs.\n- Therefore, the total number of legs for the office chairs is \\(80 \\times 5 = 400\\).\n\nNext, we need to determine how many office chairs are disposed of after a month:\n- 40% of the office chairs are damaged and have to be disposed of.\n- So, the number of office chairs disposed of is \\(80 \\times 0.40 = 32\\).\n- The number of office chairs remaining is \\(80 - 32 = 48\\).\n\nNow, we calculate the number of legs for the remaining office chairs:\n- Each remaining office chair has 5 legs.\n- Therefore, the total number of legs for the remaining office chairs is \\(48 \\times 5 = 240\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of legs for the round tables:\n- Kenzo has 20 round tables.\n- Each round table has 3 legs.\n- Therefore, the total number of legs for the round tables is \\(20 \\times 3 = 60\\).\n\nFinally, we add the number of legs from the remaining office chairs and the round tables:\n- The total number of legs remaining is \\(240 + 60 = 300\\).\n\nThus, the total number of legs of furniture Kenzo has remaining in his company is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
