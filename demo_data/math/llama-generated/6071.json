        "To determine the total number of fish James has, we start by identifying the number of fish in each tank. We know that one tank has 20 fish. The other two tanks each have twice as many fish as the first tank. Therefore, each of the other two tanks has:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ fish} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of fish by adding the number of fish in all three tanks together:\n\n\\[ 20 + 40 + 40 = 100 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of fish James has is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]",
