        "To determine how many cents can be saved on each apple by buying $4 for 10 apples instead of $3 for 6 apples, we need to calculate the cost per apple for each store and then find the difference between these two costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost per apple at the first store:\n- The first store charges $3 for 6 apples.\n- To find the cost per apple, we divide the total cost by the number of apples:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cost per apple at the first store} = \\frac{3 \\text{ dollars}}{6 \\text{ apples}} = 0.50 \\text{ dollars per apple}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost per apple at the second store:\n- The second store charges $4 for 10 apples.\n- To find the cost per apple, we divide the total cost by the number of apples:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cost per apple at the second store} = \\frac{4 \\text{ dollars}}{10 \\text{ apples}} = 0.40 \\text{ dollars per apple}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the difference in cost per apple between the two stores:\n- Subtract the cost per apple at the second store from the cost per apple at the first store:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Difference in cost per apple} = 0.50 \\text{ dollars per apple} - 0.40 \\text{ dollars per apple} = 0.10 \\text{ dollars per apple}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the difference from dollars to cents:\n- Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the difference by 100:\n  \\[\n  0.10 \\text{ dollars per apple} \\times 100 = 10 \\text{ cents per apple}\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, you can save \\(\\boxed{10}\\) cents on each apple by buying $4 for 10 apples instead of $3 for 6 apples.",
