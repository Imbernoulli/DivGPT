Determine the new delivery quantity after doubling the original amount.\n3. Calculate the cost of the new delivery using the cost per bale of the better quality hay.\n4. Find the difference between the cost of the new delivery and the cost of the original delivery.\n\nLet's start with the original delivery:\n- Chester original delivered 10 bales of hay.\n- The cost per bale of the original hay was $15.\n\nThe total cost of the original delivery is:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ bales} \\times \\$15 \\text{ per bale} = \\$150\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the new delivery quantity:\n- Farmer Brown wants Chester to double the delivery.\n- Therefore, the new delivery quantity is:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ bales} \\times 2 = 20 \\text{ bales}\n\\]\n\nThe cost per bale of the better quality hay is $18.\n\nThe total cost of the new delivery is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ bales} \\times \\$18 \\text{ per bale} = \\$360\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the cost of the new delivery and the cost of the original delivery:\n\\[\n\\$360 - \\$150 = \\$210\n\\]\n\nThus, Farmer Brown will need \\(\\boxed{210}\\) more dollars to meet his new requirements.",
        "To determine how much more money Farmer Brown will need to meet his new requirements, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial cost of the hay:**\n   - Chester was initially delivering 10 bales of hay.\n   - The cost per bale of the previous hay was $15.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial cost} = 10 \\text{ bales} \\times \\$15 \\text{ per bale} = \\$150\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the new number of bales required:**\n   - Farmer Brown wants Chester to double the delivery of bales.\n   \\[\n   \\text{New number of bales} = 2 \\times 10 \\text{ bales} = 20 \\text{ bales}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the better quality hay:**\n   - The better quality hay costs $18 per bale.\n   \\[\n   \\text{New cost} = 20 \\text{ bales} \\times \\$18 \\text{ per bale} = \\$360\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the additional cost:**\n   - The additional cost is the difference between the new cost and the initial cost.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional cost} = \\$360 - \\$150 = \\$210\n   \\]\n\nThus, Farmer Brown will need \\(\\boxed{210}\\) more dollars to meet his new requirements.",
