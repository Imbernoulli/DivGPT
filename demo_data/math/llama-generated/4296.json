        "To determine how many more limbs five aliens have than five Martians, we need to calculate the total number of limbs for each type of creature and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of limbs for one alien:\n- Aliens have 3 arms and 8 legs.\n- Therefore, the total number of limbs for one alien is \\(3 + 8 = 11\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of limbs for five aliens:\n- Since each alien has 11 limbs, the total number of limbs for five aliens is \\(5 \\times 11 = 55\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of limbs for one Martian:\n- Martians have half as many legs as aliens, so they have \\(8 \\div 2 = 4\\) legs.\n- Martians have twice as many arms as aliens, so they have \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) arms.\n- Therefore, the total number of limbs for one Martian is \\(6 + 4 = 10\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of limbs for five Martians:\n- Since each Martian has 10 limbs, the total number of limbs for five Martians is \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\nFinally, we find the difference in the total number of limbs between five aliens and five Martians:\n- The difference is \\(55 - 50 = 5\\).\n\nThus, five aliens have \\(\\boxed{5}\\) more limbs than five Martians.",
