        "To determine how many more batches of cookies Gigi can make in the future with the remaining amount of flour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

Determine how many more batches of cookies Gigi can make with the remaining flour.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of flour Gigi uses to bake 3 batches of cookies.
