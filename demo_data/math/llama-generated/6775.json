        "To determine how many gallons of gas Felicity used, we start by defining variables for the amounts of gas each girl used. Let \\( A \\) represent the number of gallons Adhira used.

Therefore, we can express the amount of gas Felicity used as \\( 4A - 5 \\).\n\nWe are also given that together the girls used 30 gallons of gas. This can be written as the equation:\n\\[\nA + (4A - 5) = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[\nA + 4A - 5 = 30\n\\]\n\\[\n5A - 5 = 30\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( A \\), we add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n5A - 5 + 5 = 30 + 5\n\\]\n\\[\n5A = 35\n\\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( A \\) by dividing both sides by 5:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{35}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nA = 7\n\\]\n\nSo, Adhira used 7 gallons of gas. To find out how many gallons Felicity used, we substitute \\( A = 7 \\) back into the expression for Felicity's gas usage:\n\\[\n4A - 5 = 4(7) - 5\n\\]\n\\[\n4A - 5 = 28 - 5\n\\]\n\\[\n4A - 5 = 23\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Felicity used \\(\\boxed{23}\\) gallons of gas.",

According to the problem, Felicity used 5 less gallons than four times the number of gallons Adhira used. Therefore, we can express the amount of gas Felicity used as \\( 4A - 5 \\).\n\nThe total amount of gas used by both Felicity and Adhira is given as 30 gallons. We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship:\n\n\\[\nA + (4A - 5) = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[\nA + 4A - 5 = 30\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5A - 5 = 30\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( 5A \\), we add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n5A = 35\n\\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( A \\) by dividing both sides by 5:\n\n\\[\nA = 7\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Adhira used 7 gallons of gas, we can find out how many gallons Felicity used by substituting \\( A = 7 \\) back into the expression \\( 4A - 5 \\):\n\n\\[\n4(7) - 5 = 28 - 5 = 23\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Felicity used \\(\\boxed{23}\\) gallons of gas."
