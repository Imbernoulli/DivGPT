        "To determine the cost of each bag of chips, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the chocolate bars.\n2. Determine the total amount spent on both the chocolate bars and the bags of chips.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the chocolate bars from the total amount spent to find the total cost of the bags of chips.\n4. Divide the total cost of the bags of chips by the number of bags to find the cost per bag.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of each chocolate bar is $2, and Frank buys 5 chocolate bars.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of chocolate bars} = 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. Frank hands the cashier $20 and gets $4 back as change. Therefore, the total amount spent is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount spent} = 20 - 4 = 16 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract the total cost of the chocolate bars from the total amount spent to find the total cost of the bags of chips:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of bags of chips} = 16 - 10 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. Frank buys 2 bags of chips, so the cost per bag is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per bag of chips} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the cost of each bag of chips is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

This means the total amount spent is:\n\\[\n20 - 4 = 16\n\\]\nSo, the total amount spent on both the chocolate bars and the bags of chips is $16.\n\nSince we already know the total cost of the chocolate bars is $10, the total cost of the bags of chips is:\n\\[\n16 - 10 = 6\n\\]\nFrank buys 2 bags of chips, so the cost of each bag of chips is:\n\\[\n6 \\div 2 = 3\n\\]\nTherefore, the cost of each bag of chips is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
