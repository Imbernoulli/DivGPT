        "To determine how long Janet has to wait for her sister to catch up, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to cross the lake and then find the difference between these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Janet to cross the lake.

The time \\( t_J \\) it takes for Janet to cross the lake is given by the formula:\n\\[\nt_J = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{30 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Janet's sister to cross the lake. Her sister's speed is 12 miles per hour, and the lake is 60 miles wide. The time \\( t_S \\) it takes for Janet's sister to cross the lake is given by the formula:\n\\[\nt_S = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{12 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThe difference in time between when Janet arrives and when her sister arrives is:\n\\[\nt_S - t_J = 5 \\text{ hours} - 2 \\text{ hours} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Janet has to wait \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours for her sister to catch up.",

        "To determine how long Janet has to wait for her sister to catch up, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to cross the lake and then find the difference between these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Janet to cross the lake. Janet is driving in a speedboat with a speed of 30 miles per hour. The lake is 60 miles wide. The time \\( t_J \\) it takes for Janet to cross the lake is given by the formula:\n\\[\nt_J = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{30 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Janet's sister to cross the lake. Her sister is driving in a sailboat with a speed of 12 miles per hour. The lake is also 60 miles wide. The time \\( t_S \\) it takes for her sister to cross the lake is given by the formula:\n\\[\nt_S = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{12 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the difference in time between when Janet arrives and when her sister arrives. This difference \\( \\Delta t \\) is:\n\\[\n\\Delta t = t_S - t_J = 5 \\text{ hours} - 2 \\text{ hours} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Janet has to wait on the other side for her sister to catch up for \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours.",
