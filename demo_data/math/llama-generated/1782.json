        "To determine the total number of tables the carpenter made over the two months, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of tables made this month. According to the problem, the carpenter made 10 tables this month.\n2. Determine the number of tables made last month. The problem states that last month the carpenter made three fewer tables than this month. Therefore, we subtract 3 from the number of tables made this month:\n   \\[\n   10 - 3 = 7\n   \\]\n   So, the carpenter made 7 tables last month.\n3. Calculate the total number of tables made over the two months by adding the number of tables made this month to the number of tables made last month:\n   \\[\n   10 + 7 = 17\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of tables the carpenter made is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",
