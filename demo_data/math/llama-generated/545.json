        "To determine how much John pays per year to cut his grass, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the growth rate per year:**\n   - The grass grows at a rate of 0.5 inches per month.\n   - There are 12 months in a year.\n   \\[\n   0.5 \\text{ inches/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 6 \\text{ inches/year}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how often John cuts his grass:**\n   - John cuts his grass when it reaches 4 inches.\n   - The grass starts at 2 inches and grows to 4 inches.\n   - The growth needed is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ inches} - 2 \\text{ inches} = 2 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n   - Since the grass grows 6 inches per year, the time it takes to grow 2 inches is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2 \\text{ inches}}{6 \\text{ inches/year}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ year}\n   \\]\n   - Therefore, John cuts his grass every \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of a year.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of cuts per year:**\n   - Since John cuts his grass every \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of a year, the number of cuts per year is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1 \\text{ year}}{\\frac{1}{3} \\text{ year/cut}} = 3 \\text{ cuts/year}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the total cost per year:**\n   - Each cut costs $100.\n   - The total cost per year is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ cuts/year} \\times 100 \\text{ dollars/cut} = 300 \\text{ dollars/year}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the amount John pays per year is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
        "To determine how much John pays per year to cut his grass, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the growth period**: The grass grows from 2 inches to 4 inches, which is an increase of:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ inches} - 2 \\text{ inches} = 2 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n   Since the grass grows at a rate of 0.5 inches per month, the time it takes to grow 2 inches is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2 \\text{ inches}}{0.5 \\text{ inches/month}} = 4 \\text{ months}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of cuts per year**: Since it takes 4 months for the grass to grow from 2 inches to 4 inches, John will cut his grass every 4 months.
