        "To determine how many pairs of shoes the cobbler can mend in a week, we need to calculate the number of hours he works each day and then sum up the total hours for the week. Finally, we will multiply the total hours by the rate at which he mends shoes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of hours the cobbler works each day from Monday to Thursday:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 32 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of hours the cobbler works on Friday:\n\\[\n11 \\text{ am} - 8 \\text{ am} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the hours worked from Monday to Thursday and the hours worked on Friday to find the total hours worked in the week:\n\\[\n32 \\text{ hours} + 3 \\text{ hours} = 35 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThe cobbler mends 3 pairs of shoes per hour. Therefore, we multiply the total hours by the rate to find the total number of pairs of shoes mended in the week:\n\\[\n35 \\text{ hours} \\times 3 \\text{ pairs/hour} = 105 \\text{ pairs}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of pairs of shoes the cobbler can mend in a week is \\boxed{105}.",
