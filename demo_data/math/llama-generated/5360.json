        "To determine the weight of each of Trace's shopping bags, we start by calculating the total weight of Gordon's two shopping bags. Gordon has one bag that weighs 3 pounds and another that weighs 7 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of Gordon's shopping bags is:\n\n\\[3 + 7 = 10 \\text{ pounds}\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the total weight of Trace's five shopping bags is the same as the total weight of Gordon's two shopping bags. So, the total weight of Trace's shopping bags is also 10 pounds. Since Trace has five shopping bags and they all weigh the same amount, we can find the weight of each of Trace's shopping bags by dividing the total weight by the number of bags:\n\n\\[10 \\div 5 = 2 \\text{ pounds}\\]\n\nThus, the weight of each of Trace's shopping bags is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) pounds.",
