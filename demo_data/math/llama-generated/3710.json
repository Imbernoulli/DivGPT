Since there are 128 ounces in a gallon (because \\(16 \\times 8 = 128\\)), Jim would need to buy 8 bottles of 16-ounce mayo to get a gallon. The cost of one 16-ounce bottle is $3, so the cost of 8 bottles is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 3 = 24 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we compare this cost to the cost of the gallon container at Costco, which is $8.
