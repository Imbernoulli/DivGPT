        "To determine how many liters are left in the barrel after it lost 10% of its contents, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of liquid lost due to the leak.\n2. Subtract the lost amount from the original amount of liquid in the barrel.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of liquid lost. The barrel originally contains 220 liters, and it lost 10% of its contents. To find 10% of 220 liters, we multiply 220 by 0.10:\n\n\\[ 220 \\times 0.10 = 22 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nSo, 22 liters of liquid were lost. Next, we subtract the lost amount from the original amount to find out how many liters are left in the barrel:\n\n\\[ 220 - 22 = 198 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of liters left in the barrel is \\(\\boxed{198}\\).",
