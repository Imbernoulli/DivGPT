        "To determine the total shipping cost for Lizzy's fish, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of crates needed.\n2. Determine the total shipping cost based on the number of crates.\n\nFirst, we find out how many crates are needed to pack 540 pounds of fish, given that each crate holds 30 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight of the fish by the weight each crate can hold:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of crates} = \\frac{540 \\text{ pounds}}{30 \\text{ pounds per crate}} = 18 \\text{ crates}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total shipping cost. Since each crate costs $1.5 to ship, we multiply the number of crates by the cost per crate:\n\\[\n\\text{Total shipping cost} = 18 \\text{ crates} \\times 1.5 \\text{ dollars per crate} = 27 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Lizzy will pay \\(\\boxed{27}\\) dollars for the shipment.",

Therefore, the total shipping cost is:\n\\[\n18 \\text{ crates} \\times 1.5 \\text{ dollars per crate} = 27 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount Lizzy will pay for the shipment is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{27}\n\\]",
