        "To determine the final price an officer who has served at least three years has to pay for duty shoes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the price after the initial 20% discount.\n2. Calculate the price after the additional 25% discount on the already discounted price.\n\nLet's start with the original price of the shoes, which is $85.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the price after the initial 20% discount.**\n\nA 20% discount means the officer pays 80% of the original price. We can calculate this as follows:\n\\[\n85 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 85 \\times 0.80 = 68\n\\]\nSo, after the initial 20% discount, the price is $68.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the price after the additional 25% discount.**\n\nA 25% discount on the already discounted price means the officer pays 75% of $68. We can calculate this as follows:\n\\[\n68 \\times (1 - 0.25) = 68 \\times 0.75 = 51\n\\]\nSo, after the additional 25% discount, the price is $51.\n\nTherefore, the final price an officer who has served at least three years has to pay for shoes is \\(\\boxed{51}\\).",
