Since each ticket costs $90, we multiply the number of tickets by the cost per ticket:\n\\[ 4 \\times 90 = 360 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the tickets is $360.\n\nNext, we subtract the amount of money Daria currently has from the total cost of the tickets to find out how much more she needs to earn:\n\\[ 360 - 189 = 171 \\]\nSo, Daria needs to earn \\(\\boxed{171}\\) dollars.",
