        "To determine how many dishes Sandrine washed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of pears Charles picked.\n2. Use the given relationship to find the number of bananas Charles cooked.\n3. Use the given relationship to find the number of dishes Sandrine washed.\n\nLet's start with the number of pears Charles picked. According to the problem, Charles picked 50 pears.\n\nNext, we know that the number of bananas Charles cooked is 3 times the number of pears he picked. Therefore, we calculate the number of bananas Charles cooked as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of bananas Charles cooked} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of pears Charles picked} = 3 \\times 50 = 150\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that the number of dishes Sandrine washed is 10 more than the number of bananas Charles cooked. Therefore, we calculate the number of dishes Sandrine washed as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of dishes Sandrine washed} = \\text{Number of bananas Charles cooked} + 10 = 150 + 10 = 160\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of dishes Sandrine washed is \\boxed{160}.",

Therefore, we calculate the number of dishes Sandrine washed as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of dishes Sandrine washed} = 150 + 10 = 160\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of dishes Sandrine washed is \\boxed{160}.",
