To find out how many bags Mark needs, we divide the total amount of food by the amount each bag contains:\n\\[ \\frac{7 \\text{ cups}}{3.5 \\text{ cups/bag}} = 2 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nThe cost for 2 bags of food is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ bags} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/bag} = 4 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the cost of the puppy to the cost of the food.**\n\nThe cost of the puppy is $10, and the cost of the food is $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ dollars} + 4 \\text{ dollars} = 14 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total cost Mark paid is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]",
