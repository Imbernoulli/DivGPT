Determine how many white cookies are left after eating.\n6. Add the remaining black cookies and white cookies to find the total number of cookies left.\n\nLet's start with the initial number of black cookies. Since Cristian has 50 more black cookies than white cookies, and he initially had 80 white cookies, we can calculate the number of black cookies as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of black cookies} = 80 + 50 = 130 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many black cookies Cristian eats. He eats half of the black cookies:\n\\[ \\text{Black cookies eaten} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 130 = 65 \\]\nSo, the number of black cookies left is:\n\\[ \\text{Black cookies remaining} = 130 - 65 = 65 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate how many white cookies Cristian eats. He eats \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the white cookies:\n\\[ \\text{White cookies eaten} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 80 = 60 \\]\nSo, the number of white cookies left is:\n\\[ \\text{White cookies remaining} = 80 - 60 = 20 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the remaining black cookies and white cookies to find the total number of cookies left:\n\\[ \\text{Total cookies remaining} = 65 + 20 = 85 \\]\n\nThus, the number of cookies remaining within the cookie jar is:\n\\[ \\boxed{85} \\]",

Add the remaining black cookies and white cookies together.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial number of black cookies. Since Cristian has 50 more black cookies than white cookies and he initially had 80 white cookies, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Initial number of black cookies} = 80 + 50 = 130 \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many black cookies Cristian eats. He eats half of the black cookies:\n\\[ \\text{Black cookies eaten} = \\frac{130}{2} = 65 \\]\nSo, the number of black cookies left is:\n\\[ \\text{Black cookies remaining} = 130 - 65 = 65 \\]\n\nThen, we determine how many white cookies Cristian eats. He eats \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the white cookies:\n\\[ \\text{White cookies eaten} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 80 = 60 \\]\nSo, the number of white cookies left is:\n\\[ \\text{White cookies remaining} = 80 - 60 = 20 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the remaining black cookies and white cookies together to find the total number of cookies left in the cookie jar:\n\\[ \\text{Total cookies remaining} = 65 + 20 = 85 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cookies remaining in the cookie jar is:\n\\[ \\boxed{85} \\]",
