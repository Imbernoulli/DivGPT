        "To determine how many books McGregor and Floyd still have to read, we start by finding out how many books they have already completed together. McGregor finished 34 books, and Floyd finished 32 books. So, we add these two amounts together:\n\n\\[ 34 + 32 = 66 \\]\n\nThis means that McGregor and Floyd have finished a total of 66 books. Since they were assigned 89 books to read, we subtract the number of books they have already finished from the total number of books assigned:\n\n\\[ 89 - 66 = 23 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of books they still have to read is \\(\\boxed{23}\\).",
