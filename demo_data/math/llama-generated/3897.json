        "To determine the total grams of protein Arnold will consume, we need to calculate the protein content from each item separately and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **Collagen Powder**: Arnold's collagen powder has 18 grams of protein for every 2 scoops. Therefore, for 1 scoop, the protein content is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{18 \\text{ grams}}{2 \\text{ scoops}} = 9 \\text{ grams per scoop}\n   \\]\n   So, 1 scoop of collagen powder provides 9 grams of protein.\n\n2. **Protein Powder**: Arnold's protein powder has 21 grams of protein per scoop. Therefore, 1 scoop of protein powder provides 21 grams of protein.\n\n3. **Steak**: Arnold's steak has 56 grams of protein.
