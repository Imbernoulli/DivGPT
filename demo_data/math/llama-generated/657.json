        "To determine the total time it took the four athletes to finish the relay race, we need to calculate the running time of each athlete and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's find the running time of each athlete:\n- Athlete 1 ran for 55 seconds.\n- Athlete 2 ran 10 seconds more than Athlete 1. Therefore, Athlete 2's running time is:\n  \\[\n  55 + 10 = 65 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n- Athlete 3 ran 15 seconds less than Athlete 2. Therefore, Athlete 3's running time is:\n  \\[\n  65 - 15 = 50 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n- Athlete 4 ran 25 seconds less than Athlete 1. Therefore, Athlete 4's running time is:\n  \\[\n  55 - 25 = 30 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we sum the running times of all four athletes:\n\\[\n55 + 65 + 50 + 30\n\\]\n\nLet's add these step by step:\n\\[\n55 + 65 = 120\n\\]\n\\[\n120 + 50 = 170\n\\]\n\\[\n170 + 30 = 200\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it took them to finish the relay race is \\boxed{200} seconds.",
