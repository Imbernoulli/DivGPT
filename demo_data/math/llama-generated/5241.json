At the start of May, Celine borrowed three books from the library to read at home for her upcoming examinations. If she returned one book 20 days after borrowing it, and the other two stayed at her house until the end of May, calculate the total amount of money that she paid at the library for lending the three books.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
