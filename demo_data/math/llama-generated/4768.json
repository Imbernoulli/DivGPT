Since there are 8 patients with standard care and it takes 5 minutes to serve each of them, the total serving time for these patients is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 5 = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total serving time for all patients by adding the total serving time for patients with special dietary requirements and the total serving time for patients with standard care:\n\\[\n24 + 40 = 64 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes for Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{64}\n\\]",

Since it takes 5 minutes to serve each standard care patient, the total time for the standard care patients is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 5 = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nFor the patients with special dietary requirements, the serving time is increased by 20%.
