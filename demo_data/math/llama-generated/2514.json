        "Let's start with the initial number of marbles Brianna had, which is 24. She lost 4 marbles through a hole in the bag, so the number of marbles left after losing these 4 marbles is:\n\\[ 24 - 4 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, Brianna gave away twice as many marbles as she had lost through the hole. Since she lost 4 marbles, she gave away:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\nSo, the number of marbles left after giving away 8 marbles is:\n\\[ 20 - 8 = 12 \\]\n\nFinally, her dog ate half as many marbles as Brianna had lost through the hole.
