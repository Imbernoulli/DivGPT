His average speed for this trip is 50 miles per hour. Every two hours of driving, he makes a rest stop for 15 minutes. His car gets 18 miles per gallon of gas, and his gas indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons, at which point he stops to refill, which takes 10 minutes. How long, in minutes, does he take to get to his parents' house, if he starts out with a full tank of gas?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total driving time:**\n   Jeremy's trip is 600 miles, and his average speed is 50 miles per hour. Therefore, the total driving time is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{600 \\text{ miles}}{50 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 12 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of rest stops:**\n   Jeremy makes a rest stop every 2 hours. Since he drives for 12 hours, the number of rest stops is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12 \\text{ hours}}{2 \\text{ hours per rest}} = 6 \\text{ rest stops}\n   \\]\n   However, since he does not make a rest stop at the end of his trip, he actually makes 5 rest stops.\n\n3. **Calculate the total time spent on rest stops:**\n   Each rest stop takes 15 minutes, so the total time spent on rest stops is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ rest stops} \\times 15 \\text{ minutes per rest} = 75 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of gas stops:**\n   Jeremy's car gets 18 miles per gallon, and his gas indicator comes on when he's used 15 gallons. Therefore, he uses 15 gallons for every:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ gallons} \\times 18 \\text{ miles per gallon} = 270 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n   Since he drives 600 miles, the number of gas stops is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{600 \\text{ miles}}{270 \\text{ miles per gas stop}} \\approx 2.22\n   \\]\n   Since he cannot make a fraction of a gas stop, he makes 2 gas stops (he will have just over 130 miles left when he signs off at the second gas stop and will not have enough for a third).\n\n5. **Calculate the total time spent on gas stops:**\n   Each gas stop takes 10 minutes, so the total time spent on gas stops is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ gas stops} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes per gas stop} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total travel time:**\n   The total travel time is the sum of the driving time, the time spent on rest stops, and the time spent on gas stops:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} + 75 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} = 720 \\text{ minutes} + 75 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} = 815 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Jeremy takes to get to his parents' house is \\(\\boxed{815}\\) minutes.",
        "To determine the total time Jeremy takes to get to his parents' house, we need to consider both his driving time and the time spent on rest stops and refueling.

Since he drives for 12 hours, he will make:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12 \\text{ hours}}{2 \\text{ hours per rest stop}} = 6 \\text{ rest stops}\n   \\]\n   However, he does not make a rest stop after his final hour of driving, so he makes only 5 rest stops.\n\n3. **Calculate the total time spent on rest stops:**\n   Each rest stop takes 15 minutes, so for 5 rest stops, the total time spent on rest stops is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ rest stops} \\times 15 \\text{ minutes per rest stop} = 75 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of times Jeremy needs to refuel:**\n   Jeremy's car gets 18 miles per gallon, and his gas indicator comes on when he has used 15 gallons.

        "To determine the total time Jeremy takes to drive 600 miles to visit his parents, we need to consider both his driving time and the time spent on rest stops and refueling.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total driving time.

Since he makes a rest stop every 2 hours, the number of rest stops is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of rest stops} = \\frac{12 \\text{ hours}}{2 \\text{ hours per rest stop}} = 6\n\\]\nHowever, since he does not make a rest stop after he arrives, he only makes 5 rest stops. The total time spent on rest stops is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent on rest stops} = 5 \\text{ rest stops} \\times 15 \\text{ minutes per rest stop} = 75 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine the number of times Jeremy needs to refuel. Since his car gets 18 miles per gallon and his gas indicator comes on when he has used 15 gallons, the car uses:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ gallons} \\times 18 \\text{ miles per gallon} = 270 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\nTherefore, he needs to refuel after every 270 miles. The number of times he needs to refuel is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of refuels} = \\frac{600 \\text{ miles}}{270 \\text{ miles per refuel}} = 2.22\n\\]\nSince he cannot refuel a fraction of a time, he needs to refuel 2 times. The total time spent refueling is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent refueling} = 2 \\text{ refuels} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes per refuel} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add up the driving time, the time spent on rest stops, and the time spent refueling to get the total time Jeremy takes to get to his parents' house:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = 12 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} + 75 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} = 720 \\text{ minutes} + 75 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} = 815 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time Jeremy takes to get to his parents' house is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{815}\n\\]",

Jeremy makes a rest stop every 2 hours. Since he drives for 12 hours, we divide the total driving time by the interval between rest stops:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of rest stops} = \\frac{12 \\text{ hours}}{2 \\text{ hours per rest stop}} = 6\n\\]\nHowever, he does not make a rest stop at the end of his trip, so the actual number of rest stops is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of rest stops} = 6 - 1 = 5\n\\]\nThe total time spent on rest stops is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total rest stop time} = 5 \\text{ rest stops} \\times 15 \\text{ minutes per rest stop} = 75 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the number of times Jeremy needs to refuel. His car gets 18 miles per gallon, and his gas indicator comes on when he has used 15 gallons. Therefore, the distance he can drive before needing to refuel is:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance per refuel} = 18 \\text{ miles per gallon} \\times 15 \\text{ gallons} = 270 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\nThe number of times he needs to refuel is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of refuels} = \\frac{600 \\text{ miles}}{270 \\text{ miles per refuel}} \\approx 2.22\n\\]\nSince he cannot refuel a fraction of a time, he needs to refuel 3 times (once at 270 miles, once at 540 miles, and once at 810 miles, but since he only travels 600 miles, the last refuel is not needed).\nTherefore, he actually needs to refuel 2 times. The total time spent refueling is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total refueling time} = 2 \\text{ refuels} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes per refuel} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, add up all the times to get the total travel time:\n\\[\n\\text{Total travel time} = \\text{Driving time} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} + \\text{Total rest stop time} + \\text{Total refueling time} = 12 \\times 60 + 75 + 20 = 720 + 75 + 20 = 815 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time Jeremy takes to get to his parents' house is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{815}\n\\]"
