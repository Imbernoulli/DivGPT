        "First, we need to determine the depth of the hole that Michael's father dug. The father dug at a rate of 4 feet per hour and took 400 hours to complete the hole. Therefore, the depth of the father's hole is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ feet/hour} \\times 400 \\text{ hours} = 1600 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the depth of the hole that Michael wants to dig. According to the problem, Michael wants to dig a hole that is 400 feet less deep than twice the depth of his father's hole. First, we calculate twice the depth of the father's hole:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 1600 \\text{ feet} = 3200 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThen, we subtract 400 feet from this depth to find the depth of Michael's hole:\n\n\\[\n3200 \\text{ feet} - 400 \\text{ feet} = 2800 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how long it will take Michael to dig a hole that is 2800 feet deep, working at the same rate of 4 feet per hour. We do this by dividing the depth of Michael's hole by his digging rate:\n\n\\[\n2800 \\text{ feet} \\div 4 \\text{ feet/hour} = 700 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Michael \\(\\boxed{700}\\) hours to dig the hole.",

To find out how many hours it will take Michael to dig his hole, we divide the depth of his hole by his digging rate:\n\n\\[\n2800 \\text{ feet} \\div 4 \\text{ feet/hour} = 700 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Michael \\(\\boxed{700}\\) hours to dig his hole.",
        "To determine how many hours it will take for Michael to dig a hole, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the depth of the hole that the father dug.\n2. Determine the depth of the hole that Michael wants to dig.\n3. Calculate the time it will take for Michael to dig his hole.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the depth of the hole that the father dug.
