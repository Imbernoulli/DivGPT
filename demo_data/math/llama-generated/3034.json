        "To determine the smallest percentage of the female vote June must receive to win the election, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of votes needed to win:**\n   Since June needs just over 50% of the vote to win, we need more than half of the 200 students.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Votes needed} = \\frac{50}{100} \\times 200 + 1 = 101\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of boys and girls in the school:**\n   There are 200 students, and 60% are boys.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of boys} = 0.60 \\times 200 = 120\n   \\]\n   The rest are girls.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 120 = 80\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of votes June receives from the boys:**\n   June receives 67.5% of the male vote.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Votes from boys} = 0.675 \\times 120 = 81\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of votes June needs from the girls:**\n   June needs a total of 101 votes to win. She already has 81 votes from the boys.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Votes needed from girls} = 101 - 81 = 20\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the percentage of the female vote June needs:**\n   To find the percentage of the female vote, we divide the number of votes needed from the girls by the total number of girls and then multiply by 100.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage of female vote needed} = \\left( \\frac{20}{80} \\right) \\times 100 = 25\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the smallest percentage of the female vote June must receive to win the election is \\(\\boxed{25\\%}\\).",
