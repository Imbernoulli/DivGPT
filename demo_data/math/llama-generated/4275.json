        "To determine how many kilograms of rice Mr. Llesis kept compared to Mr. Everest, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of rice Mr. Llesis kept in storage.\n2. Calculate the amount of rice Mr. Everest received.\n3. Find the difference between the amount of rice Mr. Llesis kept and the amount Mr. Everest received.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of rice Mr. Llesis kept in storage. Mr. Llesis had 50 kilograms of rice and he kept \\(\\frac{7}{10}\\) of it.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rice kept in storage} = 50 \\times \\frac{7}{10} = 50 \\times 0.7 = 35 \\text{ kilograms}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of rice Mr. Everest received. Since Mr. Llesis gave away the remaining rice, we need to subtract the amount he kept from the total amount of rice.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rice given to Mr. Everest} = 50 - 35 = 15 \\text{ kilograms}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the amount of rice Mr. Llesis kept and the amount Mr. Everest received.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 35 - 15 = 20 \\text{ kilograms}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mr. Llesis kept \\(\\boxed{20}\\) kilograms of rice more than Mr. Everest.",
