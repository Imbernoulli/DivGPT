        "To determine the total number of miles Vins rode his bike this week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the distance Vins rides in one round trip (to school and back home).\n2. Multiply the distance of one round trip by the number of times he made the round trip in the week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance of one round trip:\n- Vins rides 6 miles to school.\n- Vins rides 7 miles back home.\n- Therefore, the total distance for one round trip is \\(6 + 7 = 13\\) miles.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many miles Vins rides in a week. Since he rides to school and back 5 times, we multiply the distance of one round trip by 5:\n\\[13 \\times 5 = 65\\]\n\nSo, the total number of miles Vins rode his bike this week is \\(\\boxed{65}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of miles Vins rode his bike this week, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1.
