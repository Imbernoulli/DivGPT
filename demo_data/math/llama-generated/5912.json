        "To determine what percentage of the flyers Belinda passed out, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of flyers passed out by Ryan, Alyssa, and Scott.\n2. Subtract this total from the overall number of flyers to find out how many flyers Belinda passed out.\n3. Divide the number of flyers Belinda passed out by the total number of flyers and then multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total flyers passed out by Ryan, Alyssa, and Scott} = 42 + 67 + 51 \\]\n\nAdding these together:\n\n\\[ 42 + 67 = 109 \\]\n\\[ 109 + 51 = 160 \\]\n\nSo, Ryan, Alyssa, and Scott passed out 160 flyers in total.\n\nNext, we subtract this total from the overall number of flyers to find out how many flyers Belinda passed out:\n\n\\[ \\text{Flyers passed out by Belinda} = 200 - 160 \\]\n\nSubtracting these:\n\n\\[ 200 - 160 = 40 \\]\n\nSo, Belinda passed out 40 flyers.\n\nNow, we divide the number of flyers Belinda passed out by the total number of flyers and then multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of flyers passed out by Belinda} = \\left( \\frac{40}{200} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{40}{200} = \\frac{1}{5} \\]\n\nThen, multiplying by 100:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\right) \\times 100 = 20\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the flyers that Belinda passed out is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
