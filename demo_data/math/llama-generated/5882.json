        "To determine the number of yellow leaves Bronson collects, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of leaves collected.\n2. Determine the number of brown leaves.\n3. Determine the number of green leaves.\n4. Subtract the number of brown and green leaves from the total number of leaves to find the number of yellow leaves.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of leaves collected:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ (Thursday)} + 13 \\text{ (Friday)} = 25 \\text{ leaves}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of brown leaves. Since 20% of the leaves are brown, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 25 = 5 \\text{ brown leaves}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, we determine the number of green leaves. Since 20% of the leaves are green, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 25 = 5 \\text{ green leaves}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of brown and green leaves from the total number of leaves to find the number of yellow leaves:\n\\[\n25 - 5 - 5 = 15 \\text{ yellow leaves}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of yellow leaves Bronson collects is \\boxed{15}.",
