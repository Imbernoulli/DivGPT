Determine how much money Mike spends on arcade tokens.\n3. Calculate how many hours Mike can play with the money spent on tokens.\n4. Convert the hours into minutes.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Mike gets paid $100 a week and spends half of that at the arcade:\n\\[ 100 \\div 2 = 50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount he spends on food from the total amount spent at the arcade:\n\\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many hours Mike can play with the $40 he has left for tokens. Since it costs $8 per hour, we divide the amount of money spent on tokens by the hourly rate:\n\\[ 40 \\div 8 = 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the hours into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the number of hours by 60:\n\\[ 5 \\times 60 = 300 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of minutes Mike can play is:\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]",

        "To determine how many minutes Mike can play at the arcade, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount Mike spends at the arcade:**\n   Mike gets paid $100 a week and spends half of it at the arcade.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent at the arcade} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how much Mike spends on food:**\n   Mike spends $10 at the arcade on food.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on food} = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how much Mike spends on arcade tokens:**\n   Subtract the amount spent on food from the total amount spent at the arcade.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on tokens} = 50 - 10 = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many hours Mike can play with the tokens:**\n   Mike pays $8 per hour to play at the arcade.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hours of play} = \\frac{40}{8} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert hours to minutes:**\n   There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Minutes of play} = 5 \\times 60 = 300 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Mike can play for \\(\\boxed{300}\\) minutes."
