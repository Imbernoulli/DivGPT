        "To determine how many minutes Andy spent blowing up balloons, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of balloons Andy blew up:**\n   - Ashley initially blew up 12 balloons.\n   - When Andy stopped, there were 50 balloons in total.\n   - Therefore, the number of balloons Andy blew up is:\n     \\[\n     50 - 12 = 38\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the rate at which Andy blew up the balloons:**\n   - Andy blows up 2 balloons every 5 minutes.\n\n3. **Calculate the total time Andy spent blowing up the balloons:**\n   - Since Andy blows up 2 balloons in 5 minutes, we need to find out how many 5-minute intervals are required to blow up 38 balloons.\n   - The number of 5-minute intervals is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{38}{2} = 19\n     \\]\n   - Each interval is 5 minutes, so the total time spent is:\n     \\[\n     19 \\times 5 = 95\n     \\]\n\nThus, Andy spent \\(\\boxed{95}\\) minutes blowing up balloons.",
        "To determine how many minutes Andy spent blowing up balloons, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of balloons Andy blew up.\n2. Determine the time it took Andy to blow up those balloons.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many balloons Andy blew up.

Therefore, the number of balloons Andy blew up is:\n\n\\[ 50 - 12 = 38 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Andy blows up balloons at a rate of 2 balloons every 5 minutes. To find out how many minutes Andy spent blowing up balloons, we need to determine how many 5-minute intervals are required to blow up 38 balloons. We do this by dividing the total number of balloons Andy blew up by the rate at which he blows up balloons:\n\n\\[ \\frac{38}{2} = 19 \\]\n\nThis result tells us that Andy blew up balloons for 19 intervals of 5 minutes each.
