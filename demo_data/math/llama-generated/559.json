        "To determine how much longer Nick's cell phone must be charged to reach 100% charge, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the initial charge and the charge rate:**\n   - Nick's cell phone was initially empty.\n   - After being charged for 45 minutes, it reached a 25% charge.\n\n2. **Calculate the charge rate:**\n   - The cell phone charges from 0% to 25% in 45 minutes.\n   - Therefore, the charge rate is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{25\\%}{45 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1\\%}{1.8 \\text{ minutes}}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the remaining charge needed:**\n   - The cell phone is currently at 25% charge.\n   - To reach 100% charge, it needs:\n     \\[\n     100\\% - 25\\% = 75\\%\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the time required to charge the remaining 75%:**\n   - Using the charge rate, we need to find the time \\( t \\) to charge 75%:\n     \\[\n     t = 75\\% \\times 1.8 \\text{ minutes per percent}\n     \\]\n   - Perform the multiplication:\n     \\[\n     t = 75 \\times 1.8 = 135 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the cell phone must be charged for an additional \\(\\boxed{135}\\) minutes to reach 100% charge.",

The difference in charge needed is:\n\n\\[\n100\\% - 25\\% = 75\\%\n\\]\n\nSince the charging rate is \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\) percent per minute, the time required to charge the remaining 75% is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time required} = \\frac{75\\%}{\\frac{5}{9} \\text{ percent per minute}} = 75 \\times \\frac{9}{5} = 135 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cell phone must be charged for an additional \\(\\boxed{135}\\) minutes to reach 100% charge.",

To find out how much longer is needed to charge the phone from 25% to 100%, we calculate the remaining charge:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining charge} = 100\\% - 25\\% = 75\\%\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the charging rate to determine how many minutes are required to charge the remaining 75%:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time needed} = 75\\% \\times 1.8 \\text{ minutes per 1%} = 75 \\times 1.8 = 135 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cell phone must be charged for an additional \\(\\boxed{135}\\) minutes to reach 100% charge.",
