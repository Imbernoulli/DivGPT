        "To determine the total number of hours Ralph spends watching TV in one week, we need to calculate the hours he watches TV from Monday to Friday and the hours he watches TV on Saturday and Sunday separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the hours Ralph spends watching TV from Monday to Friday. He watches TV for 4 hours each day for 5 days:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 20 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the hours Ralph spends watching TV on Saturday and Sunday.
