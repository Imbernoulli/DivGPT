We know that the first dog eats 13 pounds per week and the second dog eats double that amount. Therefore, the second dog eats:\n\n\\[ 13 \\text{ pounds} \\times 2 = 26 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNow, we add the amounts of food consumed by the first and second dogs to find out how much food they eat together:\n\n\\[ 13 \\text{ pounds} + 26 \\text{ pounds} = 39 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTo find out how much food the third dog eats per week, we subtract the total amount of food consumed by the first and second dogs from the total amount of food consumed by all three dogs:\n\n\\[ 45 \\text{ pounds} - 39 \\text{ pounds} = 6 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the third dog eats \\(\\boxed{6}\\) pounds of food per week.",
