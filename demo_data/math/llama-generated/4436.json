        "To determine how much money was originally in the cookie jar, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much money Martha spent.\n2. Determine the total amount of money spent by Doris and Martha.\n3. Add the remaining amount of money in the cookie jar to the total amount spent.\n\nFirst, we know that Doris spent $6. Martha spent half as much as Doris, so we calculate Martha's spending as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Martha's spending} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we find the total amount of money spent by both Doris and Martha:\n\\[ \\text{Total spending} = \\text{Doris's spending} + \\text{Martha's spending} = 6 + 3 = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nWe know that after Doris and Martha spent their money, there were $15 left in the cookie jar. Therefore, the original amount of money in the cookie jar is the sum of the total spending and the remaining money:\n\\[ \\text{Original amount} = \\text{Total spending} + \\text{Remaining money} = 9 + 15 = 24 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the original amount of money in the cookie jar was \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
