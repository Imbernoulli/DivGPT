First, we know that the cat spends 20 minutes resisting.\n2. Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the cat to walk 64 feet at a rate of 8 feet per minute. We can do this by dividing the distance by the rate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time to walk 64 feet} = \\frac{64 \\text{ feet}}{8 \\text{ feet/minute}} = 8 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\n3. Now, we add the time the cat spends resisting to the time it takes to walk 64 feet:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = 20 \\text{ minutes} + 8 \\text{ minutes} = 28 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the whole process takes \\(\\boxed{28}\\) minutes."
