        "To determine how many apples Tom has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many apples Ben has.\n2. Use the number of apples Ben has to find out how many apples Tom has.\n\nFirst, we know that Phillip has 40 apples. Since Ben has 8 more apples than Phillip, we can calculate the number of apples Ben has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of apples Ben has} = \\text{Number of apples Phillip has} + 8 = 40 + 8 = 48\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Tom has three eighths as many apples as Ben.
