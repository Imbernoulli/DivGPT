        "To determine the number of marbles of a different color in the box, we start by calculating the number of marbles of each color given in the problem.\n\n1. **Red Marbles:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Red marbles} = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. **Green Marbles:**\n   There are three times more green marbles than red marbles.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Green marbles} = 3 \\times \\text{Red marbles} = 3 \\times 20 = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. **Yellow Marbles:**\n   Yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Yellow marbles} = 0.20 \\times \\text{Green marbles} = 0.20 \\times 60 = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Marbles in the Box:**\n   The total number of marbles is three times more than the number of green marbles.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total marbles} = 3 \\times \\text{Green marbles} = 3 \\times 60 = 180\n   \\]\n\n5. **Marbles of a Different Color:**\n   To find the number of marbles of a different color, we subtract the number of red, green, and yellow marbles from the total number of marbles.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Marbles of a different color} = \\text{Total marbles} - (\\text{Red marbles} + \\text{Green marbles} + \\text{Yellow marbles})\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Marbles of a different color} = 180 - (20 + 60 + 12) = 180 - 92 = 88\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of marbles of a different color is \\(\\boxed{88}\\).",
        "To determine the number of marbles of a different color, we start by calculating the number of green marbles. We know there are 20 red marbles and three times more green marbles than red. Therefore, the number of green marbles is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 3 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of yellow marbles. Yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles. So, the number of yellow marbles is:\n\\[ 60 \\times 0.20 = 12 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of marbles in the box.

Therefore, the total number of marbles is:\n\\[ 60 \\times 3 = 180 \\]\n\nTo find the number of marbles of a different color, we subtract the number of red, green, and yellow marbles from the total number of marbles. The number of marbles of a different color is:\n\\[ 180 - (20 + 60 + 12) = 180 - 92 = 88 \\]\n\nThus, the number of marbles of a different color is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88} \\]",
