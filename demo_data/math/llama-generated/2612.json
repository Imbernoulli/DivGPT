Since \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the total number of people left:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5} \\times 50 = 20 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nWe know that 9 men left the party. Therefore, the number of women who left the party is:\n\\[ 20 - 9 = 11 \\text{ women} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate how many men and women stayed at the party. The number of men who stayed is:\n\\[ 20 - 9 = 11 \\text{ men} \\]\nThe number of women who stayed is:\n\\[ 30 - 11 = 19 \\text{ women} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of women and men who stayed at the party:\n\\[ 19 - 11 = 8 \\]\n\nThus, the number of more women who stayed at the party than men is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",

We know that 9 men left the party. To find out how many women left the party, we subtract the number of men who left from the total number of people who left:\n\n\\[ 20 - 9 = 11 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of women who stayed at the party. Initially, there were 30 women, and 11 women left, so the number of women who stayed is:\n\n\\[ 30 - 11 = 19 \\]\n\nSimilarly, we calculate the number of men who stayed at the party. Initially, there were 20 men, and 9 men left, so the number of men who stayed is:\n\n\\[ 20 - 9 = 11 \\]\n\nFinally, we find out how many more women stayed at the party than men by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the number of women who stayed:\n\n\\[ 19 - 11 = 8 \\]\n\nThus, the number of women who stayed at the party is 8 more than the number of men who stayed.
