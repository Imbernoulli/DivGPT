        "To determine the number of daisies in each bouquet of daisies, we start by calculating the total number of roses sold. Since each rose bouquet contains 12 roses and the flower shop sold 10 rose bouquets, the total number of roses sold is:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 12 = 120 \\]\n\nNext, we know that the total number of flowers sold is 190. Therefore, the total number of daisies sold is:\n\n\\[ 190 - 120 = 70 \\]\n\nSince the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of daisies, we can find the number of daisies in each bouquet by dividing the total number of daisies sold by the number of daisy bouquets:\n\n\\[ \\frac{70}{10} = 7 \\]\n\nThus, the number of daisies in each bouquet of daisies is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",

        "To determine how many daisies are in each bouquet of daisies, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of daisies in each bouquet of daisies. According to the problem, the flower shop sold 10 bouquets of roses and 10 bouquets of daisies, and the total number of flowers sold is 190. Since each bouquet of roses contains 12 roses, the total number of roses sold is \\( 10 \\times 12 = 120 \\). The total number of daisies sold is \\( 10 \\times x = 10x \\). The sum of the roses and daisies sold is equal to 190, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\n120 + 10x = 190\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by isolating the variable. First, we subtract 120 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n10x = 190 - 120\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n10x = 70\n\\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 10:\n\n\\[\nx = 7\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of daisies in each bouquet of daisies is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
        "To determine how many daisies are in each bouquet of daisies, we start by defining the number of daisies in each bouquet of daisies as \\( x \\).\n\nThe flower shop sells 10 bouquets of roses, and each bouquet contains 12 roses. Therefore, the total number of roses sold is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 12 = 120 \\]\n\nThe flower shop also sells 10 bouquets of daisies, and each bouquet contains \\( x \\) daisies. Therefore, the total number of daisies sold is:\n\\[ 10 \\times x = 10x \\]\n\nThe total number of flowers sold is the sum of the roses and the daisies, which is given as 190. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 120 + 10x = 190 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we first isolate the term with \\( x \\) by subtracting 120 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 10x = 190 - 120 \\]\n\\[ 10x = 70 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 10:\n\\[ x = \\frac{70}{10} \\]\n\\[ x = 7 \\]\n\nThus, the number of daisies in each bouquet of daisies is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
