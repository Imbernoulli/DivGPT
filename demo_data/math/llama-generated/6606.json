        "To determine how many more minutes Matt worked on Wednesday than on Tuesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of minutes Matt worked on Tuesday:**\n   On Monday, Matt worked for 450 minutes. On Tuesday, he worked half the number of minutes he worked on Monday. Therefore, we need to find half of 450 minutes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Minutes worked on Tuesday} = \\frac{450}{2} = 225 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of minutes Matt worked on Wednesday:**\n   On Wednesday, Matt worked for 300 minutes.\n\n3. **Find the difference in the number of minutes worked between Wednesday and Tuesday:**\n   To find out how many more minutes Matt worked on Wednesday than on Tuesday, we subtract the number of minutes he worked on Tuesday from the number of minutes he worked on Wednesday:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 300 - 225 = 75 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Matt worked \\(\\boxed{75}\\) more minutes on Wednesday than on Tuesday.",
