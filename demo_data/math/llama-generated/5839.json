        "To determine how many badminton medals Jameson has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of track medals Jameson has.\n   Jameson has 5 track medals.\n\n2. Calculate the number of swimming medals Jameson has.\n   Jameson has two times as many swimming medals as track medals. Therefore, the number of swimming medals is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 5 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. Determine the total number of track and swimming medals.\n   Adding the number of track medals and swimming medals gives:\n   \\[\n   5 + 10 = 15\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the number of badminton medals.\n   The rest of the medals are for badminton. Since Jameson has 20 medals in total, the number of badminton medals is:\n   \\[\n   20 - 15 = 5\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of badminton medals Jameson has is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
