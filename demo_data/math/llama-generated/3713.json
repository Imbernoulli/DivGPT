        "To determine the number of trees currently on Bea's farm, we start by defining the number of Mahogany and Narra trees that fell during the typhoon. Let \\( x \\) be the number of Narra trees that fell. Then, the number of Mahogany trees that fell is \\( x + 1 \\). According to the problem, the total number of trees that fell is 5. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x + (x + 1) = 5 \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 2x + 1 = 5 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 4 \\]\n\\[ x = 2 \\]\n\nSo, 2 Narra trees fell and \\( 2 + 1 = 3 \\) Mahogany trees fell. After the typhoon, Bea's mom planted twice as many Narra trees as the number of Narra trees that fell, which is \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\) Narra trees. She also planted thrice the number of Mahogany trees that fell, which is \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) Mahogany trees. Initially, there were 50 Mahogany trees and 30 Narra trees. After the typhoon, the number of Mahogany trees left is \\( 50 - 3 = 47 \\) and the number of Narra trees left is \\( 30 - 2 = 28 \\). Adding the newly planted trees, the number of Mahogany trees now is \\( 47 + 9 = 56 \\) and the number of Narra trees now is \\( 28 + 4 = 32 \\). Therefore, the total number of trees now on the farm is:\n\n\\[ 56 + 32 = 88 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{88} \\]",

Set up equations based on the given information.\n3. Solve the equations to find the number of each type of tree that fell.\n4. Calculate the number of trees planted after the typhoon.\n5. Determine the total number of trees currently on the farm.\n\nLet's denote the number of Narra trees that fell as \\( n \\). According to the problem, one more Mahogany tree fell than the number of Narra trees that fell, so the number of Mahogany trees that fell is \\( n + 1 \\).\n\nThe total number of trees that fell is 5, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ n + (n + 1) = 5 \\]\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\\[ 2n + 1 = 5 \\]\nSubtracting 1 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ 2n = 4 \\]\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\\[ n = 2 \\]\n\nSo, 2 Narra trees fell, and \\( n + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 \\) Mahogany trees fell.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of trees planted after the typhoon. Bea's mom planted twice as many Narra trees as the number of Narra trees that fell, which is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\]\nShe also planted three times as many Mahogany trees as the number of Mahogany trees that fell, which is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nThe total number of trees planted is:\n\\[ 4 + 9 = 13 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the total number of trees currently on the farm. Initially, there were 50 Mahogany trees and 30 Narra trees, making a total of:\n\\[ 50 + 30 = 80 \\]\nAfter the typhoon, 5 trees fell, so the number of trees left is:\n\\[ 80 - 5 = 75 \\]\nAfter planting 13 new trees, the total number of trees now on the farm is:\n\\[ 75 + 13 = 88 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of trees now on the farm is \\(\\boxed{88}\\).",
        "Let's start by defining the variables for the number of Mahogany and Narra trees that fell. Let \\( x \\) be the number of Narra trees that fell. Since one more Mahogany tree fell than the number of Narra trees, the number of Mahogany trees that fell is \\( x + 1 \\).\n\nThe total number of trees that fell is given as 5. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ x + (x + 1) = 5 \\]\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\\[ 2x + 1 = 5 \\]\nSubtracting 1 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ 2x = 4 \\]\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\\[ x = 2 \\]\nSo, the number of Narra trees that fell is 2, and the number of Mahogany trees that fell is \\( x + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 \\).\n\nNext, we need to determine how many trees Bea's mom planted after the typhoon. She planted twice as many Narra trees as the number of Narra trees that fell, which is \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\). She also planted thrice the number of Mahogany trees that fell, which is \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\). Therefore, the total number of trees she planted is \\( 4 + 9 = 13 \\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of trees currently on the farm. Initially, there were 50 Mahogany trees and 30 Narra trees, making a total of \\( 50 + 30 = 80 \\) trees. After the typhoon, 3 Mahogany trees and 2 Narra trees fell, so the number of trees left is \\( 80 - (3 + 2) = 80 - 5 = 75 \\). Adding the 13 trees that Bea's mom planted, the total number of trees now on the farm is \\( 75 + 13 = 88 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of trees now on the farm is \\(\\boxed{88}\\).",
