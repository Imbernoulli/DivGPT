        "To determine the total amount of fuel Mary used over the two weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of fuel Mary used last week.\n2. Add the amount of fuel used last week to the amount of fuel used this week.\n\nFirst, we know that Mary used 15 gallons of fuel this week. Last week, she used 20% less than this week. To find out how much fuel she used last week, we need to calculate 20% of 15 gallons and subtract it from 15 gallons.\n\nThe calculation for 20% of 15 gallons is:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 15 = 3 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nSo, the amount of fuel Mary used last week is:\n\\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNow, we add the amount of fuel used last week to the amount of fuel used this week to find the total fuel usage over the two weeks:\n\\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of fuel Mary used in the two weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{27} \\]",

Add the amount of fuel used last week to the amount of fuel used this week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of fuel Mary used last week. We know that she used 20% less fuel last week compared to this week. Since she used 15 gallons this week, we can find out how much less fuel she used last week by calculating 20% of 15 gallons.\n\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } 15 = 0.20 \\times 15 = 3 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nSince she used 20% less fuel last week, we subtract this amount from the 15 gallons she used this week.\n\n\\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nSo, Mary used 12 gallons of fuel last week. Now, we add the amount of fuel used last week to the amount of fuel used this week to find the total amount of fuel used over the two weeks.\n\n\\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of fuel Mary used in the two weeks is \\(\\boxed{27}\\).",

Therefore, last week she used:\n\n\\[ 15 \\text{ gallons} - (0.20 \\times 15 \\text{ gallons}) \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 0.20 \\times 15 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 15 = 3 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nSo, last week she used:\n\n\\[ 15 \\text{ gallons} - 3 \\text{ gallons} = 12 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNow, we add the amount of fuel used last week to the amount used this week:\n\n\\[ 15 \\text{ gallons} + 12 \\text{ gallons} = 27 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of fuel Mary used for the two weeks is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{27} \\]",
