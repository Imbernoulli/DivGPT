They agree to split any money they earn. They sell them based on how many circles are on top. Each circle costs 1 cent. They earned $5 each after selling 100 single pieces, 45 double pieces, 50 triple pieces and a number of quadruple pieces. How many quadruple pieces did they sell?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
