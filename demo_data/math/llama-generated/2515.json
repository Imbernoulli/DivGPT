        "To determine how many minutes faster Samuel finished his homework compared to Sarah, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert Sarah's time into minutes:**\n   Sarah took 1.3 hours to finish her homework. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert hours to minutes by multiplying:\n   \\[\n   1.3 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 78 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the difference in time:**\n   Samuel took 30 minutes to finish his homework, and Sarah took 78 minutes. To find out how many minutes faster Samuel finished, we subtract the time Samuel took from the time Sarah took:\n   \\[\n   78 \\text{ minutes} - 30 \\text{ minutes} = 48 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Samuel finished his homework \\(\\boxed{48}\\) minutes faster than Sarah.",
