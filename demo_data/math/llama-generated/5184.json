The total number of marbles is:\n\n\\[\n21 + 38 + 4 = 63\n\\]\n\nThis matches the total number of marbles Fred has. Therefore, the number of red marbles is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{38}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many of Fred's marbles are red, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of dark blue marbles.\n2. Determine the number of marbles that are not dark blue.\n3. Subtract the number of green marbles from the number of marbles that are not dark blue to find the number of red marbles.\n\nFirst, we know that at least a third of Fred's marbles are dark blue.

        "To determine how many of Fred's marbles are red, we start by calculating the minimum number of dark blue marbles. Since at least a third of Fred's marbles are dark blue, we can find this minimum number by dividing the total number of marbles by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{63}{3} = 21\n\\]\n\nSo, Fred has at least 21 dark blue marbles.

Let's denote the number of dark blue marbles as \\( B \\). Therefore, \\( B \\geq 21 \\).\n\nNext, we need to find out how many marbles are not dark blue.

Let's assume he has exactly 21 dark blue marbles (since it is the minimum possible). The remaining marbles are either red or green. Since there are 4 green marbles, the number of red marbles can be calculated by subtracting the number of dark blue marbles and green marbles from the total number of marbles:\n\n\\[\n63 - 21 - 4 = 38\n\\]\n\nTherefore, if Fred has exactly 21 dark blue marbles, he has 38 red marbles. To confirm, let's check if having more than 21 dark blue marbles would change the number of red marbles. If Fred had more than 21 dark blue marbles, the number of red marbles would be less than 38, but the problem does not specify an exact number of dark blue marbles beyond the minimum of 21.

Therefore, \\( x \\geq 21 \\).\n\nNext, we know that all of the marbles that are not dark blue are either red or green. The problem states that there are 4 green marbles. Thus, the number of red marbles is given by the total number of marbles minus the number of dark blue marbles minus the number of green marbles. We can express this as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red marbles} = 63 - x - 4 = 59 - x\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\geq 21 \\), the maximum number of red marbles occurs when \\( x \\) is at its minimum value, which is 21.

        "To determine how many of Fred's marbles are red, we start by calculating the minimum number of dark blue marbles. Since at least a third of Fred's marbles are dark blue, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 63 = 21\n\\]\n\nSo, Fred has at least 21 dark blue marbles. Let's denote the number of dark blue marbles by \\( x \\). Therefore, \\( x \\geq 21 \\).\n\nNext, we know that all of the remaining marbles are red, except for 4 that are green. The total number of marbles is 63, so the number of red marbles is:\n\n\\[\n63 - x - 4 = 59 - x\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\geq 21 \\), the smallest possible value for \\( x \\) is 21. Substituting \\( x = 21 \\) into the equation for the number of red marbles, we get:\n\n\\[\n59 - 21 = 38\n\\]\n\nTo ensure that this is the only solution, we check if \\( x \\) can be greater than 21. If \\( x \\) were greater than 21, the number of red marbles would be less than 38, but since we are asked how many of them are red, and we have calculated that the minimum number of dark blue marbles is 21, the number of red marbles must be:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{38}\n\\]",

Then \\( x \\geq 21 \\). The total number of marbles is 63, and the remaining marbles after accounting for the dark blue ones are \\( 63 - x \\). According to the problem, all of the remaining marbles are red, except for 4 that are green. Therefore, the number of red marbles is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red marbles} = 63 - x - 4 = 59 - x\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\geq 21 \\), the smallest possible value for \\( x \\) is 21. Substituting \\( x = 21 \\) into the equation for the number of red marbles, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red marbles} = 59 - 21 = 38\n\\]\n\nTo verify, if \\( x = 21 \\), then the number of dark blue marbles is 21, the number of green marbles is 4, and the number of red marbles is 38. The total number of marbles is:\n\n\\[\n21 + 4 + 38 = 63\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that our solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red marbles is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{38}\n\\]",

Since Fred has 63 marbles, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{63}{3} = 21\n\\]\n\nSo, Fred has at least 21 dark blue marbles. Next, we need to find out how many marbles are not dark blue. Since the total number of marbles is 63, the number of marbles that are not dark blue is:\n\n\\[\n63 - 21 = 42\n\\]\n\nAll of the marbles that are not dark blue are either red or green. The problem states that there are 4 green marbles. Therefore, the number of red marbles is:\n\n\\[\n42 - 4 = 38\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of red marbles Fred has is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{38}\n\\]",

Let's denote the number of dark blue marbles as \\( D \\). Therefore, \\( D \\geq 21 \\).\n\nThe total number of marbles is 63, and the rest of the marbles are red and green. If \\( R \\) is the number of red marbles and \\( G \\) is the number of green marbles, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\nD + R + G = 63\n\\]\n\nWe know that \\( G = 4 \\) (since there are 4 green marbles). Substituting \\( G \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nD + R + 4 = 63\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we obtain:\n\n\\[\nD + R = 59\n\\]\n\nSince \\( D \\geq 21 \\), the smallest possible value for \\( D \\) is 21. Substituting \\( D = 21 \\) into the equation \\( D + R = 59 \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n21 + R = 59\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 21 from both sides, we find:\n\n\\[\nR = 38\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of red marbles is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",
        "To determine the number of red marbles Fred has, we start by analyzing the information given:\n\n1. Fred has a total of 63 marbles.\n2. At least a third of Fred's marbles are dark blue.\n3. All marbles that are not dark blue are red, except for 4 that are green.\n\nFirst, we calculate the minimum number of dark blue marbles. Since at least a third of the marbles are dark blue:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 63 = 21\n\\]\nThus, Fred has at least 21 dark blue marbles.\n\nNext, we determine the maximum number ofwoods marbles that are not dark blue. Since Fred has at least 21 dark blue marbles:\n\\[\n63 - 21 = 42\n\\]\nThis means there are at most 42 marbles that are not dark blue.\n\nOut of these 42 marbles that are not dark blue, 4 are green. Therefore, the number of red marbles is:\n\\[\n42 - 4 = 38\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of red marbles Fred has is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",

Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 63 = 21\n   \\]\n   So, Fred has at least 21 dark blue marbles.\n\n3. **Green marbles**: There are 4 green marbles.\n\n4. **Red marbles**: All marbles that are not dark blue are red, except for the green marbles. First, we find the total number of marbles that are not dark blue:\n   \\[\n   63 - 21 = 42\n   \\]\n   Since 4 of these 42 marbles are green, the number of red marbles is:\n   \\[\n   42 - 4 = 38\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of red marbles Fred has is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",

Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 63 = 21\n   \\]\n   So, Fred has at least 21 dark blue marbles.\n\n3. **Green marbles**: Fred has exactly 4 green marbles.\n\n4. **Red marbles**: All marbles that are not dark blue are either red or green. Since we know the total number of marbles and the number of green marbles, we can express the number of red marbles as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red marbles} = \\text{Total number of marbles} - \\text{Number of dark blue marbles} - \\text{Number of green marbles}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substitute the known values**:\n   - Total number of marbles: 63\n   - Minimum number of dark blue marbles: 21\n   - Number of green marbles: 4\n\n   Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red marbles} = 63 - 21 - 4\n   \\]\n\n6. **Perform the calculation**:\n   \\[\n   63 - 21 = 42\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   42 - 4 = 38\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of red marbles is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",
        "To determine how many of Fred's marbles are red, we start by identifying the number of dark blue marbles. According to the problem, at least a third of Fred's marbles are dark blue. Since Fred has 63 marbles, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{63}{3} = 21\n\\]\n\nThis means that Fred has at least 21 dark blue marbles. For simplicity, we assume he has exactly 21 dark blue marbles (since having more would only increase the number of red marbles, which we will verifymitter).\n\nNext, we know that the rest of the marbles are either red or green. Since there are 4 green marbles, we can find the number of red marbles by subtracting the number of dark blue marbles and green marbles from the total number of marbles:\n\n\\[\n63 - 21 - 4 = 38\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of red marbles is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).\n\nTo verify, we check if having more than 21 dark blue marbles would still give a logical answer. If Fred had more than 21 dark blue marbles, the number of red marbles would decrease. For example, if he had 22 dark blue marbles:\n\n\\[\n63 - 22 - 4 = 37\n\\]\n\nIf he had 60 dark blue marbles:\n\n\\[\n63 - 60 - 4 = -1\n\\]\n\nThis is not possible since the number of marbles cannot be negative.

        "To determine how many of Fred's marbles are red, we start by calculating the minimum number of dark blue marbles he has. According to the problem, at least a third of Fred's marbles are dark blue. Since Fred has 63 marbles, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 63 = 21\n\\]\n\nThis means Fred has at least 21 dark blue marbles. Let's denote the number of dark blue marbles as \\( B \\). Therefore, \\( B \\geq 21 \\).\n\nNext, we know that all the remaining marbles are red, except for 4 that are green. The total number of marbles is 63, so the number of marbles that are either red or green is:\n\n\\[\n63 - B\n\\]\n\nSince 4 of these marbles are green, the number of red marbles is:\n\n\\[\n63 - B - 4 = 59 - B\n\\]\n\nTo find the number of red marbles, we need to determine the value of \\( B \\). Since \\( B \\) must be at least 21, we use the smallest possible value for \\( B \\), which is 21:\n\n\\[\n59 - 21 = 38\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of red marbles is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{38}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many of Fred's marbles are red, we start by calculating the minimum number of dark blue marbles. Since at least a third of Fred's marbles are dark blue, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 63 = 21\n\\]\n\nSo, Fred has at least 21 dark blue marbles. Let's denote the number of dark blue marbles by \\( d \\). Therefore, \\( d \\geq 21 \\).\n\nThe total number of marbles is 63, and the rest of the marbles are red or green. Since there are 4 green marbles, the number of red marbles can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n63 - d - 4 = 59 - d\n\\]\n\nSince \\( d \\geq 21 \\), the smallest possible value for \\( d \\) is 21. If \\( d = 21 \\), then the number of red marbles is:\n\n\\[\n59 - 21 = 38\n\\]\n\nTo ensure that this is the only possible value, we check if \\( d \\) can be greater than 21. If \\( d \\) were greater than 21, then \\( 59 - d \\) would be less than 38. However, since the number of red marbles must be a non-negative integer and we are looking for the minimum number of dark blue marbles (which is 21), the only valid solution is when \\( d = 21 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of red marbles is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{38}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many of Fred's marbles are red, we start by analyzing the information given:\n\n1. Fred has a total of 63 marbles.\n2. At least a third of the marbles are dark blue.\n3. All marbles that are not dark blue are either red or green.\n4. There are 4 green marbles.\n\nFirst, we calculate the minimum number of dark blue marbles. Since at least a third of the marbles are dark blue, we find one third of 63:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{63}{3} = 21\n\\]\n\nThus, Fred has at least 21 dark blue marbles. Let \\( x \\) represent the number of dark blue marbles. Therefore, \\( x \\geq 21 \\).\n\nNext, we determine the number of marbles that are not dark blue. Since the total number of marbles is 63, the number of non-dark blue marbles is:\n\n\\[\n63 - x\n\\]\n\nWe know that all non-dark blue marbles are either red or green. Given that there are 4 green marbles, the number of red marbles is:\n\n\\[\n(63 - x) - 4 = 59 - x\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\geq 21 \\), the smallest value for \\( x \\) is 21. Substituting \\( x = 21 \\) into the equation for the number of red marbles, we get:\n\n\\[\n59 - 21 = 38\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of red marbles is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",
        "To determine the number of red marbles Fred has, we start by analyzing the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Total number of marbles:**\n   Fred has a total of 63 marbles.\n\n2. **的能力 to dark blue marbles:**\n   At least a third of Fred's marbles are dark blue. To find the minimum number of dark blue marbles:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 63 = 21\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Fred has at least 21 dark blue marbles.\n\n3. **Number of green marbles:**\n   Fred has exactly 4 green marbles.\n\n4. **Number of marbles that are either dark blue or green:**\n   Since all marbles that are not red are either dark blue or green, we add the number of dark blue marbles (at least 21) and the number of green marbles:\n   \\[\n   21 + 4 = 25\n   \\]\n\n5. **Number of red marbles:**\n   To find the number of red marbles, we subtract the total number of dark blue and green marbles from the total number of marbles:\n   \\[\n   63 - 25 = 38\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of red marbles Fred has is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",

Let \\( x \\) be the number of dark blue marbles. Then, the number of red marbles is given by the total number of marbles minus the number of dark blue marbles and the number of green marbles:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red marbles} = 63 - x - 4 = 59 - x\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\geq 21 \\), the maximum number of red marbles occurs when \\( x = 21 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red marbles} = 59 - 21 = 38\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of red marbles is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{38}\n\\]",

Since \\( b \\geq 21 \\), the smallest possible value for \\( b \\) is 21. Substituting \\( b = 21 \\) into the equation for the number of red marbles, we get:\n\n\\[\n59 - 21 = 38\n\\]\n\nTo confirm that this is the correct answer, we check if the conditions of the problem are satisfied. If Fred has 21 dark blue marbles, 4 green marbles, and 38 red marbles, the total number of marbles is:\n\n\\[\n21 + 4 + 38 = 63\n\\]\n\nThis matches the total number of marbles given in the problem.

Since \\( x \\geq 21 \\), we can find the maximum number of dark blue marbles, which is 59 (since if \\( x \\) were any more, \\( 59 - x \\) would be negative, which is not possible). However, the minimum number of dark blue marbles is 21. To find the exact number of red marbles, we use the minimum number of dark blue marbles:\n\n\\[\nx = 21\n\\]\n\nThen the number of red marbles is:\n\n\\[\n59 - 21 = 38\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of red marbles is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",
        "To determine how many of Fred's marbles are red, we start by calculating the minimum number of dark blue marbles. Since at least a third of Fred's marbles are dark blue, we can find this number by dividing 63 by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{63}{3} = 21\n\\]\n\nSo, Fred has at least 21 dark blue marbles. Next, we need to find out how many marbles are not dark blue. Since Fred has 63 marbles in total, the number of marbles that are not dark blue is:\n\n\\[\n63 - 21 = 42\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, all of the marbles that are not dark blue are either red or green. We know that there are 4 green marbles. Therefore, the number of red marbles is:\n\n\\[\n42 - 4 = 38\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of red marbles Fred has is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{38}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many red marbles Fred has, we start by calculating the number of dark blue marbles. Since at least a third of Fred's marbles are dark blue, we can find the minimum number of dark blue marbles by calculating one third of 63:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 63 = 21\n\\]\n\nSo, Fred has at least 21 dark blue marbles. The problem does not specify that he has more than 21 dark blue marbles, so we will assume he has exactly 21 dark blue marbles for the minimum case. Next, we know that all of the rest of the marbles are either red or green, with 4 being green. Therefore, we can find the number of marbles that are not dark blue by subtracting the number of dark blue marbles from the total number of marbles:\n\n\\[\n63 - 21 = 42\n\\]\n\n Out of these 42 marbles, 4 are green, so the number of red marbles is:\n\n\\[\n42 - 4 = 38\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of red marbles Fred has is \\(\\boxed{38}\\)."
