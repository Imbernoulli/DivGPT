She wants to find out how many of each plant she has pictures of, but she has 960 pictures, and counting them all will take her a long time. Her teacher suggested she use a program on the computer that can automatically tell her what plant is in each picture and count them for her. It will take the program 2 minutes to process each picture. How many hours will it take to process all of the pictures?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Convert the total time from minutes to hours.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time required to process all the pictures in minutes. The program takes 2 minutes to process each picture, and Alex has 960 pictures. Therefore, the total time \\( T \\) in minutes is:\n\\[\nT = 960 \\text{ pictures} \\times 2 \\text{ minutes per picture} = 1920 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total time in minutes by 60:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time in hours} = \\frac{1920 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes per hour}} = 32 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take the program \\(\\boxed{32}\\) hours to process all of the pictures.",
