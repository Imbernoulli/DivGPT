Each larger bottle is 25% larger than a 16-ounce bottle. Therefore, the size of each larger bottle is:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ ounces} \\times 1.25 = 20 \\text{ ounces} \\]\nJon drinks 2 larger bottles each day, so the total amount of fluid from the larger bottles each day is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ bottles/day} \\times 20 \\text{ ounces/bottle} = 40 \\text{ ounces/day} \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of fluid Jon drinks each day by adding the fluid from the 16-ounce bottles and the larger bottles:\n\\[ 64 \\text{ ounces/day} + 40 \\text{ ounces/day} = 104 \\text{ ounces/day} \\]\n\nFinally, to find out how much fluid Jon drinks in a week, we multiply his daily fluid intake by 7:\n\\[ 104 \\text{ ounces/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 728 \\text{ ounces/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of fluid Jon drinks in a week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{728} \\]"
