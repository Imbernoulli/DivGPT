        "To determine how many dollars Saheed made, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.\n\n1. First, we find out how much money Kayla made. According to the problem, Kayla made $30 less than Vika. Since Vika made $84, we calculate Kayla's earnings as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Kayla's earnings} = \\text{Vika's earnings} - 30 = 84 - 30 = 54\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we determine how much money Saheed made. The problem states that Saheed made four times as much money as Kayla. Since Kayla made $54, we calculate Saheed's earnings as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Saheed's earnings} = 4 \\times \\text{Kayla's earnings} = 4 \\times 54 = 216\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of dollars Saheed made is \\(\\boxed{216}\\).",
