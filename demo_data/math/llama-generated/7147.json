Therefore, we calculate the number of stuffed animals Kenley has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Kenley's stuffed animals} = 2 \\times 34 = 68\n\\]\n\nNext, Tenly has 5 more stuffed animals than Kenley. Therefore, we calculate the number of stuffed animals Tenly has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Tenly's stuffed animals} = 68 + 5 = 73\n\\]\n\nNow, we add up the stuffed animals from McKenna, Kenley, and Tenly:\n\\[\n\\text{Total stuffed animals} = 34 + 68 + 73\n\\]\n\nTo make the addition easier, we can add the numbers step by step:\n\\[\n34 + 68 = 102\n\\]\n\\[\n102 + 73 = 175\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of stuffed animals the three girls have in all is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{175}\n\\]",
