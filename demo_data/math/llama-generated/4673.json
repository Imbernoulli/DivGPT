        "To determine how much more Leila spent on jewelry than on the sweater, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the total amount of money Leila had initially:**\n   Leila spent $40, which is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of her total money. Let \\( x \\) be the total amount of money she had.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4}x = 40\n   \\]\n   To find \\( x \\), multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n   \\[\n   x = 40 \\times 4 = 160\n   \\]\n   So, Leila had $160 initially.\n\n2. **Determine how much money Leila spent on jewelry:**\n   Leila spent the remaining money after buying the sweater on jewelry and was left with $20. First, calculate how much money she had after buying the sweater:\n   \\[\n   160 - 40 = 120\n   \\]\n   Since she was left with $20 after buying jewelry, the amount she spent on jewelry is:\n   \\[\n   120 - 20 = 100\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how much more Leila spent on jewelry than on the sweater:**\n   Leila spent $100 on jewelry and $40 on the sweater. The difference is:\n   \\[\n   100 - 40 = 60\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Leila spent \\(\\boxed{60}\\) dollars more on jewelry than on the sweater.",
