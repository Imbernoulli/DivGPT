        "To determine how many pictures Charles drew when he came back from work, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pictures Charles has drawn so far.\n2. Use the information about the remaining papers to find out how many pictures he has drawn in total.\n3. Subtract the number of pictures drawn on the days he has already drawn to find out how many pictures he drew when he came back from work.\n\nLet's start with the total number of papers Charles bought, which is 20. After drawing some pictures, he has 2 papers left. Therefore, the total number of pictures he has drawn is:\n\\[ 20 - 2 = 18 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Charles drew 6 pictures today and 6 pictures yesterday before going to work. Let's denote the number of pictures he drew when he came back from work as \\( x \\). The total number of pictures drawn is the sum of the pictures drawn today, yesterday before work, and yesterday after work:\n\\[ 6 + 6 + x = 18 \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ 12 + x = 18 \\]\n\\[ x = 18 - 12 \\]\n\\[ x = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the number of pictures Charles drew when he came back from work is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",

Therefore, the number of papers he has used is:\n\\[ 20 - 2 = 18 \\]\n\nSince each paper is used for one picture, the number of pictures Charles has drawn is 18.\n\nNext, we know that Charles drew 6 pictures today and 6 pictures before going to work yesterday. Let's denote the number of pictures he drew when he came back from work as \\( x \\). The total number of pictures drawn can be expressed as:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ (today)} + 6 \\text{ (before work yesterday)} + x \\text{ (after work yesterday)} = 18 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 12 + x = 18 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 18 - 12 \\]\n\\[ x = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pictures Charles drew when he came back from work is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
