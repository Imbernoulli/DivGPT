        "To determine the total number of steps Charlie makes during a running session, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of steps Charlie makes in one complete lap around the running field.\n2. Determine how many complete laps Charlie runs during a running session.\n3. Calculate the total number of steps by multiplying the number of steps per lap by the number of laps.\n\nFirst, we know that Charlie makes 5350 steps in one complete lap around the running field. Since he runs 2 1/2 times during a running session, we need to express 2 1/2 as an improper fraction. The mixed number 2 1/2 can be converted to an improper fraction as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2 \\times 2 + 1}{2} = \\frac{4 + 1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\nNext, we multiply the number of steps per lap by the number of laps:\n\\[ 5350 \\times \\frac{5}{2} = 5350 \\times 2.5 \\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication:\n\\[ 5350 \\times 2.5 = 5350 \\times \\left(2 + 0.5\\right) = 5350 \\times 2 + 5350 \\times 0.5 \\]\n\\[ 5350 \\times 2 = 10700 \\]\n\\[ 5350 \\times 0.5 = 2675 \\]\n\\[ 10700 + 2675 = 13375 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of steps Charlie was able to make is:\n\\[ \\boxed{13375} \\]",

        "To determine how many steps Charlie makes during his running session, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many steps Charlie makes in one complete lap around the running field.\n2. Calculate the total number of steps he makes in 2.5 laps.\n\nFirst, we know that Charlie makes 5350 steps in one complete lap around the running field. Since he runs 2.5 laps during his running session, we need to multiply the number of steps per lap by the number of laps he runs:\n\n\\[\n5350 \\text{ steps/lap} \\times 2.5 \\text{ laps} = 5350 \\times 2.5\n\\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication, we can break it down as follows:\n\n\\[\n5350 \\times 2.5 = 5350 \\times \\left(2 + 0.5\\right) = 5350 \\times 2 + 5350 \\times 0.5\n\\]\n\nCalculate each part separately:\n\n\\[\n5350 \\times 2 = 10700\n\\]\n\\[\n5350 \\times 0.5 = 2675\n\\]\n\nNow, add the two results together:\n\n\\[\n10700 + 2675 = 13375\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of steps Charlie makes during his running session is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{13375}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many steps Charlie makes during his running session, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance Charlie runs during his session.\n2. Determine the number of steps he makes based on the distance he runs.\n\nFirst, we know that Charlie runs around the field 2 1/2 times. Since the field is 3 kilometers long, we can calculate the total distance he runs by multiplying the length of the field by the number of times he runs around it:\n\\[ 2 \\frac{1}{2} = 2.5 \\]\n\\[ 3 \\text{ km} \\times 2.5 = 7.5 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Charlie makes 5350 steps for every 3 kilometers he runs. To find out how many steps he makes for 7.5 kilometers, we can set up a proportion:\n\\[ \\frac{5350 \\text{ steps}}{3 \\text{ km}} = \\frac{x \\text{ steps}}{7.5 \\text{ km}} \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we can cross-multiply and solve the equation:\n\\[ x = \\frac{5350 \\text{ steps} \\times 7.5 \\text{ km}}{3 \\text{ km}} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{5350 \\times 7.5}{3} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{40125}{3} \\]\n\\[ x = 13375 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of steps Charlie was able to make is \\(\\boxed{13375}\\)."
