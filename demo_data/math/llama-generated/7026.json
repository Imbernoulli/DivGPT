        "To determine the total weight of the remaining chocolate eggs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total weight of all the chocolate eggs:**\n   - Marie makes 12 chocolate eggs.\n   - Each egg weighs 10 ounces.\n   - Therefore, the total weight is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ eggs} \\times 10 \\text{ ounces per egg} = 120 \\text{ ounces}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the weight of chocolate eggs in each gift box:**\n   - Marie packs the 12 eggs equally into 4 gift boxes.\n   - So, the number of eggs per box is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{12 \\text{ eggs}}{4 \\text{ boxes}} = 3 \\text{ eggs per box}\n     \\]\n   - Each egg weighs 10 ounces, so the weight of the eggs in each box is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ eggs} \\times 10 \\text{ ounces per egg} = 30 \\text{ ounces per box}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total weight of the remaining chocolate eggs after one box is melted:**\n   - Since one box is melted and tossed out, we subtract the weight of one box from the total weight.\n   - The weight of one box is 30 ounces.\n   - Therefore, the remaining weight is:\n     \\[\n     120 \\text{ ounces} - 30 \\text{ ounces} = 90 \\text{ ounces}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total weight of the remaining chocolate eggs is \\(\\boxed{90}\\) ounces.",
