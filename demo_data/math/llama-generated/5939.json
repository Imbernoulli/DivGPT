        "To determine the total points scored by Connor, Amy, and Jason, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Connor's score.\n2. Calculate Amy's score based on Connor's score.\n3.

Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Connor's score} = 2 \\]\n\nNext, Amy scored 4 more points than Connor. So, we add 4 to Connor's score to find Amy's score:\n\\[ \\text{Amy's score} = \\text{Connor's score} + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6 \\]\n\nThen, Jason scored twice the score of Amy. So, we multiply Amy's score by 2 to find Jason's score:\n\\[ \\text{Jason's score} = 2 \\times \\text{Amy's score} = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the scores of Connor, Amy, and Jason to find the total points scored by their team:\n\\[ \\text{Total points} = \\text{Connor's score} + \\text{Amy's score} + \\text{Jason's score} = 2 + 6 + 12 = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the total points scored by their team is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",

        "To determine the total points scored by Connor, Amy, and Jason, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. ** find Amy's score:**\n   - Connor scored 2 points.\n   - Amy scored 4 more points than Connor.\n   - Therefore, Amy's score is:\n     \\[\n     2 + 4 = 6\n     \\]\n\n2. ** find Jason's score:**\n   - Jason scored twice the score of Amy.\n   - Therefore, Jason's score is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 6 = 12\n     \\]\n\n3. ** calculate the total score of the team:**\n   - Add the scores of Connor, Amy, and Jason.\n   - Therefore, the total score is:\n     \\[\n     2 + 6 + 12 = 20\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total points scored by their team is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
        "To determine the total points scored by Connor, Amy, and Jason, we start by calculating each individual's score based on the given information.\n\nFirst, we know that Connor scored 2 points. Therefore, Connor's score is:\n\\[ \\text{Connor's score} = 2 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that Amy scored 4 more points than Connor. So, Amy's score is:\n\\[ \\text{Amy's score} = \\text{Connor's score} + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6 \\]\n\nThen, we are 使用 the fact that Jason scored twice the score of Amy. So, Jason's score is:\n\\[ \\text{Jason's score} = 2 \\times \\text{Amy's score} = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\]\n\nNow, to find the total points scored by the team, we add up the scores of Connor, Amy, and Jason:\n\\[ \\text{Total points} = \\text{Connor's score} + \\text{Amy's score} + \\text{Jason's score} = 2 + 6 + 12 = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total points scored by their team is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
