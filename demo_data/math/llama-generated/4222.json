        "Let's define the initial number of marbles each person has. Let \\( S \\) be the number of marbles Steve has. Then Sam has \\( 2S \\) marbles and Sally has \\( 2S - 5 \\) marbles. According to the problem, after Sam gives 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, Sam has 8 marbles left. We can express this situation with the following equation:\n\n\\[ 2S - 3 - 3 = 8 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 2S - 6 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( S \\) by adding 6 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2S = 14 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ S = 7 \\]\n\nSo, Steve initially has 7 marbles.

Sam has twice as many marbles as Steve: \\( S = 2V \\).\n2. Sally has 5 less than Sam: \\( A = S - 5 \\).\n3. After Sam gives 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, Sam has 8 marbles left: \\( S - 3 - 3 = 8 \\).\n\nFirst, solve the equation for Sam's initial number of marbles:\n\\[ S - 6 = 8 \\]\n\\[ S = 8 + 6 \\]\n\\[ S = 14 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( S = 14 \\) into the equation for Steve's initial number of marbles:\n\\[ S = 2V \\]\n\\[ 14 = 2V \\]\n\\[ V = \\frac{14}{2} \\]\n\\[ V = 7 \\]\n\nNext, substitute \\( S = 14 \\) into the equation for Sally's initial number of marbles:\n\\[ A = S - 5 \\]\n\\[ A = 14 - 5 \\]\n\\[ A = 9 \\]\n\nAfter Sam gives 3 marbles each to Sally and Steve, we need to find out how many marbles Steve has now:\n\\[ V_{\\text{new}} = V + 3 \\]\n\\[ V_{\\text{new}} = 7 + 3 \\]\n\\[ V_{\\text{new}} = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles Steve has now is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "Let's define the initial number of marbles each person has. Let \\( S \\) be the number of marbles Steve has initially. Then Sam has \\( 2S \\) marbles and Sally has \\( 2S - 5 \\) marbles.\n\nAfter Sam gives 3 marbles to both Sally and Steve, Sam's new number of marbles is:\n\\[ 2S - 3 - 3 = 2S - 6 \\]\n\nWe know that after giving away the marbles, Sam has 8 marbles left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 2S - 6 = 8 \\]\n\nTo find \\( S \\), we solve the equation step by step:\n\\[ 2S - 6 = 8 \\]\n\\[ 2S = 8 + 6 \\]\n\\[ 2S = 14 \\]\n\\[ S = \\frac{14}{2} \\]\n\\[ S = 7 \\]\n\nSo, Steve initially has 7 marbles. After Sam gives Steve 3 marbles, Steve's new number of marbles is:\n\\[ 7 + 3 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles Steve has now is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."
