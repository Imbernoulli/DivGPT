Determine the total time required to read all the words.\n3. Calculate the average time per day.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of words Jenny needs to read. The first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words. So, the total number of words is:\n\\[ 200 + 400 + 300 = 900 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total time required to read all the words. Jenny reads 100 words per hour. Therefore, the total time required to read 900 words is:\n\\[ \\frac{900 \\text{ words}}{100 \\text{ words per hour}} = 9 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the average time per day. Jenny wants to read these books in 10 days. So, the average time per day is:\n\\[ \\frac{9 \\text{ hours}}{10 \\text{ days}} = 0.9 \\text{ hours per day} \\]\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 0.9 hours per day into minutes:\n\\[ 0.9 \\text{ hours per day} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 54 \\text{ minutes per day} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jenny should spend, on average, \\(\\boxed{54}\\) minutes per day reading.",

Determine the total number of hours Jenny needs to read:\n   Since Jenny reads 100 words per hour, we divide the total number of words by her reading speed:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{900 \\text{ words}}{100 \\text{ words per hour}} = 9 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. Convert the total hours into minutes:\n   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total number of hours by 60:\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 540 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. Divide the total minutes by the number of days to find the average minutes per day:\n   Jenny wants to read the books in 10 days, so we divide the total number of minutes by 10:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{540 \\text{ minutes}}{10 \\text{ days}} = 54 \\text{ minutes per day}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jenny should spend, on average, \\(\\boxed{54}\\) minutes per day reading.",

Since she has 10 days to read the books, we divide the total time by the number of days:\n\\[\n9 \\text{ hours} \\div 10 \\text{ days} = 0.9 \\text{ hours per day}\n\\]\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert hours per day to minutes per day:\n\\[\n0.9 \\text{ hours per day} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 54 \\text{ minutes per day}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of minutes per day Jenny should spend reading is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",

Calculate the average number of minutes per day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of words Jenny needs to read. The first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words. Therefore, the total number of words is:\n\\[ 200 + 400 + 300 = 900 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of hours Jenny needs to read. Since she reads 100 words per hour, the total reading time in hours is:\n\\[ \\frac{900 \\text{ words}}{100 \\text{ words per hour}} = 9 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we convert the total reading time into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total reading time in minutes is:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 540 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the average number of minutes per day.
