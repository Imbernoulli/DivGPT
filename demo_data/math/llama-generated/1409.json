        "Let's denote the original price Liz paid for her old car as \\( x \\). According to the problem, Liz sold her car at 80% of its original price, so the proceed from the sale is \\( 0.8x \\).\n\nLiz uses the proceeds from the sale to buy a new car that costs $30,000, and she needs an additional $4,000 to complete the purchase. This means that the proceed from the sale is $26,000 less than the cost of the new car. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 0.8x = 30000 - 4000 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 0.8x = 26000 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.8:\n\\[ x = \\frac{26000}{0.8} = 32500 \\]\n\nSo, Liz originally paid $32,500 for her old car. The cost of the new car is $30,000, so the difference in price between the old car and the new car is:\n\\[ 32500 - 30000 = 2500 \\]\n\nTherefore, the new car is \\(\\boxed{2500}\\) dollars cheaper than what Liz originally paid for her old one.",

This means that the amount she has from the sale is:\n\\[\n30,000 - 4,000 = 26,000\n\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\\[\n0.8P = 26,000\n\\]\n\nTo find the original price \\( P \\), we solve for \\( P \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.8:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{26,000}{0.8} = 32,500\n\\]\n\nThe original price Liz paid for her old car is $32,500.

        "To determine how much cheaper Liz's new car is compared to what she originally paid for her old one, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the proceeds from the sale of the old car:**\n   Liz sold her car at 80% of what she originally paid. Let \\( x \\) be the original price of the old car.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Proceeds from the sale} = 0.80x\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up an equation to find the original price of the old car:**\n   Liz uses the proceeds from the sale and needs an additional $4,000 to buy a new car that costs $30,000.
