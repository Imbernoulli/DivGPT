        "Let's start with the initial population of the city, which is 300,000. First, we add the immigrants to the population:\n\n\\[ 300,000 + 50,000 = 350,000 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of people who leave:\n\n\\[ 350,000 - 30,000 = 320,000 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many people get pregnant. According to the problem, \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of the population gets pregnant:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{8} \\times 320,000 = 40,000 \\]\n\n Out of these 40,000 people who get pregnant, \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) have twins. Therefore, the number of people who have twins is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40,000 = 10,000 \\]\n\nThe remaining people who get pregnant have single births. The number of people who have single births is:\n\n\\[ 40,000 - 10,000 = 30,000 \\]\n\nEach person who has twins gives birth to 2 children, and each person who has a single birth gives birth to 1 child. Therefore, the total number of children born is:\n\n\\[ 10,000 \\times 2 + 30,000 \\times 1 = 20,000 + 30,000 = 50,000 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of children born to the current population to find the new population:\n\n\\[ 320,000 + 50,000 = 370,000 \\]\n\nThus, the population after the births is \\(\\boxed{370000}\\).",
