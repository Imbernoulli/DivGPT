        "To determine how many pounds over the minimum Baxter purchased, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost per pound of peanuts and the minimum purchase requirement.\n2. Calculate the total number of pounds Baxter purchased.\n3. Subtract the minimum purchase requirement from the total number of pounds purchased to find out how many pounds over the minimum Baxter bought.\n\nFirst, we know that the cost per pound of peanuts is $3 and the minimum purchase requirement is 15 pounds. Baxter spent $105 on peanuts. We can find the total number of pounds Baxter purchased by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per pound:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total pounds purchased} = \\frac{\\text{Total amount spent}}{\\text{Cost per pound}} = \\frac{105}{3} = 35\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the minimum purchase requirement from the total number of pounds purchased to find out how many pounds over the minimum Baxter bought:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Pounds over the minimum} = \\text{Total pounds purchased} - \\text{Minimum purchase requirement} = 35 - 15 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pounds over the minimum that Baxter purchased is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

To find out how many pounds of peanuts Baxter purchased, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per pound:\n\\[\n\\text{Total pounds purchased} = \\frac{105}{3} = 35 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the minimum purchase requirement from the total number of pounds purchased to find out how many pounds over the minimum Baxter bought:\n\\[\n\\text{Pounds over the minimum} = 35 - 15 = 20 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pounds over the minimum that Baxter purchased is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

To find out how many pounds of peanuts Baxter purchased, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per pound:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total pounds purchased} = \\frac{\\text{Total amount spent}}{\\text{Cost per pound}} = \\frac{105}{3} = 35 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the minimum purchase requirement from the total number of pounds purchased to find out how many pounds over the minimum Baxter bought:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Pounds over the minimum} = \\text{Total pounds purchased} - \\text{Minimum purchase requirement} = 35 - 15 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pounds over the minimum that Baxter purchased is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
