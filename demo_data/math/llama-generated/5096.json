        "To determine how many egg cartons Avery can fill, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by all the chickens.\n2. Determine how many egg cartons can be filled with the total number of eggs.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of eggs laid by the chickens. Avery has 20 chickens, and each chicken lays 6 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ chickens} \\times 6 \\text{ eggs per chicken} = 120 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many egg cartons can be filled with 120 eggs. Since each egg carton can hold 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each carton can hold:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ eggs} \\div 12 \\text{ eggs per carton} = 10 \\text{ cartons} \\]\n\nThus, the number of egg cartons Avery can fill is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."
