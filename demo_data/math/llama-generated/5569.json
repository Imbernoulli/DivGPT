        "To determine the total number of marbles Courtney has, we need to calculate the number of marbles in each jar and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First Jar:**\n   - The first jar contains 80 marbles.\n\n2. **Second Jar:**\n   - The second jar has twice the amount of marbles as the first jar.\n   - Therefore, the number of marbles in the second jar is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 80 = 160\n     \\]\n\n3. **Third Jar:**\n   - The third jar has \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) the amount of marbles as the first jar.\n   - Therefore, the number of marbles in the third jar is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4} \\times 80 = 20\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total Number of Marbles:**\n   - To find the total number of marbles, we add the marbles from all three jars:\n     \\[\n     80 + 160 + 20 = 260\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of marbles Courtney has is \\(\\boxed{260}\\).",
