        "To determine how much Zilla deposits into her savings account in a month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Zilla's total monthly earnings:**\n   Zilla spends 7% of her monthly earnings on rent. We know she spent $133 on rent. Let \\( E \\) be her total monthly earnings. Then:\n   \\[\n   0.07E = 133\n   \\]\n   To find \\( E \\), divide both sides by 0.07:\n   \\[\n   E = \\frac{133}{0.07} = 1900\n   \\]\n   So, Zilla's total monthly earnings are $1900.\n\n2. **Calculate the amount spent on other monthly expenses:**\n   Zilla spends half of her monthly earnings on other monthly expenses. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Other monthly expenses} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1900 = 950\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the amount deposited into savings:**\n   The rest of Zilla's earnings go into her savings. This can be found by subtracting the rent and other monthly expenses from her total earnings:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Savings} = E - \\text{Rent} - \\text{Other monthly expenses}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Savings} = 1900 - 133 - 950 = 817\n   \\]\n\nThus, Zilla deposits \\(\\boxed{817}\\) dollars into her savings account in a month.",
