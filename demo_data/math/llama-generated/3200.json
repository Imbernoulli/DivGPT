The total number of unique players who played in the game is the number of players who started the game plus the number of substitutions made in both halves. This is \\(11 + 2 + 4 = 17\\).\n5. The number of players on the team who did not play that day is the total number of players on the team minus the total number of unique players who played in the game. This is \\(24 - 17 = 7\\).\n\nThus, the number of players on the team who did not play that day is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
        "To determine how many players on the team did not play that day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of substitutions made:**\n   - In the first half, the team made 2 substitutions.\n   - In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half. Therefore, the number of substitutions in the second half is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 2 = 4\n     \\]\n   - The total number of substitutions made throughout the game is:\n     \\[\n     2 + 4 = 6\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of players who played at least once:**\n   - 11 players started the game.\n   - Each substitution brings in a new player who was not previously playing.\n   - Therefore, the total number of unique players who played at least once is:\n     \\[\n     11 + 6 = 17\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of players who did not play:**\n   - The team originally had 24 players.\n   - The number of players who did not play is:\n     \\[\n     24 - 17 = 7\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of players on the team who did not play that day is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
        "To determine how many players on the team did not play that day, we need to calculate the total number of players who participated in the game and then subtract that from the total number of players on the team.\n\n1. **Identify the number of players who started the game:**\n   The team started with 11 players.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of substitutions made in the first half:**\n   The team made 2 substitutions in the first half.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of substitutions made in the second half:**\n   The team made twice as many substitutions in the second half as it did in the first half. Therefore, the number of substitutions in the second half is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the total number of substitutions made during the game:**\n   The total number of substitutions is the sum of the substitutions made in the first half and the second half:\n   \\[\n   2 + 4 = 6\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of unique players who played in the game:**\n   The total number of unique players is the sum of the players who started the game and the total number of substitutions:\n   \\[\n   11 + 6 = 17\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the number of players who did not play:**\n   The number of players who did not play is the total number of players on the team minus the total number of unique players who played:\n   \\[\n   24 - 17 = 7\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of players on the team who did not play that day is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
        "To determine how many players on the soccer team did not play that day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of substitutions made during the game.\n2.

Therefore, the number of substitutions in the second half is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\]\n\nThe total number of substitutions made during the game is:\n\\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of unique players who played in the game.**\n\nIn the first half, 11 players started the game, and 2 substitutions were made. This means that 2 additional players were added to the starting line-up in the first half. So, the total number of unique players who played in the first half is:\n\\[ 11 + 2 = 13 \\]\n\nIn the second half, no new players were added, and the same 6 players who played in the first half (including the 2 starters who were substituted out) remain. Therefore, the total number of unique players who played in the second half is the same as the total number of unique players who played in the first half, which is 13.\n\nThus, the total number of unique players who played in the game is:\n\\[ 13 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of unique players who played from the total number of players on the team.**\n\nThe total number of players on the team is 24.

Subtract the total number of players who played from the total number of players on the team.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The number of players who started the game is 11.\n2. The number of substitutions made in the first half is 2.\n3. The number of substitutions made in the second half is twice as many as it made in the first half. Therefore, the number of substitutions made in the second half is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n4. The total number of players who played in the game is the number of players who started plus the number of substitutions made in both halves. This is \\(11 + 2 + 4 = 17\\).\n5. The number of players who did not play that day is the total number of players on the team minus the total number of players who played.

Calculate the total number of unique players who played in the game.\n5. Subtract the total number of unique players from the total number of players on the team.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The number of players who started the game is 11.\n\n2. The team made 2 substitutions in the first half.\n\n3. The team made twice as many substitutions in the second half as it made in the first half. Therefore, the number of substitutions in the second half is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. The total number of unique players who played in the game is the sum of the players who started the game and the substitutions made in both halves. Since each substitution brings in a new player, the total number of unique players is:\n   \\[\n   11 + 2 + 4 = 17\n   \\]\n\n5. The total number of players on the team is 24.

Identify the number of players who started the game and the number of substitutions made in each half.\n2. Calculate the total number of unique players who played in the game.\n3. Subtract the total number of unique players from the total number of players on the team.\n\nFirst, let's identify the number of players who started the game and the number of substitutions made in each half:\n- The team started with 11 players.\n- In the first half, they made 2 substitutions.\n- In the second half, they made twice as many substitutions as in the first half, which is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) substitutions.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of unique players who played in the game:\n- The 11 players who started the game.\n- The 2 players who substituted in the first half.\n- The 4 players who substituted in the second half.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that we are not counting any player more than once. The substitutions in the second half could include some of the players who substituted in the first half. Since the problem does not specify that any of the players who substituted in the first half also substituted in the second half, we will assume they are different players.\n\nThus, the total number of unique players who played in the game is:\n\\[ 11 + 2 + 4 = 17 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of unique players from the total number of players on the team to find out how many players did not play that day:\n\\[ 24 - 17 = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of players on the team who did not play that day is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",

        "To determine how many players on the soccer team did not play that day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of players who started the game.\n2. Determine the number of players who were substituted in the first half.\n3. Determine the number of players who were substituted in the second half.\n4. Calculate the total number of unique players who played in the game.\n5. Subtract the total number of unique players from the total number of players on the team to find out how many did not play.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- The team had 24 players prepared for the game.\n- 11 players started the game.\n- 2 substitutions were made in the first half.\n- The team made twice as many substitutions in the second half as it made in the first half.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of substitutions made in the second half:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\]\n\nNext, determine the total number of unique players who played in the game. The players who played are the 11 players who started plus the 2 players substituted in the first half and the 4 players substituted in the second half. However, we need to be careful not to count any player more than once. The 2 players substituted in the first half and the 4 players substituted in the second half could include some players who were already substituted out and then substituted back in.\n\nTo clarify, let's break it down:\n- 11 players started.\n- 2 players were substituted in the first half.\n- 4 players were substituted in the second half.\n\nIf we assume the worst-case scenario where there is no overlap between the players substituted in the first half and the players substituted in the second half (which would give us the maximum number of unique players), then the total number of unique players is:\n\\[ 11 + 2 + 4 = 17 \\]\n\nNow, subtract the total number of unique players from the total number of players on the team to find out how many did not play:\n\\[ 24 - 17 = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of players on the team who did not play that day is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
