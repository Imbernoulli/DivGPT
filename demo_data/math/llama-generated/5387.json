Since each large pizza has 8 slices and Mary orders 2 large pizzas, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ pizzas} \\times 8 \\text{ slices per pizza} = 16 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of slices Mary eats from the total number of slices. Mary eats 7 slices, so we subtract 7 from 16:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ slices} - 7 \\text{ slices} = 9 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of slices that will remain is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
