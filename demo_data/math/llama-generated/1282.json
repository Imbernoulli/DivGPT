        "To determine how much the smaller house is being expanded by, we start by defining the original square footage of the houses and the new total square footage. Let's denote the expansion in square footage by the smaller house as \\( x \\).\n\nThe original square footage of the smaller house is 5,200 square feet. After the expansion, the square footage of the smaller house will be \\( 5,200 + x \\). The square footage of the larger house remains unchanged at 7,300 square feet.\n\nAccording to the problem, the new total square footage of both houses combined is 16,000 square feet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n(5,200 + x) + 7,300 = 16,000\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n12,500 + x = 16,000\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we subtract 12,500 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = 16,000 - 12,500\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\n\\[\nx = 3,500\n\\]\n\nThus, the smaller house is being expanded by \\(\\boxed{3500}\\) square feet.",

Determine the new total square footage of both houses.\n3. Calculate the increase in square footage for the smaller house.\n\nFirst, let's denote the original square footage of the smaller house as \\( A \\) and the original square footage of the larger house as \\( B \\).
