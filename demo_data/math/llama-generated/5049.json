        "To determine how much the reporter can expect to earn per hour, we need to calculate her total earnings for the 4-hour period and then divide by 4.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of words she can write in 4 hours. Since she writes at a rate of 10 words per minute and there are 60 minutes in an hour, she writes:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ words/minute} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 600 \\text{ words/hour} \\]\nFor 4 hours, she writes:\n\\[ 600 \\text{ words/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 2400 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate her earnings from the words she writes. Since she earns $0.1 per word, her earnings from the words are:\n\\[ 2400 \\text{ words} \\times 0.1 \\text{ dollars/word} = 240 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n She also earns $60 per article and she has to finish 3 articles. Therefore, her earnings from the articles are:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ articles} \\times 60 \\text{ dollars/article} = 180 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding her earnings from the words and the articles gives her total earnings for the 4 hours:\n\\[ 240 \\text{ dollars} + 180 \\text{ dollars} = 420 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTo find out how much she can expect to earn per hour, we divide her total earnings by 4:\n\\[ 420 \\text{ dollars} \\div 4 \\text{ hours} = 105 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\]\n\nThus, the reporter can expect to earn \\(\\boxed{105}\\) dollars per hour.",
        "To determine how much the reporter can expect to earn per hour, we need to break down her earnings into two components: earnings from words and earnings from articles.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of words the reporter can write in 4 hours.

Determine the earnings from the words written.\n3. Determine the earnings from the articles.\n4. Calculate the total earnings in 4 hours.\n5. Divide the total earnings by 4 to find the hourly earnings.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of words the reporter will write in 4 hours.\n   - The reporter writes at a rate of 10 words per minute.\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - Therefore, the reporter writes \\(10 \\text{ words/minute} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 600 \\text{ words/hour}\\).\n   - Since she writes for 4 hours, the total number of words is \\(600 \\text{ words/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 2400 \\text{ words}\\).\n\n2. Determine the earnings from the words written.\n   - The reporter earns $0.1 per word.\n   - Therefore, the earnings from the words are \\(2400 \\text{ words} \\times 0.1 \\text{ dollars/word} = 240 \\text{ dollars}\\).\n\n3. Determine the earnings from the articles.\n   - The reporter earns $60 per article.\n   - Since she completes 3 articles, the earnings from the articles are \\(3 \\text{ articles} \\times 60 \\text{ dollars/article} = 180 \\text{ dollars}\\).\n\n4. Calculate the total earnings in 4 hours.\n   - The total earnings are the sum of the earnings from the words and the earnings from the articles.\n   - Therefore, the total earnings are \\(240 \\text{ dollars} + 180 \\text{ dollars} = 420 \\text{ dollars}\\).\n\n5. Divide the total earnings by 4 to find the hourly earnings.\n   - The hourly earnings are \\(\\frac{420 \\text{ dollars}}{4 \\text{ hours}} = 105 \\text{ dollars/hour}\\).\n\nThus, the reporter can expect to earn \\(\\boxed{105}\\) dollars per hour.",
        "To determine how much the reporter can expect to earn per hour, we need to calculate her total earnings for the 4-hour period and then divide that by 4.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of words she writes in 4 hours.

Therefore, in one hour she writes:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ words/minute} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 600 \\text{ words/hour} \\]\n\nSince she has to finish three stories in 4 hours, the total number of words she writes in 4 hours is:\n\\[ 600 \\text{ words/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 2400 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate her earnings from the words she writes. She earns $0.1 per word, so her earnings from the words are:\n\\[ 2400 \\text{ words} \\times 0.1 \\text{ dollars/word} = 240 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nIn addition to her earnings from the words, she earns $60 per article.
