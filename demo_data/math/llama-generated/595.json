Since she is at the beach for 16 hours, we divide 16 by 2:\n\\[ \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\]\nSo, Tiffany needs to re-apply sunscreen 8 times.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total amount of sunscreen needed.**\n\nEach application requires 3 ounces of sunscreen. Since she needs to re-apply 8 times, we multiply 8 by 3:\n\\[ 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\]\nSo, Tiffany needs 24 ounces of sunscreen.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of bottles of sunscreen required.**\n\nEach bottle contains 12 ounces of sunscreen. To find out how many bottles are needed, we divide 24 by 12:\n\\[ \\frac{24}{12} = 2 \\]\nSo, Tiffany needs 2 bottles of sunscreen.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the total cost of the sunscreen.**\n\nEach bottle costs $3.5.
