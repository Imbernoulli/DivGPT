        "To determine how many marbles James has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of marbles per bag:**\n   James has 28 marbles and he puts them into 4 bags. To find out how many marbles are in each bag, we divide the total number of marbles by the number of bags:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{28}{4} = 7\n   \\]\n   So, each bag contains 7 marbles.\n\n2. **Determine the total number of marbles given away:**\n   James gives away one bag. Since each bag contains 7 marbles, the number of marbles given away is:\n   \\[\n   7\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of marbles left:**\n   To find out how many marbles James has left, we subtract the number of marbles given away from the total number of marbles he originally had:\n   \\[\n   28 - 7 = 21\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles James has left is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",

        "To determine how many marbles James has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of marbles in each bag.\n2. Determine the total number of marbles after giving one bag away.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of marbles in each bag. James has 28 marbles and he puts them into 4 bags, with the same number of marbles in each bag. So, we divide the total number of marbles by the number of bags:\n\\[\n28 \\div 4 = 7\n\\]\nThis means each bag contains 7 marbles.\n\nNext, we determine the total number of marbles after giving one bag away. Since each bag contains 7 marbles and he gives one bag away, he gives away 7 marbles. Therefore, we subtract the number of marbles in one bag from the total number of marbles:\n\\[\n28 - 7 = 21\n\\]\nSo, the number of marbles James has left is \\boxed{21}.",
