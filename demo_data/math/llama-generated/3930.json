        "To determine the total length of Tim's trip, we need to consider both the time he spent driving and the time he spent stuck in traffic. We know from the problem that Tim was stuck in traffic for twice as long as he was driving.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Tim spent stuck in traffic:\n\\[\n\\text{Time stuck in traffic} = 2 \\times \\text{Time driving}\n\\]\nGiven that Tim drove for 5 hours, we substitute this value into the equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Time stuck in traffic} = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the time spent driving to the time stuck in traffic to find the total length of the trip:\n\\[\n\\text{Total trip time} = \\text{Time driving} + \\text{Time stuck in traffic}\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n\\text{Total trip time} = 5 + 10 = 15 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total length of the trip is \\boxed{15} hours.",

Calculate the total duration of the trip.\n   - The total duration is the sum of the time spent driving and the time spent stuck in traffic.\n   - So, the total duration is \\(5 + 10 = 15\\) hours.\n\nThus, the total duration of the trip is \\(\\boxed{15}\\) hours.",
        "To determine the total duration of Tim's trip, we need to consider both the time he spent driving and the time he was stuck in traffic.
