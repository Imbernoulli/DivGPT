Calculate the number of double-flips Tyler did.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of flips Jen did. Jen did sixteen triple-flips. Since each triple-flip consists of three flips, we multiply the number of triple-flips by 3:\n\\[\n16 \\times 3 = 48\n\\]\nSo, Jen did 48 flips in total.\n\nNext, we know that Tyler flipped in the air half the number of times Jen did. Therefore, we divide the total number of flips Jen did by 2:\n\\[\n48 \\div 2 = 24\n\\]\nSo, Tyler did 24 flips in total.\n\nSince each double-flip consists of two flips, we divide the total number of flips Tyler did by 2 to find out how many double-flips he did:\n\\[\n24 \\div 2 = 12\n\\]\nSo, Tyler did 12 double-flips.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
