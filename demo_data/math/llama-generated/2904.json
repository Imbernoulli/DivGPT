This means Han visited:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3 - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, Han visited 4 rehabilitation centers.\n\n3. **Determine how many rehabilitation centers Jane visited:**\n   Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han. This means Jane visited:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4 + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14\n   \\]\n   So, Jane visited 14 rehabilitation centers.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of rehabilitation centers visited by all four:**\n   Adding up the visits of Jane, Han, Jude, and Lisa, we get:\n   \\[\n   14 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 27\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of rehabilitation centers they all visited is \\(\\boxed{27}\\).",
        "Let's start by determining how many rehabilitation centers each person visited based on the information given.\n\nFirst, we know that Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers.

This means Jude visited half of Lisa's visits:\n\\[ J = \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude.
