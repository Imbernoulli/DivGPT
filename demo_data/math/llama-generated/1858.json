        "To determine how much Greg and Earl will have together after all debts are paid, we need to account for the organization andlit of money between Earl, Fred, and Greg.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the net amount each person will have after all debts are satisfied:\n\n1. **Earl**:\n   - Earl starts with $90.\n   - Earl owes Fred $28.\n   - Greg owes Earl $40.\n   - Net amount for Earl: \\( 90 - 28 + 40 = 102 \\)\n\n2. **Fred**:\n   - Fred starts with $48.\n   - Earl owes Fred $28.\n   - Fred owes Greg $32.\n   - Net amount for Fred: \\( 48 + 28 - 32 = 44 \\)\n\n3. **Greg**:\n   - Greg starts with $36.\n   - Fred owes Greg $32.\n   - Greg owes Earl $40.\n   - Net amount for Greg: \\( 36 + 32 - 40 = 28 \\)\n\nNow, we add the net amounts of Greg and Earl to find out how much they have together:\n\n\\[\n102 + 28 = 130\n\\]\n\nThus, after all debts are paid, Greg and Earl will have together \\(\\boxed{130}\\) dollars.",
        "Let's start by calculating how much each person will have after all debts are paid.\n\nFirst, let's consider Earl. Earl initially has $90 and owes Fred $28. So, Earl's net amount after paying off his debt to Fred will be:\n\\[90 - 28 = 62\\]\nHowever, Earl will also receive $40 from Greg. So, Earl's final amount will be:\n\\[62 + 40 = 102\\]\n\nNext, let's consider Fred. Fred initially has $48 and owes Greg $32. So, Fred's net amount after paying off his debt to Greg will be:\n\\[48 - 32 = 16\\]\nHowever, Fred will also receive $28 from Earl. So, Fred's final amount will be:\n\\[16 + 28 = 44\\]\n\nFinally, let's consider Greg. Greg initially has $36 and owes Earl $40. So, Greg's net amount after paying off his debt to Earl will be:\n\\[36 - 40 = -4\\]\nHowever, Greg will also receive $32 from Fred. So, Greg's final amount will be:\n\\[-4 + 32 = 28\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much Greg and Earl will have together after all debts are paid. Adding Greg's final amount and Earl's final amount, we get:\n\\[102 + 28 = 130\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount that Greg and Earl will have together is:\n\\[\\boxed{130}\\]",

Greg initially has $36 and owes Earl $40, so we subtract $40 from $36:\n\\[ 36 - 40 = -4 \\]\nGreg will receive $32 from Fred, so we add $32 to $-4:\n\\[ -4 + 32 = 28 \\]\nTherefore, after all debts are paid, Greg will have $28.\n\nTo find out how much Greg and Earl will have together, we add Greg's and Earl's final amounts:\n\\[ 102 + 28 = 130 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Greg and Earl will have together is \\(\\boxed{130}\\)."
