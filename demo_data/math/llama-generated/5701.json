        "To determine how much more money Juanita spends buying the newspaper yearly than Grant, we need to calculate both Juanita's and Grant's annual costs and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Juanita's annual cost. Juanita buys the newspaper daily, and her costs vary depending on the day of the week.\n\n- For Monday through Saturday, she spends $0.50 each day.\n- For Sunday, she spends $2.00.\n\nThere are 52 weeks in a year, so:\n- The number of days from Monday to Saturday in a week is 6.\n- The number of Sundays in a week is 1.\n\nNext, we calculate her weekly cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost from Monday to Saturday} = 6 \\times 0.50 = 3.00\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Cost on Sunday} = 2.00\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total weekly cost} = 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate her annual cost by multiplying her weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year:\n\\[\n\\text{Annual cost} = 5.00 \\times 52 = 260.00\n\\]\n\nGrant spends $200.00 a year on the newspaper delivery.\n\nTo find out how much more Juanita spends than Grant, we subtract Grant's annual cost from Juanita's annual cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 260.00 - 200.00 = 60.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Juanita spends \\(\\boxed{60.00}\\) dollars more on the newspaper yearly than Grant.",
