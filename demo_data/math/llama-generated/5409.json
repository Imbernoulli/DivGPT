        "To determine the number of kids who came to the cookout in 2004, we need to work backwards from the information given about the number of kids in 2006.\n\nFirst, we know that there were 20 kids at the cookout in 2006. According to the problem, the number of kids in 2006 was \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the number of kids in 2005. Let's denote the number of kids in 2005 as \\(x\\).
