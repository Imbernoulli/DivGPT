Since half of the shirts were white:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of white t-shirts} = \\frac{200}{2} = 100\n\\]\n\nNow, we determine the total revenue from the black t-shirts. Each black t-shirt costs $30:\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from black t-shirts} = 100 \\times 30 = 3000\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the total revenue from the white t-shirts. Each white t-shirt costs $25:\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from white t-shirts} = 100 \\times 25 = 2500\n\\]\n\nThen, we find the total revenue from all the t-shirts by adding the revenue from the black t-shirts and the revenue from the white t-shirts:\n\\[\n\\text{Total revenue} = 3000 + 2500 = 5500\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the revenue per minute by dividing the total revenue by the total time in minutes:\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue per minute} = \\frac{5500}{25} = 220\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money they made per minute during the sale is \\boxed{220}.",

Since the other half of the 200 t-shirts were white, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of white t-shirts} = \\frac{200}{2} = 100\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total revenue from the black t-shirts. Each black t-shirt costs $30, so the total revenue from the black t-shirts is:\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from black t-shirts} = 100 \\times 30 = 3000\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue from the white t-shirts. Each white t-shirt costs $25, so the total revenue from the white t-shirts is:\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from white t-shirts} = 100 \\times 25 = 2500\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total revenue from all the t-shirts by adding the revenue from the black t-shirts and the revenue from the white t-shirts:\n\\[\n\\text{Total revenue} = 3000 + 2500 = 5500\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the revenue per minute by dividing the total revenue by the total time (25 minutes):\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue per minute} = \\frac{5500}{25} = 220\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money they made per minute during the sale is \\boxed{220}.",
