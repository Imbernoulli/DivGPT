        "To determine the total number of dolls in Lucy's collection after receiving the two new dolls, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) represent the original number of dolls in Lucy's collection.\n2. According to the problem, adding two new dolls increased the collection by 25%. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n   \\[\n   2 = 0.25x\n   \\]\n3. To find \\( x \\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 0.25:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{2}{0.25}\n   \\]\n4.
