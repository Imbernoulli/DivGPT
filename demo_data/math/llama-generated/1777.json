        "To determine how many times more money Carlos would get from melting down the gold quarters instead of spending them in a store, we need to compare the value of the quarters in both scenarios.\n\nFirst, let's find the value of one quarter when spent in a store. Each quarter is worth $0.25.\n\nNext, let's find the value of one quarter when melted down. Each quarter weighs \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of an ounce, and the value of gold is $100 per ounce. Therefore, the value of one quarter when melted down is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\text{ ounce} \\times 100 \\text{ dollars/ounce} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the ratio of the value of one quarter when melted down to the value of one quarter when spent in a store:\n\\[\n\\frac{20 \\text{ dollars}}{0.25 \\text{ dollars}} = 80\n\\]\n\nThis means Carlos would get 80 times more money from melting down the gold quarters instead of spending them in a store.
