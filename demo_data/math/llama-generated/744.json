        "To determine how many caterpillars are left on the tree, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of caterpillars on the tree.\n2. Add the number of baby caterpillars that hatch.\n3. Subtract the number of caterpillars that leave to cocoon themselves.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Initially, there are 14 caterpillars on the tree.\n2. 4 more eggs hatch, so 4 baby caterpillars climb out to munch on the leaves. Adding these to the initial number gives:\n   \\[\n   14 + 4 = 18\n   \\]\n   So, now there are 18 caterpillars on the tree.\n3. 8 caterpillars leave the tree to cocoon themselves. Subtracting these from the current number gives:\n   \\[\n   18 - 8 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, there are 10 caterpillars left on the tree.\n\nTherefore, the number of caterpillars left on the tree is \\boxed{10}.",
