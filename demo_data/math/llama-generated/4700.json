        "To determine the number of non-foreign male students at the school, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of female students.\n2. Determine the number of male students.\n3. Find out how many of the male students are foreign.\n4. Subtract the number of foreign male students from the total number of male students to get the number of non-foreign male students.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The school has 300 students and 2/3 of them are females. So, the number of female students is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 300 = 200\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the number of male students by subtracting the number of female students from the total number of students:\n\\[\n300 - 200 = 100\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that one-tenth of the male students are foreign. So, the number of foreign male students is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10} \\times 100 = 10\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of foreign male students from the total number of male students to get the number of non-foreign male students:\n\\[\n100 - 10 = 90\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of non-foreign male students is \\boxed{90}.",
        "To determine the number of non-foreign male students at the school, we start by calculating the number of female and male students.\n\nFirst, we find the number of female students.

Determine the number of male students.\n   Since the total number of students is 300 and 200 of them are female, the number of male students is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of male students} = 300 - 200 = 100\n   \\]\n\n3. Find out how many male students are foreign.\n   One-tenth of the male students are foreign.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of foreign male students} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 100 = 10\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract the number of foreign male students from the total number of male students to get the number of non-foreign male students.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of non-foreign male students} = 100 - 10 = 90\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of non-foreign male students is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).",
