        "To find the value of the triangle base, let's start by defining the sides of the triangle. Let's denote the left side by \\( L \\), the right side by \\( R \\), and the base by \\( B \\). According to the problem, the left side \\( L \\) is 12 cm, and the right side \\( R \\) is 2 cm longer than the left side. Therefore, we can express the right side as:\n\\[ R = L + 2 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( L \\) (which is 12 cm) into the equation for \\( R \\), we get:\n\\[ R = 12 + 2 = 14 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. The problem states that the perimeter is 50 cm. Therefore, we can write the equation for the perimeter as:\n\\[ L + R + B = 50 \\]\nSubstituting the values of \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) into this equation, we get:\n\\[ 12 + 14 + B = 50 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( B \\), we need to isolate \\( B \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 26 (the sum of 12 and 14) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ B = 50 - 26 \\]\n\\[ B = 24 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the triangle base is:\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]",

Let's denote the left side of the triangle as \\( L \\), the right side as \\( R \\), and the base as \\( B \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. The sum of the three sides of the triangle is 50 cm.\n2. The right side is 2 cm longer than the left side.\n3. The left side has a value of 12 cm.\n\nFirst, we can express the right side \\( R \\) in terms of the left side \\( L \\):\n\\[ R = L + 2 \\]\n\nSince the left side \\( L \\) is given as 12 cm, we substitute \\( L = 12 \\) into the equation for \\( R \\):\n\\[ R = 12 + 2 = 14 \\]\n\nNow, we know the left side \\( L \\) is 12 cm, the right side \\( R \\) is 14 cm, and we need to find the base \\( B \\). According to the problem, the sum of the three sides is 50 cm. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ L + R + B = 50 \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values of \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 12 + 14 + B = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we combine the constants on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 26 + B = 50 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( B \\), we subtract 26 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ B = 50 - 26 \\]\n\\[ B = 24 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the triangle base is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
        "To determine the value of the triangle base, we start by identifying the lengths of all three sides of the triangle. Let's denote the left side as \\( L \\), the right side as \\( R \\), and the base as \\( B \\). According to the problem, we have the following information:\n\n1. The sum of the three sides is 50 cm.\n2. The right side is 2 cm longer than the left side.\n3. The left side is 12 cm.\n\nFrom the third piece of information, we can assign:\n\\[ L = 12 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nNext, using the second piece of information, we can express the right side in terms of the left side:\n\\[ R = L + 2 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( L \\) into this equation, we get:\n\\[ R = 12 + 2 = 14 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nNow, we use the first piece of information, which states that the sum of the three sides is 50 cm:\n\\[ L + R + B = 50 \\]\nSubstituting the values of \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) into this equation, we get:\n\\[ 12 + 14 + B = 50 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( B \\), we simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 26 + B = 50 \\]\nThen, we isolate \\( B \\) by subtracting 26 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ B = 50 - 26 \\]\n\\[ B = 24 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of the triangle base is \\(\\boxed{24}\\)."
