The rope is 100 cm long, and the longer sides of the rectangle are each 28 cm long.\n\nFirst, we calculate the combined length of the two longer sides:\n\\[\n28 \\text{ cm} + 28 \\text{ cm} = 56 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the combined length of the longer sides from the total length of the rope to find the combined length of the two shorter sides:\n\\[\n100 \\text{ cm} - 56 \\text{ cm} = 44 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nSince the two shorter sides are of equal length, we divide the combined length of the shorter sides by 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{44 \\text{ cm}}{2} = 22 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the length of each of the shorter sides is \\(\\boxed{22}\\) cm.",
        "To determine the length of each of the shorter sides of the rectangle, we start by recalling that the perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n\\]\n\nIn this problem, the perimeter of the rectangle is 100 cm, and the length of each longer side is 28 cm. Let's denote the length of each shorter side by \\( w \\).
