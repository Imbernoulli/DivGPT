        "To determine the total number of cups of coffee Ivory and Brayan drink together in 5 hours, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of coffee Brayan drinks in 5 hours.\n2. Determine how much coffee Ivory drinks in 5 hours based on the information that she drinks half as much coffee as Brayan.\n3. Add the amounts of coffee drinkers Brayan and Ivory consumed over the 5 hours.\n\nFirst, we know that Brayan drinks 4 cups of coffee per hour. Therefore, in 5 hours, Brayan drinks:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ cups/hour} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 20 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Brayan drinks twice as much coffee as Ivory. So, Ivory drinks half as much coffee as Brayan. Therefore, in 5 hours, Ivory drinks:\n\\[ \\frac{20 \\text{ cups}}{2} = 10 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNow, we add the amounts of coffee consumed by Brayan and Ivory over the 5 hours:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ cups} + 10 \\text{ cups} = 30 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cups of coffee they drink together in 5 hours is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",
