        "To determine how much time both the cougar and the zebra sleep in one week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the daily sleep time for each animal.\n2. Multiply the daily sleep time by the number of days in a week (7 days).\n\nFirst, let's find out how much time the zebra sleeps each day. The problem states that the zebra sleeps for 2 hours more than the cougar. Since the cougar sleeps for 4 hours each day, the zebra sleeps for:\n\\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \\text{ hours per day} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the weekly sleep time for the cougar. Since the cougar sleeps for 4 hours each day, in one week (7 days) the cougar sleeps:\n\\[ 4 \\times 7 = 28 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSimilarly, we calculate the weekly sleep time for the zebra. Since the zebra sleeps for 6 hours each day, in one week (7 days) the zebra sleeps:\n\\[ 6 \\times 7 = 42 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we add the weekly sleep times of the cougar and the zebra to find the total sleep time for both animals in one week:\n\\[ 28 + 42 = 70 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time both animals sleep in one week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]",

Add the weekly sleep times of both animals to get the total sleep time for both in one week.\n\nLet's start with the cougar:\n- The cougar sleeps for 4 hours each night.\n- Therefore, the cougar sleeps \\(4 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 7 \\text{ nights/week} = 28 \\text{ hours/week}\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the daily sleep time for the zebra:\n- The zebra sleeps for 2 hours more each night than the cougar.\n- Since the cougar sleeps 4 hours each night, the zebra sleeps \\(4 \\text{ hours/night} + 2 \\text{ hours/night} = 6 \\text{ hours/night}\\).\n- Therefore, the zebra sleeps \\(6 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 7 \\text{ nights/week} = 42 \\text{ hours/week}\\).\n\nNow, we add the weekly sleep times of both animals:\n- The total sleep time for both animals in one week is \\(28 \\text{ hours/week} + 42 \\text{ hours/week} = 70 \\text{ hours/week}\\).\n\nThus, the total time both animals sleep in one week is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",
