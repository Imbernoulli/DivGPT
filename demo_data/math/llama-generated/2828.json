Find the number of cows with no spot.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of cows with a red spot.**\n\nIDAD percent of the cows have a red spot. Since Mr. Maximilian has 140 cows, we can calculate the number of cows with a red spot as follows:\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 140 = 56 \\]\nSo, 56 cows have a red spot.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of cows without a red spot.**\n\nThe total number of cows is 140, and 56 of them have a red spot.

Find the number of cows with no spot.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of cows with a red spot:\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 140 = 56 \\]\nSo, 56 cows have a red spot.\n\nNext, we determine the number of cows without a red spot:\n\\[ 140 - 56 = 84 \\]\nSo, 84 cows do not have a red spot.\n\nThen, we calculate the number of cows with a blue spot. Since 25 percent of the cows without a red spot have a blue spot, we have:\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 84 = 21 \\]\nSo, 21 cows have a blue spot.\n\nFinally, we find the number of cows with no spot by subtracting the number of cows with a red spot and the number of cows with a blue spot from the total number of cows:\n\\[ 140 - 56 - 21 = 63 \\]\nSo, the number of cows with no spot is:\n\\[ \\boxed{63} \\]",
