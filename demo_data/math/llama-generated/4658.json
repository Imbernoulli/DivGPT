        "To determine the total time Jill will take to braid all the dancers' hair, we can break the problem down into smaller steps.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of braids needed for all the dancers.\n   - Each dancer has 5 braids.\n   - There are 8 dancers.\n   - Therefore, the total number of braids is \\(5 \\text{ braids/dancer} \\times 8 \\text{ dancers} = 40 \\text{ braids}\\).\n\n2.
