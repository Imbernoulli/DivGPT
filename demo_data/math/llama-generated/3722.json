        "To determine the total amount of nylon Janet needs, we first calculate the amount of nylon required for the dog collars and then for the cat collars, and finally add these two amounts together.\n\n1. Calculate the nylon needed for the dog collars:\n   - Each dog collar requires 18 inches of nylon.\n   - Janet is making 9 dog collars.\n   - Therefore, the total nylon needed for the dog collars is \\( 18 \\text{ inches/collar} \\times 9 \\text{ collars} = 162 \\text{ inches} \\).\n\n2. Calculate the nylon needed for the cat collars:\n   - Each cat collar requires 10 inches of nylon.\n   - Janet is making 3 cat collars.\n   - Therefore, the total nylon needed for the cat collars is \\( 10 \\text{ inches/collar} \\times 3 \\text{ collars} = 30 \\text{ inches} \\).\n\n3.
