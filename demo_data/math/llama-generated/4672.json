        "To determine how many words Bo needs to learn each day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of words Bo already knows.\n2. Determine the number of words Bo still needs to learn.\n3. Find out how many words Bo needs to learn each day.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of words Bo already knows. Since he knew 20% of the 800 flashcards, we can find this by multiplying 800 by 20% (or 0.20):\n\\[\n800 \\times 0.20 = 160\n\\]\nSo, Bo knows 160 words.\n\nNext, we determine the number of words Bo still needs to learn. Since there are 800 words in total and he knows 160 of them, we subtract 160 from 800:\n\\[\n800 - 160 = 640\n\\]\nSo, Bo needs to learn 640 words.\n\nFinally, we find out how many words Bo needs to learn each day. Since he has 40 days to learn the remaining words, we divide 640 by 40:\n\\[\n640 \\div 40 = 16\n\\]\nSo, Bo needs to learn \\(\\boxed{16}\\) words a day.",

Subtract the number of words he knows from the total number of words to find out how many words he needs to learn.\n3. Divide the number of words he needs to learn by the number of days he has to learn them.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Bo knows 20% of the 800 flashcards. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   20\\% \\text{ of } 800 = 0.20 \\times 800 = 160\n   \\]\n   So, Bo knows 160 words.\n\n2.
