He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

This is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 2 = 4\n     \\]\n\n   Adding these together, the total number of slices Phill passes out is:\n   \\[\n   3 + 4 = 7\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of slices left for Phill:**\n   - Phill started with 8 slices.\n   - He passed out 7 slices.\n\n   Therefore, the number of slices left for Phill is:\n   \\[\n   8 - 7 = 1\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of slices of pizza left for Phill is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",

        "To determine how many slices of pizza are left for Phill, we start by calculating the total number of slices he has after cutting the pizza.\n\n1.
