Since each coconut tree yields 5 coconuts, we can find the number of trees by dividing the total number of coconuts needed by the number of coconuts each tree produces:\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{5} = 6\n\\]\nSo, Alvin has to harvest 6 coconut trees.\n\nTherefore, the number of coconut trees Alvin has to harvest is \\boxed{6}.",
