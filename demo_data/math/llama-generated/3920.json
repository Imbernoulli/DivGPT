        "To determine the total number of people the bus carried on its two trips, we need to calculate the number of people it carried on each trip and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of people the bus carried on its first trip from city A to city B.

So, we multiply the bus capacity by \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\):\n\n\\[\n200 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 200 \\times 0.75 = 150\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of people the bus carried on its return trip from city B to city A. The bus carried \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) of its capacity on this trip. So, we multiply the bus capacity by \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\):\n\n\\[\n200 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 200 \\times 0.8 = 160\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of people carried on both trips to find the total number of people the bus carried on the two trips:\n\n\\[\n150 + 160 = 310\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people the bus carried on the two trips is \\(\\boxed{310}\\).",
