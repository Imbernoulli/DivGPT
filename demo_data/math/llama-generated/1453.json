        "To determine the total number of days John spent protesting, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of days John spent at the first protest. According to the problem, he attended the first protest for 4 days.\n2. Calculate the number of days John spent at the second protest. The second protest lasted 25% longer than the first protest. First, we need to find out what 25% of 4 days is:\n   \\[\n   0.25 \\times 4 = 1 \\text{ day}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the second protest lasted:\n   \\[\n   4 + 1 = 5 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n3. Add the number of days spent at the first protest to the number of days spent at the second protest to find the total number of days John spent protesting:\n   \\[\n   4 + 5 = 9 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of days John spent protesting is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
