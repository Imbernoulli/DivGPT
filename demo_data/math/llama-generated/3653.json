        "To determine how much money Hawkeye was left with after charging his battery, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of charging the battery.\n2. Subtract the total cost of charging the battery from the initial budget.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of charging the battery. Hawkeye charged his battery four times, and each charge costs $3.5. So, we multiply the number of charges by the cost per charge:\n\\[ 4 \\times 3.5 = 14 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost of charging the battery from the initial budget. Hawkeye's initial budget was $20. So, we subtract $14 from $20:\n\\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Hawkeye was left with when he reached his aunt's place is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
