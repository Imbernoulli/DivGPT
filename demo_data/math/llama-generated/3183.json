        "To determine the total number of balls of wool used by Enid and Aaron, we need to calculate the amount of wool used by each person separately and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of wool used by Aaron. Aaron makes 10 scarves and 5 sweaters. Since each scarf uses 3 balls of wool and each sweater uses 4 balls of wool, we can calculate the total wool used by Aaron as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Wool used by Aaron} = (10 \\text{ scarves} \\times 3 \\text{ balls of wool per scarf}) + (5 \\text{ sweaters} \\times 4 \\text{ balls of wool per sweater})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Wool used by Aaron} = 30 \\text{ balls of wool} + 20 \\text{ balls of wool} = 50 \\text{ balls of wool}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of wool used by Enid. Enid makes 8 sweaters. Since each sweater uses 4 balls of wool, we can calculate the total wool used by Enid as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Wool used by Enid} = 8 \\text{ sweaters} \\times 4 \\text{ balls of wool per sweater} = 32 \\text{ balls of wool}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the amounts of wool used by Aaron and Enid to find the total amount of wool used:\n\\[\n\\text{Total wool used} = \\text{Wool used by Aaron} + \\text{Wool used by Enid} = 50 \\text{ balls of wool} + 32 \\text{ balls of wool} = 82 \\text{ balls of wool}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of balls of wool used by Enid and Aaron is \\boxed{82}.",
        "To determine the total number of balls of wool used by Enid and Aaron, we need to calculate the wool used by each person separately and then sum the two amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the wool used by Aaron:\n- Aaron makes 10 scarves.
