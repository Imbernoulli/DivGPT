        "To determine the total amount James pays per episode for all the characters on his TV show, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the payment for each major character.\n2. Calculate the total payment for all major characters.\n3. Calculate the total payment for all minor characters.\n4. Add the total payments for major and minor characters to get the total payment per episode.\n\nFirst, we know that each minor character is paid $15,000 per episode. Since there are 4 minor characters, the total payment for minor characters is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 15000 = 60000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we know that each major character is paid three times as much as a minor character. Therefore, each major character is paid:\n\\[ 3 \\times 15000 = 45000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nSince there are 5 major characters, the total payment for major characters is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 45000 = 225000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the total payments for major and minor characters to get the total payment per episode:\n\\[ 60000 + 225000 = 285000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount James pays per episode is:\n\\[ \\boxed{285000} \\]",

The total pay for all the minor characters is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 15,000 = 60,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTo find the total pay per episode, we add the pay for the main characters and the pay for the minor characters:\n\\[ 225,000 + 60,000 = 285,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount James pays per episode is:\n\\[ \\boxed{285000} \\]",

Since each minor character is paid $15,000, each main character is paid:\n\\[ 3 \\times 15,000 = 45,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total payment for all the main characters is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 45,000 = 225,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total payment for the minor characters. There are 4 minor characters, and each minor character is paid $15,000. Therefore, the total payment for all the minor characters is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 15,000 = 60,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the total payment for the main characters and the total payment for the minor characters to find the total payment per episode:\n\\[ 225,000 + 60,000 = 285,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount James pays per episode is:\n\\[ \\boxed{285000} \\]",
