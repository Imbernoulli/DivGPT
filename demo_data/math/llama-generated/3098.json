        "To determine the completion time of the student who came first, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total completion time for all four runners.\n2. Calculate the total completion time for the last three runners.\n3. Use the difference between these two totals to find the completion time of the first runner.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total completion time for all four runners. The average completion time of all four runners is 30 seconds. Therefore, the total completion time for all four runners is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 30 = 120 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total completion time for the last three runners. The average completion time of the last three students is 35 seconds. Therefore, the total completion time for the last three runners is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 35 = 105 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the completion time of the first runner by subtracting the total completion time of the last three runners from the total completion time of all four runners:\n\\[\n120 - 105 = 15 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nThus, the completion time of the student who came first is \\(\\boxed{15}\\) seconds.",
        "Let's denote the completion times of the four students as \\( t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4 \\), where \\( t_1 \\) is the time taken by the first student, \\( t_2 \\) by the second, \\( t_3 \\) by the third, and \\( t_4 \\) by the fourth. We are given two pieces of information:\n\n1. The average completion time of the last three students is 35 seconds.\n2. The average completion time of all four runners is 30 seconds.\n\nFrom the first piece of information, we can write the equation for the average time of the last three students:\n\\[\n\\frac{t_2 + t_3 + t_4}{3} = 35\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\\[\nt_2 + t_3 + t_4 = 105\n\\]\n\nFrom the second piece of information, we can write the equation for the average time of all four students:\n\\[\n\\frac{t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4}{4} = 30\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get:\n\\[\nt_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 = 120\n\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of \\( t_2 + t_3 + t_4 \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[\nt_1 + 105 = 120\n\\]\nSubtracting 105 from both sides, we get:\n\\[\nt_1 = 15\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the time it took the student who came first to finish the race is \\(\\boxed{15}\\) seconds.",
