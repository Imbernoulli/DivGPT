Therefore, the equation for the average score over all 5 quizzes is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{368 + x}{5} = 93\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[\n368 + x = 93 \\times 5\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( 93 \\times 5 \\):\n\n\\[\n93 \\times 5 = 465\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n368 + x = 465\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we subtract 368 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = 465 - 368\n\\]\n\nFinally, we perform the subtraction:\n\n\\[\nx = 97\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Amanda needs to score \\(\\boxed{97}\\) on her final quiz to achieve an average of 93% over the 5 quizzes.",
