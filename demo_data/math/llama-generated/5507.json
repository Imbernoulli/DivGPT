        "To determine how much less Andy weighs now than at the beginning of the year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Andy's weight after he gained 36 pounds.\n2. Determine Andy's weight after he loses an eighth of his weight every month for 3 months.\n3. Find the difference between Andy's initial weight and his current weight.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Andy's weight after he gained 36 pounds.**\n\nAndy's initial weight is 156 pounds. After gaining 36 pounds, his weight becomes:\n\\[ 156 + 36 = 192 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine Andy's weight after he loses an eighth of his weight every month for 3 months.**\n\nFirst, we calculate the weight loss for one month. An eighth of Andy's weight after gaining 36 pounds is:\n\\[ \\frac{192}{8} = 24 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSince Andy loses 24 pounds each month, after 3 months, the total weight loss is:\n\\[ 24 \\times 3 = 72 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy's weight after 3 months of exercise is:\n\\[ 192 - 72 = 120 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between Andy's initial weight and his current weight.**\n\nThe difference between Andy's initial weight and his current weight is:\n\\[ 156 - 120 = 36 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSo, Andy weighs \\(\\boxed{36}\\) pounds less now than at the beginning of the year.",

Again, an eighth of his weight is 24 pounds, so after the second month, his weight is:\n\\[ 168 - 24 = 144 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nFinally, calculate the weight loss for the third month. An eighth of his weight is still 24 pounds, so after the third month, his weight is:\n\\[ 144 - 24 = 120 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between Andy's original weight and his current weight.**\n\nAndy's original weight is 156 pounds, and his current weight is 120 pounds.

After gaining 36 pounds, his weight is:\n\\[ 156 + 36 = 192 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine Andy's weight after he loses an eighth of his weight every month over the next 3 months.**\n\nFirst, we calculate the weight loss for one month. Since he loses an eighth of his weight each month, we need to find one eighth of 192 pounds:\n\\[ \\frac{192}{8} = 24 \\text{ pounds} \\]\nSo, after one month, his weight is:\n\\[ 192 - 24 = 168 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the weight loss for the second month. Again, he loses one eighth of his weight, which is 24 pounds:\n\\[ 168 - 24 = 144 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the weight loss for the third month. He loses one eighth of his weight again, which is 24 pounds:\n\\[ 144 - 24 = 120 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSo, after 3 months of exercise, Andy's weight is 120 pounds.\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between Andy's original weight and his current weight.**\n\nThe original weight was 156 pounds, and the current weight is 120 pounds. The difference is:\n\\[ 156 - 120 = 36 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy weighs \\(\\boxed{36}\\) pounds less now than at the beginning of the year.",
