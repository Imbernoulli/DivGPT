        "To determine the total money saved for holiday spending by Victory and Sam, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how much Sam saves.\n2. Determine how much Victory saves.\n3. Add the savings of Sam and Victory together.\n\nFirst, we know that Sam saves $1000. According to the problem, Victory saves $100 less than Sam. Therefore, we can calculate Victory's savings as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Victory's savings} = \\text{Sam's savings} - 100 = 1000 - 100 = 900 \\]\n\nNext, we add the savings of Sam and Victory together to find the total money saved:\n\\[ \\text{Total savings} = \\text{Sam's savings} + \\text{Victory's savings} = 1000 + 900 = 1900 \\]\n\nThus, the total money saved for holiday spending is \\(\\boxed{1900}\\).",
