        "To determine the weight of the cat's bowl after she only ate 14 grams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of food added to the bowl when it is refilled.\n2. Subtract the amount of food the cat ate from the total amount of food added.\n3. Add the remaining food to the weight of the empty bowl.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of food added to the bowl when it is refilled. Since the cat is given 60 grams of food per day and the bowl is refilled every 3 days, the total amount of food added is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ grams/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 180 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount of food the cat ate from the total amount of food added. The cat ate 14 grams, so the amount of food remaining in the bowl is:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ grams} - 14 \\text{ grams} = 166 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the remaining food to the weight of the empty bowl. The empty bowl weighs 420 grams, so the total weight of the bowl is:\n\\[ 420 \\text{ grams} + 166 \\text{ grams} = 586 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\nTherefore, the weight of the cat's bowl after she only ate 14 grams is \\(\\boxed{586}\\).",
        "To determine the weight of the cat's bowl after she ate 14 grams, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of food given to the cat in 3 days.\n2.

Add the weight of the food left to the weight of the empty bowl.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of food given to the cat in 3 days. The cat is given 60 grams of food per day, so in 3 days the total amount of food is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ grams/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 180 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much food is left after the cat eats 14 grams.
