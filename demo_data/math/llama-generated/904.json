She needs to figure out how many pieces of silverware she should purchase. She needs spoons, butter knives, steak knives, and forks. For herself she figures 5 of each would be sufficient. But in case she has guests, she wants to have 10 extra pieces of each type. Then she realizes that if everything is clean at the same time, that she will have too many of everything and not enough room to fit them in her kitchen silverware drawer. So she decides to purchase 4 fewer spoons, 4 fewer butter knives, 5 fewer steak knives, and 3 fewer forks. How many pieces total of all the silverware is Stephanie going to buy?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
