Calculate the total number of chaperones.\n3. Find the total number of people going on the trip.\n4. Determine how many buses are needed by dividing the total number of people by the number of seats per bus.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students.**\n\nThe number of fifth graders is 109.\nThe number of sixth graders is 115.\nThe number of seventh graders is 118.\n\n\\[\n109 + 115 + 118 = 342\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of students is 342.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of chaperones.**\n\nThere are 4 teachers and 2 parents from each grade. Therefore, the total number of chaperones per grade is:\n\n\\[\n4 + 2 = 6\n\\]\n\nSince there are three grades, the total number of chaperones is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 3 = 18\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of chaperones is 18.\n\n**Step 3: Find the total number of people going on the trip.**\n\nThe total number of people going on the trip is the sum of the total number of students and the total number of chaperones:\n\n\\[\n342 + 18 = 360\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of people going on the trip is 360.\n\n**Step 4: Determine how many buses are needed.**\n\nEach school bus has 72 seats. To find out how many buses are needed, we divide the total number of people by the number of seats per bus:\n\n\\[\n360 \\div 72 = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of buses needed is 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
