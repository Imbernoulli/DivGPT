        "To determine the number of black butterflies Martha has, we start by analyzing the information given:\n\n1. Martha has a total of 19 butterflies.\n2. She has twice as many blue butterflies as yellow butterflies.\n3. She has 6 blue butterflies.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many yellow butterflies Martha has. Since she has twice as many blue butterflies as yellow butterflies, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue butterflies} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of yellow butterflies}\n\\]\nGiven that the number of blue butterflies is 6, we substitute 6 into the equation:\n\\[\n6 = 2 \\times \\text{Number of yellow butterflies}\n\\]\nTo find the number of yellow butterflies, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of yellow butterflies} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we know the total number of butterflies is 19. We have already determined the number of blue butterflies (6) and the number of yellow butterflies (3). To find the number of black butterflies, we subtract the number of blue and yellow butterflies from the total number of butterflies:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of black butterflies} = \\text{Total number of butterflies} - \\text{Number of blue butterflies} - \\text{Number of yellow butterflies}\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of black butterflies} = 19 - 6 - 3\n\\]\nPerforming the subtraction:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of black butterflies} = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of black butterflies Martha has is \\boxed{10}.",

Therefore, we can calculate the number of yellow butterflies as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of yellow butterflies} = \\frac{\\text{Number of blue butterflies}}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the number of blue butterflies and yellow butterflies to find the total number of blue and yellow butterflies:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of blue and yellow butterflies} = \\text{Number of blue butterflies} + \\text{Number of yellow butterflies} = 6 + 3 = 9\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of blue and yellow butterflies from the total number of butterflies to find the number of black butterflies:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of black butterflies} = \\text{Total number of butterflies} - \\text{Total number of blue and yellow butterflies} = 19 - 9 = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of black butterflies Martha has is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

To find the number of black butterflies, we subtract the number of blue and yellow butterflies from the total number of butterflies:\n\\[ \\text{Number of black butterflies} = \\text{Total number of butterflies} - \\text{Number of blue butterflies} - \\text{Number of yellow butterflies} \\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[ \\text{Number of black butterflies} = 19 - 6 - 3 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of black butterflies Martha has is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
