Add the amounts spent by Aitana and Jayda to find the total.\n\nFirst, we know that Jayda spent $400.\n\nNext, we are told that Aitana spent \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times more money than Jayda. This means that Aitana spent the amount Jayda spent plus \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the amount Jayda spent. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount Aitana spent} = \\text{Amount Jayda spent} + \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\text{Amount Jayda spent}\n\\]\nSubstituting the amount Jayda spent into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount Aitana spent} = 400 + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 400\n\\]\nTo calculate \\(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 400\\), we multiply 400 by \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times 400 = \\frac{2 \\times 400}{5} = \\frac{800}{5} = 160\n\\]\nSo, Aitana spent:\n\\[\n400 + 160 = 560\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the amounts spent by Aitana and Jayda to find the total amount of money they spent together:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount spent} = \\text{Amount Aitana spent} + \\text{Amount Jayda spent} = 560 + 400 = 960\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money they spent together is \\(\\boxed{960}\\).",
