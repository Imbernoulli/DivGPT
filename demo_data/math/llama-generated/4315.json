Let's denote the cost of the milkshake by \\(x\\). According to the problem, after buying the milkshake, Ivan had $3 left. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n8 - x = 3\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\(x\\), we need to isolate \\(x\\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 3 from 8:\n\n\\[\nx = 8 - 3 = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the milkshake is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
        "To determine how much Ivan spent on the milkshake, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount Ivan spent on cupcakes:**\n   Ivan started with $10 and spent \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of it on cupcakes.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on cupcakes} = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the remaining amount after buying cupcakes:**\n   Ivan initially had $10 and spent $2 on cupcakes.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining amount after cupcakes} = 10 - 2 = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the amount spent on the milkshake:**\n   Ivan had $8 left after buying cupcakes and ended with $3 after buying the milkshake.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on milkshake} = 8 - 3 = 5\n   \\]\n\nThus, the amount spent on the milkshake is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
