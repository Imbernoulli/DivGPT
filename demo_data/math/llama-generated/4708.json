        "To determine the total number of books Matias sold over the three days, we need to calculate the number of books sold each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many books Matias sold on Wednesday. According to the problem, he sold three times as many books on Wednesday as he did on Tuesday. Since he sold 7 books on Tuesday, we calculate the Wednesday sales as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Wednesday sales} = 3 \\times 7 = 21\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many books Matias sold on Thursday. The problem states that the sales from Wednesday were tripled on Thursday. Therefore, we calculate the Thursday sales as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Thursday sales} = 3 \\times 21 = 63\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum up the sales from all three days to find the total number of books sold:\n\\[\n\\text{Total sales} = \\text{Tuesday sales} + \\text{Wednesday sales} + \\text{Thursday sales} = 7 + 21 + 63\n\\]\n\nAdding these together, we get:\n\\[\n7 + 21 = 28\n\\]\n\\[\n28 + 63 = 91\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of books Matias sold during these three days combined is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{91}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of books Matias sold over the three days, we need to calculate the sales for each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that Matias sold 7 books on Tuesday.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many books he sold on Wednesday. According to the problem, he sold three times as many books on Wednesday as he did on Tuesday.
