Therefore, the number of peach trees planted is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 58 = 174 \\]\n\nStep 3: Add the number of apricot trees and peach trees to get the total number of trees planted.\nThe total number of trees planted is the sum of the apricot trees and the peach trees:\n\\[ 58 + 174 = 232 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of trees planted is \\(\\boxed{232}\\)."
