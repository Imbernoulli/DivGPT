        "To determine the total time it takes Jack and his toddlers to get ready, we need to consider the time it takes Jack to put his shoes on and the time it takes him to help each toddler with their shoes.\n\n1. Jack takes 4 minutes to put his shoes on.\n2. Jack takes 3 minutes longer to help each toddler with their shoes. Since each toddler takes 3 minutes longer than Jack to tie their shoes, and Jack takes 4 minutes to put his shoes on, each toddler takes \\(4 + 3 = 7\\) minutes to tie their shoes. Therefore, Jack takes 7 minutes to help each toddler.\n3. Since Jack has two toddlers, he spends \\(7 + 7 = 14\\) minutes helping both toddlers with their shoes.\n\nNow, we add the time Jack takes to put his shoes on to the time he takes to help both toddlers:\n\\[4 + 14 = 18\\]\n\nThus, the total time it takes them to get ready is \\(\\boxed{18}\\) minutes.",
