        "To determine how much Daniel spent on all the games in his collection, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the cost of each type of game separately.\n\nFirst, we know that Daniel has a total of 346 video games. Out of these, 80 games were bought for $12 each. We can calculate the total cost of these games as follows:\n\\[\n80 \\times 12 = 960\n\\]\nSo, Daniel spent $960 on the 80 games.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many of the remaining games were bought for $7 each. The number of remaining games is:\n\\[\n346 - 80 = 266\n\\]\n_of these 266 games, 50% were bought for $7 each. Therefore, the number of games bought for $7 each is:\n\\[\n266 \\times 0.5 = 133\n\\]\nWe can calculate the total cost of these games as follows:\n\\[\n133 \\times 7 = 931\n\\]\nSo, Daniel spent $931 on the 133 games.\n\nThe remaining games were bought for $3 each. The number of remaining games is:\n\\[\n266 - 133 = 133\n\\]\nWe can calculate the total cost of these games as follows:\n\\[\n133 \\times 3 = 399\n\\]\nSo, Daniel spent $399 on the 133 games.\n\nFinally, we add up the costs of all the games to find the total amount Daniel spent:\n\\[\n960 + 931 + 399 = 2290\n\\]\nTherefore, the total amount Daniel spent on all the games in his collection is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2290}\n\\]",

Therefore, the number of games bought for $7 each is:\n\\[\n0.50 \\times 266 = 133\n\\]\nThe cost of these 133 games is:\n\\[\n133 \\times 7 = 931\n\\]\nThe remaining games were bought for $3 each. The number of these games is:\n\\[\n266 - 133 = 133\n\\]\nThe cost of these 133 games is:\n\\[\n133 \\times 3 = 399\n\\]\nNow, we add up the costs of all the games to find the total amount Daniel spent:\n\\[\n960 + 931 + 399 = 2290\n\\]\nThus, the total amount Daniel spent on all the games in his collection is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2290}\n\\]",
