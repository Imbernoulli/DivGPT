Let's denote the number of votes for the witch cake as \\( W \\). According to the problem, \\( W = 7 \\).\n\nThe number of votes for the unicorn cake is three times the number of votes for the witch cake. Therefore, the number of votes for the unicorn cake is:\n\\[ 3W = 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\]\n\nThe number of votes for the dragon cake is 25 more than the number of votes for the witch cake. Therefore, the number of votes for the dragon cake is:\n\\[ W + 25 = 7 + 25 = 32 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the votes for all three cakes to find the total number of votes cast:\n\\[ W + 3W + (W + 25) = 7 + 21 + 32 = 60 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of votes cast is:\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",

Let's denote the number of votes for the witch cake as \\( W \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ W = 7 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that three times as many people voted for the unicorn cake as for the witch cake.
