From the previous rescue, we know that Jamie climbed 12 rungs to reach a height of 6 feet. Therefore, the height per rung is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height per rung} = \\frac{6 \\text{ feet}}{12 \\text{ rungs}} = 0.5 \\text{ feet per rung}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many rungs are required to reach a height of 20 feet. We do this by dividing the total height of the tree by the height per rung:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of rungs needed} = \\frac{20 \\text{ feet}}{0.5 \\text{ feet per rung}} = 40 \\text{ rungs}\n\\]\n\nThus, Jamie has to climb \\boxed{40} rungs to get the cat down from the 20-foot tree.",
