        "To determine the total number of pieces of bread thrown in the pond, let's denote the total number of pieces of bread as \\( x \\).\n\nWe know the following:\n1.

There are 30 pieces of bread left in the water.\n\nThe total number of pieces of bread eaten by the ducks and the pieces of bread left in the water should sum up to the total number of pieces of bread thrown in the pond.
