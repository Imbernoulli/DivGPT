        "To determine how much more candy Roger had compared to Sandra, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them had and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of candy Sandra had:\n- Sandra had 2 bags of candy.\n- Each bag had 6 pieces of candy.\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ bags} \\times 6 \\text{ pieces per bag} = 12 \\text{ pieces of candy}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of candy Roger had:\n- Roger had 2 bags of candy.\n- One bag had 11 pieces of candy.\n- The other bag had 3 pieces of candy.\n\n\\[\n11 \\text{ pieces} + 3 \\text{ pieces} = 14 \\text{ pieces of candy}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the total amount of candy Roger had and the total amount of candy Sandra had:\n\n\\[\n14 \\text{ pieces} - 12 \\text{ pieces} = 2 \\text{ pieces}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Roger had \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more pieces of candy than Sandra.",
        "To determine how much more candy Roger had than Sandra, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pieces of candy Sandra had.\n2. Calculate the total number of pieces of candy Roger had.\n3. Find the difference between the total number of pieces of candy Roger had and the total number of pieces of candy Sandra had.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of candy Sandra had.**\n\nSandra had 2 bags of candy, and each bag had 6 pieces. Therefore, we multiply the number of bags by the number of pieces per bag:\n\\[\n2 \\times 6 = 12\n\\]\nSo, Sandra had 12 pieces of candy.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces of candy Roger had.**\n\nRoger had 2 bags of candy. One bag had 11 pieces, and the other had 3 pieces. Therefore, we add the number of pieces in each bag:\n\\[\n11 + 3 = 14\n\\]\nSo, Roger had 14 pieces of candy.\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between the total number of pieces of candy Roger had and the total number of pieces of candy Sandra had.**\n\nTo find out how much more candy Roger had than Sandra, we subtract the total number of pieces of candy Sandra had from the total number of pieces of candy Roger had:\n\\[\n14 - 12 = 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Roger had \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more pieces of candy than Sandra.",
