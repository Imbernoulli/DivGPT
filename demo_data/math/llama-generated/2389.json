        "To determine how many beads were removed from each part, we start by calculating the total number of beads initially poured into the bowl. The girl has 23 blue beads and 16 yellow beads, so the total number of beads is:\n\\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \\]\n\nNext, we divide the total number of beads into 3 equal parts:\n\\[ \\frac{39}{3} = 13 \\]\nSo, each part initially contains 13 beads.\n\nAfter dividing the beads, the girl removes some beads from each part and doubles the rest to have 6 beads in each part. Let \\( x \\) be the number of beads removed from each part. Then, the number of beads left in each part after removing \\( x \\) beads is \\( 13 - x \\). When these remaining beads are doubled, the number of beads in each part becomes:\n\\[ 2(13 - x) \\]\nWe know that this equals 6 beads, so we set up the equation:\n\\[ 2(13 - x) = 6 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ 13 - x = 3 \\]\nNext, we subtract 13 from both sides:\n\\[ -x = 3 - 13 \\]\n\\[ -x = -10 \\]\nFinally, we multiply both sides by -1:\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of beads removed from each part is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",
