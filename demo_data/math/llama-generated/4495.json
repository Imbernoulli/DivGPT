        "To determine Irene's total income for working 50 hours last week, we need to break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime hours. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of regular hours and overtime hours:\n   - Regular hours: 40 hours\n   - Overtime hours: 50 hours - 40 hours = 10 hours\n\n2. Calculate the earnings from regular hours:\n   - Earnings from regular hours = $500\n\n3. Calculate the earnings from overtime hours:\n   - Earnings from overtime hours = 10 hours * $20/hour = $200\n\n4. Add the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours to get the total income:\n   - Total income = $500 + $200 = $700\n\nTherefore, Irene's total income for working 50 hours last week is \\(\\boxed{700}\\).",
