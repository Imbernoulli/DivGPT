        "To determine the final price of a set consisting of one cup of coffee and one piece of cheesecake with a 25% discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total price of the coffee and cheesecake without the discount.\n2. Determine the amount of the discount.\n3. Subtract the discount from the total price to find the final price.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total price without the discount.\nThe price of one cup of coffee is $6, and the price of one piece of cheesecake is $10. Therefore, the total price without the discount is:\n\\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \\]\n\nStep 2: Determine the amount of the discount.\nThe discount is 25%, so we need to calculate 25% of $16. To find 25% of $16, we multiply $16 by 0.25:\n\\[ 16 \\times 0.25 = 4 \\]\n\nStep 3: Subtract the discount from the total price to find the final price.\nThe final price is the total price without the discount minus the discount amount:\n\\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the final price of the set is:\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]",

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final price.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total cost of the coffee and cheesecake before the discount.\nThe cost of one cup of coffee is $6 and the cost of one piece of cheesecake is $10. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:\n\\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nStep 2: Determine the amount of the discount.\nThe discount is 25%, so we need to find 25% of $16. To do this, we multiply $16 by 0.25:\n\\[ 16 \\times 0.25 = 4 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nStep 3: Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final price.\nThe final price is the total cost before the discount minus the discount amount:\n\\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the final price of the set is:\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]",
