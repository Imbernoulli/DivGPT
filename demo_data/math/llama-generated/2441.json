        "To determine how many homes Kiaan still needs to distribute newspapers to, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many homes Kiaan has delivered newspapers to after the first hour. Since he has distributed newspapers to \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the 200 homes, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times 200 = \\frac{2 \\times 200}{5} = \\frac{400}{5} = 80\n\\]\nSo, after the first hour, Kiaan has delivered newspapers to 80 homes.

We calculate 60% of 120 as follows:\n\\[\n0.60 \\times 120 = 72\n\\]\nSo, after another 2 hours, Kiaan has delivered newspapers to an additional 72 homes. Since he had already delivered to 80 homes, the total number of homes he has delivered to after 3 hours is:\n\\[\n80 + 72 = 152\n\\]\nThis means there are \\( 200 - 152 = 48 \\) homes left.\n\nTherefore, the number of homes Kiaan still needs to distribute newspapers to is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{48}\n\\]",
