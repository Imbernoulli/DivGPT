        "To determine how many donuts each student who likes donuts gets to eat, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of donuts Noel bakes.\n2. Determine the number of students who like donuts.\n3. Divide the total number of donuts by the number of students who like donuts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of donuts Noel bakes. Since Noel bakes 4 dozen donuts and one dozen is equal to 12 donuts, we have:\n\\[ 4 \\times 12 = 48 \\text{ donuts} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of students who like donuts. There are 30 students in the class and 80% of them like donuts. Therefore, the number of students who like donuts is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 0.80 = 24 \\text{ students} \\]\n\nNow, we divide the total number of donuts by the number of students who like donuts to find out how many donuts each student who likes donuts gets to eat:\n\\[ \\frac{48}{24} = 2 \\text{ donuts} \\]\n\nThus, each student who likes donuts gets to eat \\(\\boxed{2}\\) donuts.",
