The recipe she is following calls for 3 tablespoons of soap for every 1 cup of water.  If the container she hopes to store the bubble mix in can hold 40 ounces of liquid, and there are 8 ounces in a cup of water, how many tablespoons of soap should she add to the container (assuming that the soap itself doesn't count towards the capacity of the container)?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
