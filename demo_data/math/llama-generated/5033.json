        "To determine how many apples Buffy stole from Carla, we start by identifying the initial number of apples Carla had and then account for the apples that were lost.\n\n1. Carla initially had 79 apples.\n2. 26 apples fell out of a hole in her backpack.\n3. At lunchtime, Carla had 8 apples remaining.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of apples Carla had after the apples fell out of the hole:\n\\[ 79 - 26 = 53 \\]\n\nNext, we know that after Buffy stole some apples, Carla had 8 apples left. Therefore, the number of apples Buffy stole is the difference between the number of apples Carla had after the apples fell out and the number of apples she had at lunchtime:\n\\[ 53 - 8 = 45 \\]\n\nThus, the number of apples Buffy stole from Carla is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
        "To determine how many apples Buffy stole from Carla, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the total number of apples Carla initially put in her backpack.\n2. Subtract the number of apples that fell out of the hole.\n3. Subtract the number of apples remaining at lunchtime.\n4. The result will be the number of apples stolen by Buffy.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Carla initially put 79 apples in her backpack.\n2. 26 apples fell out of the hole. So, we subtract 26 from 79:\n   \\[\n   79 - 26 = 53\n   \\]\n   This means that after the apples fell out, Carla had 53 apples left in her backpack.\n3. At lunchtime, Carla only had 8 apples remaining. So, we subtract the number of apples she had left at lunchtime from the number of apples she had after the apples fell out:\n   \\[\n   53 - 8 = 45\n   \\]\n   This means that Buffy stole 45 apples.\n\nTherefore, the number of apples Buffy stole from Carla is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",

Determine how many apples were lost after Buffy stole some and 26 apples fell out.\n3. Calculate the number of apples stolen by Buffy.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of apples Buffy stole as \\( x \\). According to the problem, Carla initially had 79 apples. After Buffy stole \\( x \\) apples, and 26 apples fell out, Carla was left with 8 apples. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation:\n\n\\[ 79 - x - 26 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we simplify the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 53 - x = 8 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we need to isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 8 from 53:\n\n\\[ 53 - 8 = x \\]\n\n\\[ 45 = x \\]\n\nSo, Buffy stole \\(\\boxed{45}\\) apples from Carla.",

This means the initial number of apples minus the total number of apples lost equals the remaining apples:\n   \\[\n   79 - (26 + x) = 8\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the equation:**\n   \\[\n   79 - 26 - x = 8\n   \\]\n\n5. **Combine the constants:**\n   \\[\n   53 - x = 8\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   Add \\( x \\) to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   53 = 8 + x\n   \\]\n\n   Subtract 8 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x = 45\n   \\]\n\nThus, Buffy stole \\(\\boxed{45}\\) apples from Carla.",

        "To determine how many apples Buffy stole from Carla, we start by calculating the total number of apples Carla initially had before any were stolen or fell out. Carla puts 79 apples in her backpack every morning.\n\nNext, we account for the apples that fell out of the hole. According to the problem, 26 apples fell out. Therefore, the number of apples remaining after the apples fell out is:\n\\[ 79 - 26 = 53 \\]\n\nAt lunchtime, Carla only had 8 apples left. This means that Buffy must have stolen the difference between the number of apples remaining after the apples fell out and the number of apples Carla had at lunchtime. So, the number of apples Buffy stole is:\n\\[ 53 - 8 = 45 \\]\n\nThus, the number of apples Buffy stole from Carla is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
        "Let's start by determining the initial number of apples Carla put in her backpack. According to the problem, Carla put 79 apples in her backpack.\n\nNext, we need to account for the apples that were lost. We know that 26 apples fell out of a hole in the bottom of the backpack. Let's denote the number of apples stolen by Buffy as \\( x \\).\n\nThe total number of apples lost is the sum of the apples stolen by Buffy and the apples that fell out of the hole. Therefore, the total number of apples lost is \\( x + 26 \\).\n\nAfter losing these apples, Carla had 8 apples remaining. So, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation:\n\\[ 79 - (x + 26) = 8 \\]\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\\[ 79 - x - 26 = 8 \\]\n\\[ 53 - x = 8 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we need to isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 8 from 53:\n\\[ 53 - 8 = x \\]\n\\[ x = 45 \\]\n\nSo, Buffy stole \\(\\boxed{45}\\) apples from Carla.",
