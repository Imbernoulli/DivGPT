        "Let's define the cost of the dessert as \\( x \\) dollars. According to the problem, the entree costs $5 more than the dessert, so the cost of the entree is \\( x + 5 \\) dollars. The total cost of the entree and the dessert is $23. We can write this as the following equation:\n\n\\[ x + (x + 5) = 23 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x + 5 = 23 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x = 18 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ x = 9 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of the dessert is $9. Since the entree costs $5 more than the dessert, the cost of the entree is:\n\n\\[ x + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the entree is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
