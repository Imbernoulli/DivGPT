        "To determine how much Annie spent on candies, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of candies Annie bought.\n2. Determine the cost of the candies.\n\nFirst, we know that each classmate received 2 candies and there are 35 people in total. However, since Annie is also part of the class, we need to subtract her from the total number of classmates to find out how many classmates she gave candies to. The number of classmates is \\(35 - 1 = 34\\). Therefore, the total number of candies given to the classmates is:\n\\[\n34 \\times 2 = 68\n\\]\nAnnie was left with 12 candies, so the total number of candies she bought is:\n\\[\n68 + 12 = 80\n\\]\nNext, we need to find out how much Annie spent on these candies. Since each candy costs $0.1, the total cost is:\n\\[\n80 \\times 0.1 = 8\n\\]\nThus, the amount Annie spent on candies is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",

Since there are 35 people in her class, including herself, the number of classmates is \\(35 - 1 = 34\\). Therefore, the total number of candies given to her classmates is \\(34 \\times 2 = 68\\). Adding the 12 candies she had left, the total number of candies she bought is \\(68 + 12 = 80\\).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies. Since each candy costs $0.1, the total cost is \\(80 \\times 0.1 = 8\\) dollars.\n\nThus, the amount Annie spent on candies is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

Determine the cost of the candies.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many candies Annie bought. We know that each classmate got 2 candies and there are 35 people in total. However, since Annie is also a classmate, we need to subtract her from the total number of classmates to find out how many classmates she gave candies to. So, the number of classmates is \\(35 - 1 = 34\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of candies given to the classmates:\n\\[\n34 \\text{ classmates} \\times 2 \\text{ candies per classmate} = 68 \\text{ candies}\n\\]\n\nAfter giving out the candies, Annie was left with 12 candies. Therefore, the total number of candies Annie bought is:\n\\[\n68 \\text{ candies} + 12 \\text{ candies} = 80 \\text{ candies}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much Annie spent on the candies. We know that each candy costs $0.1, so the total cost is:\n\\[\n80 \\text{ candies} \\times 0.1 \\text{ dollars per candy} = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount Annie spent on candies is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
