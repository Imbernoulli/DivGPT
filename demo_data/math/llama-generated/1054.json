        "To determine how many boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across, we need to consider the width of each boat and the required spacing between them and the riverbank. Each boat is 3 feet wide, and there must be at least 2 feet between each boat or the riverbank.\n\nLet's denote the number of boats by \\( n \\). The total width occupied by the boats and the spaces between them can be expressed as follows:\n- The width of the boats is \\( 3n \\) feet.\n- The width of the spaces between the boats is \\( 2(n-1) \\) feet (since there are \\( n-1 \\) spaces between \\( n \\) boats).\n- The width of the spaces between the riverbank and the boats is \\( 2 \\) feet each (one on each side).\n\nTherefore, the total width occupied is:\n\\[ 3n + 2(n-1) + 2 \\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\\[ 3n + 2n - 2 + 2 = 5n \\]\n\nWe know that the total width of the river is 42 feet, so we set up the inequality:\n\\[ 5n \\leq 42 \\]\n\nSolve for \\( n \\):\n\\[ n \\leq \\frac{42}{5} = 8.4 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be a whole number, the maximum number of boats that can race is 8.\n\nTo verify, let's calculate the total width occupied by 8 boats:\n- The width of the boats is \\( 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\) feet.\n- The width of the spaces between the boats is \\( 2 \\times (8-1) = 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\) feet.\n- The width of the spaces between the riverbank and the boats is \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\) feet.\n\nThe total width occupied is:\n\\[ 24 + 14 + 4 = 42 \\] feet, which is exactly the width of the river.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of boats that can race in the river is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
        "To determine how many boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across, given that each boat is 3 feet wide and there must be at least 2 feet between them or the riverbank, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total space required for one boat and the space between it and the next boat or the riverbank:**\n   - Each boat is 3 feet wide.\n   - There must be at least 2 feet between each boat and the next boat or the riverbank.\n\n   Therefore, the total space required for one boat and the space next to it is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ feet (boat)} + 2 \\text{ feet (space)} = 5 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many such spaces can fit in the 42-foot-wide river:**\n   - The river is 42 feet across.\n   - Each space requires 5 feet.\n\n   To find the number of spaces, we divide the total width of the river by the width of each space:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{42 \\text{ feet}}{5 \\text{ feet/space}} = 8.4 \\text{ spaces}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of boats:**\n   - Since we cannot have a fraction of a boat, we take the integer part of the number of spaces.\n\n   Therefore, the number of boats that can fit in the river is:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor 8.4 \\right\\rfloor = 8\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the arrangement:**\n   - If there are 8 boats, the total space occupied by the boats and the spaces between them is:\n     \\[\n     8 \\text{ boats} \\times 5 \\text{ feet/boat} = 40 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n   - This leaves:\n     \\[\n     42 \\text{ feet} - 40 \\text{ feet} = 2 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n   - There are 2 feet left, which satisfies the requirement of having at least 2 feet between the last boat and the riverbank.\n\nThus, the maximum number of boats that can race in the river is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
