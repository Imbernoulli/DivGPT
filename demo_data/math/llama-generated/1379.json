Therefore, the number of English-language books is:\n\\[ 2300 \\times 0.80 = 1840. \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these English-language books were published in the country. We know that 60% of the English-language books were published in the country. Therefore, the number of English-language books published in the country is:\n\\[ 1840 \\times 0.60 = 1104. \\]\n\nTo find the number of English-language books published outside the country, we subtract the number of English-language books published in the country from the total number of English-language books:\n\\[ 1840 - 1104 = 736. \\]\n\nThus, the number of English-language books that have been published outside the country is:\n\\[ \\boxed{736}. \\]",
