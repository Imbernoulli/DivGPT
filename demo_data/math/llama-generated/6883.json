        "To find the total amount Ariana owes, we need to calculate the interest or fees for each bill individually and then sum them up.\n\n**First Bill:**\nThe first bill is $200 and it charges 10% simple interest for each overdue month. Since the bill is 2 months overdue, the interest is:\n\\[ 200 \\times 10\\% \\times 2 = 200 \\times 0.10 \\times 2 = 40 \\]\nSo, the total amount for the first bill is:\n\\[ 200 + 40 = 240 \\]\n\n**Second Bill:**\nThe second bill is $130 and it charges a flat $50 late fee per month. Since the bill is 6 months overdue, the total late fee is:\n\\[ 50 \\times 6 = 300 \\]\nSo, the total amount for the second bill is:\n\\[ 130 + 300 = 430 \\]\n\n**Third Bill:**\nThe third bill is $444 and it charges a $40 fee the first month overdue and twice that fee the second month overdue. Since the bill is 2 months overdue, the total late fee is:\n\\[ 40 + 2 \\times 40 = 40 + 80 = 120 \\]\nSo, the total amount for the third bill is:\n\\[ 444 + 120 = 564 \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the total amounts for all three bills:\n\\[ 240 + 430 + 564 = 1234 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Ariana owes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1234} \\]",
