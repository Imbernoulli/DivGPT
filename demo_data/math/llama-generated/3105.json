Raymond also receives $2.50 from his grandmother. Since 1 dime is worth 10 cents, 7 dimes are worth:\n\\[ 7 \\times 10 = 70 \\text{ cents} \\]\nThis means Raymond has 70 cents left after spending some of his money. Therefore, the amount Raymond spends is:\n\\[ 250 - 70 = 180 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNow, we add the amounts spent by Pete and Raymond to find the total amount spent:\n\\[ 20 + 180 = 200 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount spent by Pete and Raymond altogether is:\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]",
