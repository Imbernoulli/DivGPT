        "To determine how much money Olivia and Nigel have left after buying six one-day passes to a tourist attraction, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the six one-day passes.\n2. Subtract the total cost of the passes from the combined amount of money Olivia and Nigel have.\n\nFirst, let's find the total cost of the six one-day passes. Each pass costs $28, so the cost for six passes is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 28 = 168\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Olivia and Nigel have together. Olivia has $112 and Nigel has $139, so their combined amount of money is:\n\\[\n112 + 139 = 251\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total cost of the passes from their combined amount of money to find out how much money they have left:\n\\[\n251 - 168 = 83\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Olivia and Nigel have left is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{83}\n\\]",
