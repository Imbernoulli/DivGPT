She can't decide if she will make cherry or blueberry. So she decides to make whichever pie is cheapest. Both pies will need $2 for flour, $1 for sugar and $1.5 for eggs and butter to make the crust. The blueberry pie needs 3 pounds of blueberries. The blueberries come in 8 oz containers for $2.25. For the cherry pie, she needs 4 pounds and they come in a four-pound bag for $14. What is the total price to make the cheapest pie?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Each container of blueberries is 8 ounces and costs $2.25. Therefore, the number of containers needed is \\(48 \\div 8 = 6\\).\n4. The cost of the blueberries is \\(6 \\times 2.25 = 13.5\\).\n5. The total cost of the blueberry pie is \\(4.5 + 13.5 = 18\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the cherry pie:\n1. The cost of the crust is $2 + $1 + $1.5 = $4.5.\n2. The cherry pie needs 4 pounds of cherries, and they come in a four-pound bag for $14. Therefore, the cost of the cherries is $14.\n3. The total cost of the cherry pie is \\(4.5 + 14 = 18.5\\).\n\nComparing the two costs, the blueberry pie is cheaper at $18 compared to the cherry pie at $18.5.

The cost of the crust is $2 (flour) + $1 (sugar) + $1.5 (eggs and butter) = $4.5.\n2. The blueberry pie needs 3 pounds of blueberries. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, 3 pounds is equal to 3 * 16 = 48 ounces. Each container of blueberries is 8 ounces and costs $2.25, so we need 48 / 8 = 6 containers. The cost for the blueberries is 6 * $2.25 = $13.5.\n3. The total cost of the blueberry pie is $4.5 (crust) + $13.5 (blueberries) = $18.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the cherry pie:\n1. The cost of the crust is $2 (flour) + $1 (sugar) + $1.5 (eggs and butter) = $4.5.\n2. The cherry pie needs 4 pounds of cherries. Since they come in a four-pound bag for $14, we only need one bag. The cost for the cherries is $14.\n3. The total cost of the cherry pie is $4.5 (crust) + $14 (cherries) = $18.5.\n\nComparing the two costs, the blueberry pie is cheaper at $18 compared to the cherry pie at $18.5. Therefore, the total price to make the cheapest pie is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
        "To determine the cheapest pie to make, we need to calculate the total cost for both the cherry pie and the blueberry pie and then compare the two.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the blueberry pie:\n1.
