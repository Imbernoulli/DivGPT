        "To determine how many packets of corn chips John can buy, we first need to calculate how much money he will spend on the chips. John wants to buy 15 packets of chips, and each packet costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the chips is:\n\n\\[ 15 \\times 2 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount spent on chips from John's total amount of money to find out how much money he has left to buy corn chips. John has $45 in total, so the remaining amount of money is:\n\n\\[ 45 - 30 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nEach packet of corn chips costs $1.5. To find out how many packets of corn chips John can buy with the remaining $15, we divide the remaining amount by the cost per packet of corn chips:\n\n\\[ 15 \\div 1.5 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, John can buy \\(\\boxed{10}\\) packets of corn chips.",

Determine how many packets of corn chips John can buy with the remaining money.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of one packet of chips is $2. Therefore, the cost of 15 packets of chips is:\n   \\[\n   15 \\times 2 = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. John has $45 in total. After buying the chips, the amount of money he has left is:\n   \\[\n   45 - 30 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. The cost of one packet of corn chips is $1.5. Therefore, the number of packets of corn chips John can buy with $15 is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15}{1.5} = 10\n   \\]\n\nSo, John can buy \\(\\boxed{10}\\) packets of corn chips.",
