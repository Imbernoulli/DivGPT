        "To determine the final amount paid after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the original purchase amount, which is $250.\n2. Determine the discount amount. The discount is $10 for every $100 spent. Since $250 is equivalent to 2.5 times $100, we can calculate the discount as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount} = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   (Note that we only consider the whole number part of 2.5, which is 2, because you don't get a discount for a fraction of $100.)\n3. Subtract the discount from the original purchase amount to find the final amount paid:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Amount Paid} = 250 - 20 = 230 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final amount paid is \\(\\boxed{230}\\).",
        "To determine the final amount paid after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the discount amount:**\n   - The discount is $10 for every $100 spent.\n   - First, find out how many $100 increments are in $250.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{250}{100} = 2.5\n   \\]\n   - Since the discount only applies to full $100 increments, we take the integer part of 2.5, which is 2.\n   - Now, calculate the discount for 2 increments.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 10 = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the discount from the original amount:**\n   - The original amount before the discount is $250.\n   - Subtract the discount amount from the original amount.\n   \\[\n   250 - 20 = 230\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final amount paid after the discount is \\(\\boxed{230}\\).",
