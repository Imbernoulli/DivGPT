        "To determine the number of goats Zara owns, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has. We know that she will transport all of her animals to a new farm in 3 equally-sized groups, with each group containing 48 animals. Therefore, the total number of animals is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 48 = 144 \\]\n\nNext, we know the number of cows and sheep Zara has. She bought 24 cows and 7 sheep, so the total number of cows and sheep is:\n\n\\[ 24 + 7 = 31 \\]\n\nLet \\( g \\) be the number of goats Zara owns. The total number of animals is the sum of the number of cows, sheep, and goats, which gives us the equation:\n\n\\[ 31 + g = 144 \\]\n\nTo find \\( g \\), we subtract 31 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ g = 144 - 31 = 113 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of goats Zara owns is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{113} \\]",

Subtract the number of cows and sheep from the total number of animals to find the number of goats.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of animals Zara has. She has 24 cows, 7 sheep, and \\( g \\) goats. Therefore, the total number of animals is:\n\\[ 24 + 7 + g = 31 + g \\]\n\nNext, we know that Zara will transport all of her animals to a new farm in 3 equally-sized groups of 48 animals per group. So, the total number of animals she will transport is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 48 = 144 \\]\n\nSince the total number of animals she has must equal the total number of animals she will transport, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 31 + g = 144 \\]\n\nTo find the number of goats, we solve for \\( g \\) by subtracting 31 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ g = 144 - 31 = 113 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of goats Zara owns is:\n\\[ \\boxed{113} \\]",

Subtract the number of cows and sheep from the total number of animals to find the number of goats.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of animals Zara has on her farm. She has 24 cows, 7 sheep, and some goats. Let's denote the number of goats by \\( g \\). Therefore, the total number of animals is:\n\\[ 24 + 7 + g = 31 + g \\]\n\nNext, we know that Zara will transport all of her animals to a new farm in 3 equally-sized groups of 48 animals per group. Therefore, the total number of animals she will transport is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 48 = 144 \\]\n\nSince the total number of animals on her farm must equal the total number of animals she will transport, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 31 + g = 144 \\]\n\nTo find the number of goats, we solve for \\( g \\) by subtracting 31 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ g = 144 - 31 = 113 \\]\n\nThus, the number of goats Zara owns is:\n\\[ \\boxed{113} \\]",
