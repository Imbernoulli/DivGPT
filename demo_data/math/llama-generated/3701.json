        "To determine how many marbles each friend gets after combining and sharing them equally, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of marbles Ludo bought.\n2. Calculate the number of marbles Michael bought.\n3. Find the total number of marbles bought by all three friends.\n4. Divide the total number of marbles by 3 to find out how many each friend gets.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of marbles Ludo bought. Ludo bought \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) times more marbles than Wolfgang. Since Wolfgang bought 16 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles Ludo bought as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Marbles Ludo bought} = 16 + \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 16 + 4 = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of marbles Michael bought. Michael bought \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) times as many marbles as the total number of marbles bought by Wolfgang and Ludo. The total number of marbles bought by Wolfgang and Ludo is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total marbles bought by Wolfgang and Ludo} = 16 + 20 = 36\n\\]\nSo, the number of marbles Michael bought is:\n\\[\n\\text{Marbles Michael bought} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 36 = 24\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the total number of marbles bought by all three friends:\n\\[\n\\text{Total marbles} = 16 + 20 + 24 = 60\n\\]\n\nFinally, we divide the total number of marbles by 3 to find out how many each friend gets:\n\\[\n\\text{Marbles each friend gets} = \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, each friend gets \\(\\boxed{20}\\) marbles.",
