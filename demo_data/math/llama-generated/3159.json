        "To determine how many days the coffee will last Angie, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cups of coffee Angie can brew from 3 lbs. of coffee.\n2. Determine how many days the total number of cups will last if Angie drinks 3 cups per day.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of cups of coffee Angie can brew from 3 lbs. of coffee. Since each lb. of coffee brews about 40 cups, we multiply the number of pounds by the number of cups per pound:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ lbs.} \\times 40 \\text{ cups/lb.} = 120 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many days the 120 cups of coffee will last if Angie drinks 3 cups per day. We do this by dividing the total number of cups by the number of cups Angie drinks each day:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ cups} \\div 3 \\text{ cups/day} = 40 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, the coffee will last Angie \\boxed{40} days.",
