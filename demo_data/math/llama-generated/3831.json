        "Let's define the distance that Hiro walked as \\( h \\) kilometers. According to the problem, Rajesh walked 10 kilometers less than 4 times the distance that Hiro walked. Therefore, the distance that Rajesh walked can be expressed as \\( 4h - 10 \\) kilometers.\n\nThe problem also states that together they walked 25 kilometers.

        "Let's define the distance that Hiro walked as \\( h \\) kilometers. According to the problem, Rajesh walked 10 kilometers less than 4 times the distance that Hiro walked. Therefore, we can express the distance that Rajesh walked as \\( 4h - 10 \\) kilometers.\n\nThe problem also states that together they walked 25 kilometers. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ h + (4h - 10) = 25 \\]\n\nFirst, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 5h - 10 = 25 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate the term with \\( h \\) by adding 10 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 5h = 35 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by 5:\n\\[ h = 7 \\]\n\nNow that we know beans walked 7 kilometers, we can find out how many kilometers Rajesh walked by substituting \\( h = 7 \\) into the expression \\( 4h - 10 \\):\n\\[ 4(7) - 10 = 28 - 10 = 18 \\]\n\nTherefore, Rajesh walked \\(\\boxed{18}\\) kilometers.",
