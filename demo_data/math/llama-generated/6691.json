        "To find the total marks Teresa scored in all the subjects, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Teresa's score in physics.\n2. Add up the scores in science, music, social studies, and physics.\n\nFirst, we know that Teresa scored 80 marks in music. According to the problem, her score in physics is half of her score in music. Therefore, we calculate her physics score as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Physics score} = \\frac{80}{2} = 40\n\\]\n\nNext, we add up the scores in all four subjects: science, music, social studies, and physics.\n\\[\n\\text{Total score} = \\text{Science score} + \\text{Music score} + \\text{Social studies score} + \\text{Physics score}\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n\\text{Total score} = 70 + 80 + 85 + 40\n\\]\n\nNow, we perform the addition step by step:\n\\[\n70 + 80 = 150\n\\]\n\\[\n150 + 85 = 235\n\\]\n\\[\n235 + 40 = 275\n\\]\n\nThus, the total marks Teresa scored in all the subjects is \\boxed{275}.",
