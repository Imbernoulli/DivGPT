        "Let's start by determining how many candies Shelly originally had. According to the problem, after Shelly ate 20 candies, there were 50 candies left in the bowl. Therefore, the original number of candies Shelly had is:\n\n\\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many candies Shelly's friend brought over. The problem states that her friend brought twice as much candy as Shelly originally had. So, the number of candies her friend brought is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 70 = 140 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of candies in the bowl after Shelly's friend added her candies. The initial number of candies after Shelly ate was 50, and her friend added 140 candies. Therefore, the total number of candies in the bowl is:\n\n\\[ 50 + 140 = 190 \\]\n\nShelly and her friend decide to divide the candies equally.

        "Let's start by determining how many candies Shelly originally had before she ate 20 candies the previous week. Let's denote the original number of candies by \\( x \\). After Shelly ate 20 candies, there were 50 candies left in the bowl. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x - 20 = 50 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we add 20 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ x = 50 + 20 = 70 \\]\n\nSo, Shelly originally had 70 candies. Her friend brought twice as much candy as Shelly originally had, which is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 70 = 140 \\]\n\nShelly adds this 140 candies to the 50 candies that were already in the bowl, so the total number of candies in the bowl now is:\n\n\\[ 50 + 140 = 190 \\]\n\nShelly and her friend decide to divide the candies equally. Therefore, each of them gets:\n\n\\[ \\frac{190}{2} = 95 \\]\n\nAfter eating 10 of her candies, her friend has:\n\n\\[ 95 - 10 = 85 \\]\n\nSo, the number of candies her friend has after eating 10 of her candies is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{85} \\]",

Therefore, the initial number of candies Shelly had is:\n   \\[\n   50 + 20 = 70\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of candies Shelly's friend brought:**\n   Shelly's friend brought twice as much candy as she originally had. Since Shelly originally had 70 candies, her friend brought:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 70 = 140\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total number of candies in the bowl after adding the candies from her friend:**\n   The bowl initially had 50 candies, and Shelly added 140 candies. Therefore, the total number of candies in the bowl is:\n   \\[\n   50 + 140 = 190\n   \\]\n\n4. **Divide the candies equally between Shelly and her friend:**\n   Since they决定 to divide the candies equally, each person gets:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{190}{2} = 95\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of candies Shelly's friend has after eating 10 of her candies:**\n   Shelly's friend initially had 95 candies and ate 10 candies. Therefore, the number of candies her friend has after eating 10 is:\n   \\[\n   95 - 10 = 85\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{85}\n\\]",
        "Let's start by determining how many candies Shelly originally had before she ate any. Since there were 50 candies left after she ate 20 candies, we can calculate the original number of candies as follows:\n\\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \\]\nSo, Shelly originally had 70 candies.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many candies Shelly's friend brought over. Since her friend brought twice as much candy as Shelly originally had, we calculate:\n\\[ 2 \\times 70 = 140 \\]\nSo, Shelly's friend brought 140 candies.\n\nWhen Shelly adds the candies her friend brought to the bowl, the total number of candies becomes:\n\\[ 50 + 140 = 190 \\]\nShelly and her friend decide to divide these candies equally. Therefore, each of them gets:\n\\[ \\frac{190}{2} = 95 \\]\nSo, after dividing the candies equally, Shelly's friend has 95 candies.\n\nFinally, Shelly's friend eats 10 of her candies. The number of candies her friend has left is:\n\\[ 95 - 10 = 85 \\]\nThus, the number of candies Shelly's friend has after eating 10 of her candies is:\n\\[ \\boxed{85} \\]",
