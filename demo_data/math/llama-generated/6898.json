        "To determine how many friends received pebbles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pebbles Janice had.\n2. Determine how many pebbles each friend received.\n3. Divide the total number of pebbles by the number of pebbles each friend received to find out how many friends received pebbles.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pebbles Janice had. Since she gave all three dozens of pebbles, and one dozen equals 12 pebbles, we have:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ dozens} = 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\text{ pebbles} \\]\n\nNext, we know that each friend received 4 pebbles. To find out how many friends received pebbles, we divide the total number of pebbles by the number of pebbles each friend received:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ pebbles} \\div 4 \\text{ pebbles per friend} = 9 \\text{ friends} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of friends who received pebbles is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
        "To determine how many friends received pebbles, we start by calculating the total number of pebbles Janice had. She had three dozens of pebbles. Since one dozen equals 12 pebbles, we can find the total number of pebbles by multiplying 3 by 12:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many friends received pebbles if each friend got 4 pebbles. We do this by dividing the total number of pebbles by the number of pebbles each friend received:\n\n\\[ 36 \\div 4 = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of friends who received pebbles is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
