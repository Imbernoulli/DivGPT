        "To find the total number of oranges Nora picked, we need to add the number of oranges she picked from each tree. She picked 80 oranges from the first tree, 60 oranges from the second tree, and 120 oranges from the third tree. We can add these numbers together step by step.\n\nFirst, add the oranges from the first and second trees:\n\\[ 80 + 60 = 140 \\]\n\nNext, add the oranges from the third tree to the result:\n\\[ 140 + 120 = 260 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of oranges Nora picked is \\(\\boxed{260}\\).",
