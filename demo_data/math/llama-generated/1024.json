        "To determine how many hotel rooms the principal needs to book for 30 students, we start by analyzing the capacity of each room. Each room has two queen size beds and one pull-out couch.

Therefore, the total capacity of each room is:\n\n\\[2 \\text{ beds} \\times 2 \\text{ students/bed} + 1 \\text{ couch} \\times 1 \\text{ student/couch} = 4 \\text{ students} + 1 \\text{ student} = 5 \\text{ students}\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many rooms are required to accommodate all 30 students.

        "To determine how many hotel rooms the principal needs to book, we start by calculating the total capacity of each room. Each room has two queen size beds and one pull-out couch. Since each queen size bed can fit two students and the pull-out couch can fit one student, the total capacity of each room is:\n\n\\[2 \\text{ beds} \\times 2 \\text{ students/bed} + 1 \\text{ couch} \\times 1 \\text{ student/couch} = 4 \\text{ students} + 1 \\text{ student} = 5 \\text{ students}\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many rooms are required to accommodate all 30 students. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the capacity of each room:\n\n\\[30 \\text{ students} \\div 5 \\text{ students/room} = 6 \\text{ rooms}\\]\n\nSince 6 rooms will provide exactly 30 seats (6 rooms \\(\\times\\) 5 students/room = 30 students), the principal needs to book \\(\\boxed{6}\\) rooms."
