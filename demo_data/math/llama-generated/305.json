        "To determine how long it took Billy to swim his final lap, we need to calculate the total time he spent swimming all 10 laps and then subtract the time he spent on the first 9 laps from that total time.\n\nFirst, let's convert all the times to seconds for easier calculation:\n- Billy swims his first 5 laps in 2 minutes, which is \\(2 \\times 60 = 120\\) seconds.\n- Billy swims the next 3 laps in 4 minutes, which is \\(4 \\times 60 = 240\\) seconds.\n- Billy swims the next lap in 1 minute, which is \\(1 \\times 60 = 60\\) seconds.\n- Margaret finishes all 10 laps in 10 minutes, which is \\(10 \\times 60 = 600\\) seconds.\n- Billy wins the competition by finishing 30 seconds before Margaret, so Billy's total time is \\(600 - 30 = 570\\) seconds.\n\nNext, we add up the time Billy spent on the first 9 laps:\n\\[120 + 240 + 60 = 420\\] seconds.\n\nTo find out how long it took Billy to swim his final lap, we subtract the time he spent on the first 9 laps from his total time:\n\\[570 - 420 = 150\\] seconds.\n\nTherefore, it took Billy \\(\\boxed{150}\\) seconds to swim his final lap.",

        "To determine how long it took Billy to swim his final lap, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time Billy took to swim the first 9 laps.\n2. Determine the total time Billy took to swim all 10 laps.\n3. Subtract the time taken for the first 9 laps from the total time to find the time taken for the final lap.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Billy took for each segment of his swim:\n- Billy swims the first 5 laps in 2 minutes.\n- Billy swims the next 3 laps in 4 minutes.\n- Billy swims the next lap in 1 minute.\n\nConvert these times to seconds for easier calculation:\n- 2 minutes = \\(2 \\times 60 = 120\\) seconds.\n- 4 minutes = \\(4 \\times 60 = 240\\) seconds.\n- 1 minute = \\(1 \\times 60 = 60\\) seconds.\n\nNext, sum the times for the first 9 laps:\n\\[\n120 \\text{ seconds} + 240 \\text{ seconds} + 60 \\text{ seconds} = 420 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n Margaret finishes swimming all 10 laps in 10 minutes. Convert this time to seconds:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ minutes} = 10 \\times 60 = 600 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nBilly wins the competition by finishing his laps 30 seconds before Margaret. Therefore, the total time Billy took to swim all 10 laps is:\n\\[\n600 \\text{ seconds} - 30 \\text{ seconds} = 570 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nFinally, subtract the time taken for the first 9 laps from the total time to find the time taken for the final lap:\n\\[\n570 \\text{ seconds} - 420 \\text{ seconds} = 150 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nThus, it took Billy \\(\\boxed{150}\\) seconds to swim his final lap.",
