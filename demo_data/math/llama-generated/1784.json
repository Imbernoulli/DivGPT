The area \\(A_{\\text{wall}}\\) is given by:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{wall}} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 5 \\, \\text{ft} \\times 10 \\, \\text{ft} = 50 \\, \\text{square feet}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the ratio of the area of the painting to the area of the wall.**\n\nThe ratio \\(R\\) is given by:\n\\[\nR = \\frac{A_{\\text{painting}}}{A_{\\text{wall}}} = \\frac{8 \\, \\text{square feet}}{50 \\, \\text{square feet}} = \\frac{8}{50} = \\frac{4}{25}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Convert this ratio to a percentage.**\n\nTo convert the ratio to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = R \\times 100 = \\frac{4}{25} \\times 100 = 16\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the wall that is taken up by the painting is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
        "To determine what percentage of the wall is taken up by the painting, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the area of the painting.\n2. Calculate the area of the wall.\n3. Determine the ratio of the area of the painting to the area of the wall.\n4. Convert this ratio to a percentage.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the painting. The painting is 2 feet by 4 feet, so its area is:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ feet} \\times 4 \\text{ feet} = 8 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the area of the wall. The wall is 5 feet by 10 feet, so its area is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ feet} \\times 10 \\text{ feet} = 50 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the area of the painting to the area of the wall. This ratio is:\n\\[\n\\frac{8 \\text{ square feet}}{50 \\text{ square feet}} = \\frac{8}{50} = \\frac{4}{25}\n\\]\n\nTo convert this ratio to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{25} \\times 100 = 16\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the wall that is taken up by the painting is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]",
