        "To determine the number of supplies remaining on the ship, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the amount of food used and remaining at each step.\n\n1. **Initial Supply:**\n   The ship starts with 400 pounds of food.\n\n2. **Food Used After One Day:**\n   The sailors use \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the initial supply.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Food used after one day} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 400 = \\frac{2 \\times 400}{5} = 160 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the remaining food after one day is:\n   \\[\n   400 - 160 = 240 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Food Used After the Next Two Days:**\n   The sailors use \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of the remaining food after the first day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Food used after the next two days} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 240 = \\frac{3 \\times 240}{5} = 144 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the remaining food after the next two days is:\n   \\[\n   240 - 144 = 96 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of supplies remaining in the ship to last the sailors until they dock is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
        "Let's start by calculating the amount of food used after the first day. The ship initially has 400 pounds of food. After one day, 2/5 of the supplies have been used.
