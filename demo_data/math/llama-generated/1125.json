        "To determine how much money Todd has left after buying the candy bars, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the candy bars.\n2. Subtract the total cost from Todd's initial amount of money.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the candy bars. Todd buys 4 candy bars, and each candy bar costs $2. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ candy bars} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per candy bar} = \\$8 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost of the candy bars from Todd's initial amount of money. Todd initially has $20. After spending $8 on candy bars, the amount of money he has left is:\n\\[ \\$20 - \\$8 = \\$12 \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money Todd has left is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
