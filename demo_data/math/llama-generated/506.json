        "To determine the length of each side of the square that Tony can make from his piece of quilt, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the area of the original quilt.\n2. Set the area of the square equal to the area of the original quilt.\n3. Solve for the side length of the square.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the original quilt. The quilt is a rectangle with a length of 24 feet and a width of 6 feet. The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[ A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\]\nSubstituting the given dimensions:\n\\[ A = 24 \\times 6 = 144 \\text{ square feet} \\]\n\nNext, we know that the area of the square will be the same as the area of the original quilt. Let \\( s \\) be the length of each side of the square. The area \\( A \\) of a square is given by the formula:\n\\[ A = s^2 \\]\nSince the area of the square is 144 square feet, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ s^2 = 144 \\]\n\nTo find \\( s \\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{144} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of each side of the square is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) feet.",

Let \\( s \\) be the side length of the square. The area \\( A \\) of a square is given by the formula:\n\\[ A = s^2 \\]\nSubstituting the area of the square:\n\\[ 144 = s^2 \\]\nTo find \\( s \\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{144} = 12 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of each side of the square is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
