        "To determine how many clovers in the field are both purple and four-leaved, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of four-leaved clovers.\n2. Determine the number of purple four-leaved clovers.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of four-leaved clovers.**\n\nWe know that 20% of the 500 clovers have four leaves. So, we multiply 500 by 20% (or 0.20):\n\n\\[ 500 \\times 0.20 = 100 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 100 four-leaved clovers.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of purple four-leaved clovers.**\n\nWe know that one quarter of the four-leaved clovers are purple. So, we multiply 100 by one quarter (or 0.25):\n\n\\[ 100 \\times 0.25 = 25 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 25 purple four-leaved clovers.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",

Determine the number of purple clovers among the four-leaved clovers.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of four-leaved clovers. Since 20% of the 500 clovers have four leaves, we can find this number by multiplying 500 by 20% (or 0.20):\n\\[\n500 \\times 0.20 = 100\n\\]\nSo, there are 100 four-leaved clovers in the field.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these four-leaved clovers are purple. We know that one quarter of the four-leaved clovers are purple. Therefore, we multiply the number of four-leaved clovers by 1 quarter (or 0.25):\n\\[\n100 \\times 0.25 = 25\n\\]\nSo, there are 25 clovers in the field that are both purple and four-leaved.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{25}\n\\]",
