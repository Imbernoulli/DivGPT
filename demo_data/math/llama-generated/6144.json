        "To determine the price of one of the other pieces of clothing, we start by calculating the total cost of the two pieces of clothing that we know the prices of. The first piece costs $49 and the second piece costs $81. Adding these together, we get:\n\n\\[49 + 81 = 130\\]\n\nNext, we subtract this total from the overall amount spent on all 7 pieces of clothing to find out how much was spent on the remaining 5 pieces.

The total cost of all seven pieces is $610. So, we perform the following subtraction:\n\n\\[610 - 130 = 480\\]\n\nSince the other five pieces of clothing are all the same price, we divide the total cost of these five pieces by 5 to find the price of one piece:\n\n\\[480 \\div 5 = 96\\]\n\nTherefore, the price of one of the other pieces is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
        "To find out how much one of the other pieces of clothing cost, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total cost of the two known pieces:**\n   - One piece costs $49.\n   - Another piece costs $81.\n   \\[\n   49 + 81 = 130\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the total cost of the two known pieces from the total amount spent:**\n   - Jangshe spent a total of $610.\n   - The total cost of the two known pieces is $130.\n   \\[\n   610 - 130 = 480\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many pieces remain:**\n   - Jangshe bought a total of 7 pieces.\n   - Two pieces are already known.\n   \\[\n   7 - 2 = 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the cost of one of the remaining pieces:**\n   - The total cost of the remaining 5 pieces is $480.\n   - Since all the remaining pieces are the same price, divide $480 by 5.\n   \\[\n   480 \\div 5 = 96\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of one of the other pieces is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
        "To determine the price of one of the other pieces of clothing, we start by identifying the total amount Jangshe spent and the costs of the two specific pieces. Jangshe spent a total of $610 on 7 pieces of clothing. One piece cost $49 and another piece cost $81. Let's calculate the combined cost of these two pieces:\n\n\\[49 + 81 = 130\\]\n\nThis means that the total cost of the remaining 5 pieces of clothing is:\n\n\\[610 - 130 = 480\\]\n\nSince the other 5 pieces of clothing were all the same price, we can find the price of one of these pieces by dividing the total cost of the remaining pieces by 5:\n\n\\[480 \\div 5 = 96\\]\n\nTherefore, the price of one of the other pieces of clothing is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
