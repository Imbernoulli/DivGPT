        "To determine how much money Darwin has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much Darwin spent on gas.\n2. Determine how much money he has left after buying gas.\n3. Calculate how much Darwin spent on food.\n4. Determine how much money he has left after buying food.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate how much Darwin spent on gas:\n   Darwin spent \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of his $600 on gas.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 600 = 200\n   \\]\n   So, Darwin spent $200 on gas.\n\n2. Determine how much money he has left after buying gas:\n   Subtract the amount spent on gas from the initial amount of money.\n   \\[\n   600 - 200 = 400\n   \\]\n   So, Darwin has $400 left after buying gas.\n\n3. Calculate how much Darwin spent on food:\n   Darwin spent \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the remaining $400 on food.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 400 = 100\n   \\]\n   So, Darwin spent $100 on food.\n\n4. Determine how much money he has left after buying food:\n   Subtract the amount spent on food from the remaining amount of money.\n   \\[\n   400 - 100 = 300\n   \\]\n   So, Darwin has $300 left after buying food.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Darwin has left is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",

Determine how much money is left after buying food:\n   Subtract the amount spent on food from the remaining money.\n   \\[\n   400 - 100 = 300\n   \\]\n   So, Darwin has $300 left after buying food.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Darwin has left is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
        "To determine how much money Darwin has left after his expenditures, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much money Darwin spent on gas.\n2.
