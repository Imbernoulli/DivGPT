        "To determine the total amount of money needed, we start by calculating the cost for one student. Each student gets 1 candy bar and 2 bags of chips. The cost of one candy bar is $2, and the cost of one bag of chips is $0.50. Therefore, the cost for 2 bags of chips is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.50 = 1 \\text{ dollar} \\]\n\nAdding the cost of the candy bar and the cost of the chips gives us the total cost for one student:\n\n\\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince there are 5 students, we multiply the total cost for one student by 5:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money needed is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]",
