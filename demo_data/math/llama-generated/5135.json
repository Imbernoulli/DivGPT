        "To determine how many popsicle sticks Danielle will be left with after making as many popsicles as she can, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the molds and popsicle sticks.\n2. Determine how much money is left after buying the molds and popsicle sticks.\n3. Calculate how many bottles of juice she can buy with the remaining money.\n4. Determine the total number of popsicles she can make.\n5. Calculate how many popsicle sticks will be left.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the molds and popsicle sticks:\n- The cost of the molds is $3.\n- The cost of the popsicle sticks is $1.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the molds and popsicle sticks is $3 + $1 = $4.\n\nNext, let's determine how much money is left after buying the molds and popsicle sticks:\n- Danielle started with $10.\n- After spending $4 on the molds and popsicle sticks, she has $10 - $4 = $6 left.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many bottles of juice she can buy with the remaining $6:\n- Each bottle of juice costs $2.\n- Therefore, the number of bottles of juice she can buy is $6 / $2 = 3.\n\nNext, let's determine the total number of popsicles she can make:\n- Each bottle of juice makes 20 popsicles.\n- Since she can buy 3 bottles of juice, the total number of popsicles she can make is 3 * 20 = 60.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how many popsicle sticks will be left:\n- She bought 100 popsicle sticks.\n- She used 60 popsicle sticks to make the popsicles.\n- Therefore, the number of popsicle sticks left is 100 - 60 = 40.\n\nThe number of popsicle sticks Danielle will be left with is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
