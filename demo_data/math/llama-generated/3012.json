        "To determine the total number of bird eggs June found, we need to add up the eggs from each nest. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of eggs in the first tree:\n   - June found 2 nests with 5 eggs each.\n   - So, \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) eggs.\n\n2. Calculate the number of eggs in the second tree:\n   - June found 1 nest with 3 eggs.\n   - So, \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\) eggs.\n\n3. Calculate the number of eggs in her front yard:\n   - June found 1 nest with 4 eggs.\n   - So, \\(1 \\times 4 = 4\\) eggs.\n\n4. Add up all the eggs from the three locations:\n   - Eggs in the first tree: 10\n   - Eggs in the second tree: 3\n   - Eggs in the front yard: 4\n   - So, \\(10 + 3 + 4 = 17\\) eggs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of bird eggs June found is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",
