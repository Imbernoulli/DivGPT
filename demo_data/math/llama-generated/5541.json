Identify which of the four buckets Darius pours into the bigger bucket along with the ten-ounce bucket to make a total of 23 ounces.\n2. Determine the total amount of water in the remaining three buckets and pour them into the second large bucket.\n\nFirst, let's find out which bucket Darius pours into the bigger bucket with the ten-ounce bucket. We know the total in the bigger bucket is 23 ounces. So, we need to find a bucket whose amount of water, when added to 10 ounces, equals 23 ounces. We can set up the equation:\n\n\\[10 + x = 23\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[x = 23 - 10 = 13\\]\n\nSo, Darius pours the 13-ounce bucket into the bigger bucket along with the 10-ounce bucket. Now, we need to determine the total amount of water in the remaining three buckets: 11 ounces, 12 ounces, and 16 ounces. We add these amounts together:\n\n\\[11 + 12 + 16 = 39\\]\n\nTherefore, the second large bucket contains \\(\\boxed{39}\\) ounces.",

Since we already used the 10-ounce and 13-ounce buckets, the remaining buckets are 11 ounces, 12 ounces, and 16 ounces.\n\nNow, we calculate the sum of these three remaining buckets:\n\n\\[ 11 + 12 + 16 \\]\n\nAdding these together step by step:\n\n\\[ 11 + 12 = 23 \\]\n\\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \\]\n\nSo, the total weight in the second large bucket is:\n\n\\[ 39 \\]\n\nTherefore, the second large bucket contains \\(\\boxed{39}\\) ounces.",
        "To determine how many ounces the second large bucket contains, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify which bucket Darius poured into the bigger bucket along with the ten-ounce bucket to get a total of 23 ounces.\n2. Calculate the total amount of water in the second large bucket by adding the remaining three buckets.\n\nFirst, let's find out which bucket Darius poured into the bigger bucket along with the ten-ounce bucket. We know the total in the bigger bucket is 23 ounces. So, we need to find a bucket that, when added to 10 ounces, equals 23 ounces. We can set up the equation:\n\\[ 10 + x = 23 \\]\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ x = 13 \\]\nSo, Darius poured the 13-ounce bucket into the bigger bucket along with the ten-ounce bucket. Now, we know the contents of the bigger bucket are 10 ounces and 13 ounces, which adds up to 23 ounces.\n\nNext, we need to determine which buckets are left. The original buckets were 11 ounces, 13 ounces, 12 ounces, 16 ounces, and 10 ounces. Since the 13-ounce bucket and the 10-ounce bucket have been poured into the bigger bucket, the remaining buckets are 11 ounces, 12 ounces, and 16 ounces.\n\nNow, we add the remaining three buckets together to find out how many ounces the second large bucket contains:\n\\[ 11 + 12 + 16 = 39 \\]\n\nTherefore, the second large bucket contains \\(\\boxed{39}\\) ounces.",
        "To solve the problem, we need to determine which of the four buckets Darius poured into the bigger bucket along with the ten-ounce bucket to get a total of 23 ounces. Let's denote the amount of water in the four buckets as follows: 11 ounces, 13 ounces, 12 ounces, and 16 ounces.\n\nWe know that when Darius pours the ten-ounce bucket into the bigger bucket along with one of these four buckets, the total is 23 ounces. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[10 + x = 23\\]\n\nwhere \\(x\\) is the amount of water in the bucket he poured into the bigger bucket. To find \\(x\\), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[x = 23 - 10\\]\n\\[x = 13\\]\n\nSo, Darius poured the 13-ounce bucket into the bigger bucket along with the 10-ounce bucket. The remaining three buckets are 11 ounces, 12 ounces, and 16 ounces. He pours these three buckets into a second large bucket. To find out how many ounces are in the second large bucket, we add the amounts of water in these three buckets:\n\n\\[11 + 12 + 16 = 39\\]\n\nTherefore, the second large bucket contains \\(\\boxed{39}\\) ounces.",
