        "To determine how many balloons remain intact in the hot air balloon, we can break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of balloons blown up in the first half hour:**\n   The problem states that after about half an hour, \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the total number of balloons have blown up. Since the total number of balloons is 200, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times 200 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, 40 balloons have blown up after the first half hour.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of balloons blown up in the next hour:**\n   After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. Since 40 balloons had already blown up, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 40 = 80\n   \\]\n   So, 80 more balloons blow up in the next hour.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of balloons blown up:**\n   The total number of balloons blown up is the sum of the balloons blown up in the first half hour and the balloons blown up in the next hour:\n   \\[\n   40 + 80 = 120\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of balloons remaining intact:**\n   The number of balloons remaining intact is the total number of balloons minus the total number of balloons blown up:\n   \\[\n   200 - 120 = 80\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of balloons in the hot air balloon that remain intact is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
        "Let's start by determining how many balloons have blown up after half an hour. The problem states that after half an hour, \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the total number of balloons have blown up. Since the total number of balloons is 200, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times 200 = 40\n\\]\n\nSo, after half an hour, 40 balloons have blown up. Next, we need to find out how many balloons have blown up after another hour. According to the problem, after another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. Since 40 balloons had already blown up, twice that number is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 40 = 80\n\\]\n\nTherefore, after another hour, an additional 80 balloons blow up. To find the total number of balloons that have blown up after this additional hour, we add the number of balloons that blown up after half an hour to the number that blew up after another hour:\n\n\\[\n40 + 80 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, after another hour, 120 balloons have blown up in total. To find out how many balloons remain intact, we subtract the total number of blown up balloons from the original number of balloons:\n\n\\[\n200 - 120 = 80\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of balloons in the hot air balloon that remain intact is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{80}\n\\]",
