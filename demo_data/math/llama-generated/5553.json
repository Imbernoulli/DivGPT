So, the time spent in this class is:\n  \\[\n  1 \\times 4 = 4 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n- Adding these together, the total time spent in classes each week is:\n  \\[\n  6 + 4 = 10 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's add the time David spends working on small group homework assignments each week:\n- David spends 4 hours each week on homework assignments. So, the total time spent on homework assignments each week is:\n  \\[\n  10 + 4 = 14 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of hours spent on the course over the entire 24-week period:\n- Since David spends 14 hours each week on the course, the total time spent over 24 weeks is:\n  \\[\n  14 \\times 24 = 336 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours David will spend on the course is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{336}\n\\]",
