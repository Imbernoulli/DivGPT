Therefore, we can calculate Helen's height by adding 3 cm to Amy's height:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Helen's height} = 150 \\text{ cm} + 3 \\text{ cm} = 153 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n3. Angela is 4 cm taller than Helen. Therefore, we can calculate Angela's height by adding 4 cm to Helen's height:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Angela's height} = 153 \\text{ cm} + 4 \\text{ cm} = 157 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Angela is \\(\\boxed{157}\\) cm tall.",
        "To determine Angela's height, we start with the height of Amy and use the given relationships between the heights of Angela, Helen, and Amy.\n\n1. We know Amy's height is 150 cm.\n2. Helen is 3 cm taller than Amy. Therefore, we can calculate Helen's height as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Helen's height} = \\text{Amy's height} + 3 = 150 + 3 = 153 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n3. Angela is 4 cm taller than Helen. Therefore, we can calculate Angela's height as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Angela's height} = \\text{Helen's height} + 4 = 153 + 4 = 157 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Angela is \\boxed{157} cm tall.",
