        "To determine the total cost of James's new pair of glasses after applying the insurance coverage and the coupon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the lenses after insurance coverage.\n2. Calculate the cost of the frames after applying the coupon.\n3. Add the two amounts together to get the total cost.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the lenses after insurance coverage.**\n\nThe original cost of the lenses is $500. Insurance will cover 80% of this cost. Therefore, James needs to pay 20% of the cost of the lenses.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of lenses after insurance} = 500 \\times (1 - 0.80) = 500 \\times 0.20 = 100\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the frames after applying the coupon.**\n\nThe original cost of the frames is $200. James has a $50 off coupon for the frames. Therefore, he needs to subtract $50 from the original cost.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of frames after coupon} = 200 - 50 = 150\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the two amounts together to get the total cost.**\n\nNow, we add the cost of the lenses after insurance and the cost of the frames after the coupon.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 100 + 150 = 250\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost of everything is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",
