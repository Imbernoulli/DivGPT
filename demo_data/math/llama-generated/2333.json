We start by adding the number of students who gave each of these answers:\n\n- Students who liked oranges: 70\n- Students who liked pears: 120\n- Students who liked apples: 147\n\nAdding these together, we get:\n\\[ 70 + 120 + 147 = 337 \\]\n\nThis means that 337 students chose either oranges, pears, or apples. Since Sarah interviewed a total of 450 students, the number of students who picked strawberries is the total number of students minus the number who picked oranges, pears, or apples:\n\\[ 450 - 337 = 113 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students who picked strawberries as their favorite fruit is \\(\\boxed{113}\\).",
