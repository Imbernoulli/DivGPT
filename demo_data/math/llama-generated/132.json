        "To determine how much money the housewife has left after spending 2/3 of her $150, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much money she spent.\n2. Subtract the amount spent from the original amount of money she had.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of money she spent. She spent 2/3 of $150, so we multiply $150 by 2/3:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount spent} = 150 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 150 \\times 0.6667 = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount spent from the original amount of money she had:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount left} = 150 - 100 = 50\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the housewife has \\boxed{50} dollars left.",
