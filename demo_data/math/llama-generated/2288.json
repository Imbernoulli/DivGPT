        "To determine the total number of pastries that Calvin, Phoebe, Frank, and Grace have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many pastries Frank has.\n2. Determine how many pastries Calvin and Phoebe each have.\n3. Add up the pastries of Calvin, Phoebe, Frank, and Grace.\n\nFirst, we know that Grace has 30 pastries. According to the problem, Calvin and Phoebe each have five less pastries than Grace. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pastries Calvin and Phoebe each have as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pastries Calvin has} = 30 - 5 = 25\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pastries Phoebe has} = 30 - 5 = 25\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Calvin and Phoebe each have 8 more pastries than Frank.

Now, we sum up the pastries that Calvin, Phoebe, Frank, and Grace have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of pastries} = \\text{Number of pastries Calvin has} + \\text{Number of pastries Phoebe has} + \\text{Number of pastries Frank has} + \\text{Number of pastries Grace has}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of pastries} = 25 + 25 + 17 + 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of pastries} = 97\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pastries that the four have is \\(\\boxed{97}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of pastries that Calvin, Phoebe, Frank, and Grace have, we need to find out how many pastries each person has and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we know that Grace has 30 pastries. According to the problem, Calvin and Phoebe each have 5 less pastries than Grace.
