Ben caught 4 fish, his wife Judy caught 1 fish, his oldest son Billy caught 3, his younger son Jim caught 2, and his youngest child Susie surprised them all by catching 5! Unfortunately, 3 of the fish were too small, so they threw them back. If each fish will give them 2 filets, how many fish filets will Ben and his family have?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total number of fish filets Ben and his family will have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of fish caught:**\n   - Ben caught 4 fish.\n   - Judy caught 1 fish.\n   - Billy caught 3 fish.\n   - Jim caught 2 fish.\n   - Susie caught 5 fish.\n\n   Adding these together:\n   \\[\n   4 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of fish kept:**\n   - They threw back 3 fish.\n   - Therefore, the number of fish they kept is:\n   \\[\n   15 - 3 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of fish filets:**\n   - Each fish gives them 2 filets.\n   - Therefore, the total number of filets is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 2 = 24\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of fish filets Ben and his family will have is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
