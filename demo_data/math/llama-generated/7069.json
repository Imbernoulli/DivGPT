        "To determine the total cost of fixing James's shirts and pants, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time required to fix all the shirts.\n2. Calculate the total time required to fix all the pants.\n3. Add the times from steps 1 and 2 to get the total time required.\n4. Calculate the total cost by multiplying the total time by the hourly rate.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time required to fix all the shirts. James has 10 shirts, and it takes 1.5 hours to fix each shirt. Therefore, the total time for the shirts is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ shirts} \\times 1.5 \\text{ hours/shirt} = 15 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time required to fix all the pants. James has 12 pairs of pants, and it takes twice as long to fix each pair of pants as it does to fix a shirt. Since it takes 1.5 hours to fix a shirt, it takes \\( 1.5 \\times 2 = 3 \\) hours to fix each pair of pants. Therefore, the total time for the pants is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ pairs of pants} \\times 3 \\text{ hours/pair} = 36 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we add the total time for the shirts and the total time for the pants to get the total time required:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ hours} + 36 \\text{ hours} = 51 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the total time by the hourly rate. The tailor charges $30 per hour, so the total cost is:\n\\[ 51 \\text{ hours} \\times 30 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 1530 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1530} \\]",
