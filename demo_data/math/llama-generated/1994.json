        "To determine the number of cherry sodas in the cooler, we start by defining variables for the quantities of each type of soda. Let's denote the number of cherry sodas by \\( c \\). According to the problem, there are twice as many cans of orange pop as there are of cherry soda. Therefore, the number of cans of orange pop can be expressed as \\( 2c \\).\n\nThe total number of cans in the cooler is given as 24. This total is the sum of the number of cherry sodas and the number of orange pops. We can write this relationship as:\n\\[ c + 2c = 24 \\]\n\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 3c = 24 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( c \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ c = \\frac{24}{3} = 8 \\]\n\nThus, the number of cherry sodas is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

        "Let's define the number of cherry sodas as \\( c \\) and the number of orange pops as \\( o \\). According to the problem, the total number of cans in the cooler is 24, and there are twice as many cans of orange pop as there are of cherry soda. We can express these relationships with the following equations:\n\n1. \\( c + o = 24 \\)\n2. \\( o = 2c \\)\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \\( o \\):\n\n\\[ c + 2c = 24 \\]\n\nCombining like terms gives us:\n\n\\[ 3c = 24 \\]\n\nTo find \\( c \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{24}{3} = 8 \\]\n\nSo, there are \\( 8 \\) cherry sodas. To verify, we can calculate the number of orange pops:\n\n\\[ o = 2c = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\n\nAdding the number of cherry sodas and orange pops together gives:\n\n\\[ c + o = 8 + 16 = 24 \\]\n\nThis confirms that our solution is correct. Therefore, the number of cherry sodas is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."
