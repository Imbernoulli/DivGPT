        "To determine how many cherry tomatoes are left on the tomato plant after the birds eat some, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of cherry tomatoes initially on the plant.\n2. Calculate how many tomatoes the birds eat.\n3. Subtract the number of tomatoes eaten by the birds from the initial total.\n\nFirst, we know there are 21 cherry tomatoes on the plant. The problem states that 2 birds eat one-third of the tomatoes. To find out how many tomatoes the birds eat, we calculate one-third of 21:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 21 = 7\n\\]\n\nSo, the birds eat 7 tomatoes. To find out how many tomatoes are left on the plant, we subtract the number of tomatoes eaten by the birds from the initial total:\n\n\\[\n21 - 7 = 14\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cherry tomatoes still left on the tomato plant is \\boxed{14}.",
