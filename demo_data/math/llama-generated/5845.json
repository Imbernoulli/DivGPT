        "To determine the total amount Selene and Tanya spend together, we need to calculate the cost of their individual purchases and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of Selene's purchases:\n- Selene buys three sandwiches. Each sandwich costs $2.\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 2 = 6\n  \\]\n- Selene also buys one can of fruit juice. Each can of fruit juice costs $2.\n  \\[\n  1 \\times 2 = 2\n  \\]\n- Adding these amounts together gives the total cost for Selene:\n  \\[\n  6 + 2 = 8\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of Tanya's purchases:\n- Tanya buys two hamburgers. Each hamburger costs $2.\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 2 = 4\n  \\]\n- Tanya also buys two cans of fruit juice. Each can of fruit juice costs $2.\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 2 = 4\n  \\]\n- Adding these amounts together gives the total cost for Tanya:\n  \\[\n  4 + 4 = 8\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the total costs for Selene and Tanya:\n\\[\n8 + 8 = 16\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount Selene and Tanya spend together is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
