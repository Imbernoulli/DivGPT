        "To determine how much money Maria needs to earn to buy the bike, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total cost of the bike.\n2. Determine how much Maria has already saved.\n3. Determine how much her mother has offered.\n4. Calculate the remaining amount Maria needs to earn.\n\nThe total cost of the bike is $600.
