        "To determine how many jellybeans each nephew or niece receives, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of children Aunt Angela has.\n2. Divide the total number of jellybeans by the total number of children.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of children. Aunt Angela has 3 nephews and 2 nieces. Therefore, the total number of children is:\n\\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of jellybeans by the total number of children. Aunt Angela has 70 jellybeans, so we divide 70 by 5:\n\\[ 70 \\div 5 = 14 \\]\n\nThus, each nephew or niece receives \\(\\boxed{14}\\) jellybeans.",
