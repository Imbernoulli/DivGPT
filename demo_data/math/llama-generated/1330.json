        "To determine the total time it will take John to watch all the episodes of the TV show after the last season finishes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of episodes in the first 9 seasons.\n2. Calculate the number of episodes in the last season.\n3. Add the number of episodes from the first 9 seasons and the last season.\n4. Convert the total number of episodes into hours.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of episodes in the first 9 seasons.**\n\nEach of the first 9 seasons has 22 episodes. Therefore, the total number of episodes in the first 9 seasons is:\n\\[ 9 \\times 22 = 198 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of episodes in the last season.**\n\nThe last season has 4 episodes longer than each of the other seasons. Since each season has 22 episodes, the last season has:\n\\[ 22 + 4 = 26 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the number of episodes from the first 9 seasons and the last season.**\n\nThe total number of episodes in all 10 seasons is:\n\\[ 198 + 26 = 224 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Convert the total number of episodes into hours.**\n\nEach episode is 0.5 hours long. Therefore, the total time to watch all the episodes is:\n\\[ 224 \\times 0.5 = 112 \\]\n\nSo, the total time it will take John to watch all the episodes after the last season finishes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{112} \\]",

        "To determine the total time it will take John to watch all the episodes after the last season finishes, we need to calculate the number of episodes in each season and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of episodes in the first 9 seasons. Each of these seasons has 22 episodes. Therefore, the total number of episodes in the first 9 seasons is:\n\\[ 9 \\times 22 = 198 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of episodes in the last season. The last season has 4 episodes more than the other seasons.
