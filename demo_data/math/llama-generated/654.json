        "To determine the total number of fish that Bobby, Sarah, Tony, and Billy have together, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of fish Billy has.\n2. Use Billy's number of fish to find out how many fish Tony has.\n3. Use Tony's number of fish to find out how many fish Sarah has.\n4. Use Sarah's number of fish to find out how many fish Bobby has.\n5. Add up the number of fish each person has.\n\nFirst, we know that Billy has 10 fish. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Billy's fish} = 10 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Tony has 3 times as many fish as Billy. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Tony's fish} = 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Sarah has 5 more fish than Tony. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Sarah's fish} = 30 + 5 = 35 \\]\n\nFinally, we know that Bobby has twice as many fish as Sarah. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Bobby's fish} = 2 \\times 35 = 70 \\]\n\nNow, we add up the number of fish each person has:\n\\[ \\text{Total fish} = \\text{Billy's fish} + \\text{Tony's fish} + \\text{Sarah's fish} + \\text{Bobby's fish} = 10 + 30 + 35 + 70 = 145 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of fish that all 4 people have put together is:\n\\[ \\boxed{145} \\]",
