        "To determine how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many apples Caleb picked.\n2. Find out how many apples Suraya picked.\n3. Calculate the difference between the number of apples Suraya picked and the number of apples Kayla picked.\n\nFirst, we know that Kayla picked 20 apples. According to the problem, Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla. Therefore, we can calculate the number of apples Caleb picked as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Caleb's apples} = 20 - 5 = 15 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb. Therefore, we can calculate the number of apples Suraya picked as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Suraya's apples} = 15 + 12 = 27 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Kayla picked from the number of apples Suraya picked:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 27 - 20 = 7 \\]\n\nThus, Suraya picked \\(\\boxed{7}\\) more apples than Kayla.",
