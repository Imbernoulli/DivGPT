His horse runs at 20 feet per second, and a bullet fired from his gun flies at a speed of 400 feet per second.  But if he fires a gun while riding his horse, and the gun is aimed in the same direction that the horse is running, how much faster, in feet per second, is the bullet flying than if he fires the bullet in the opposite direction of what the horse was running?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To solve the problem, we need to consider the relative speeds of the bullet when Wild Bill fires it in the same direction as the horse and in the opposite direction.\n\n1. **Speed of the bullet when fired in the same direction as the horse:**\n   - The speed of the horse is 20 feet per second.\n   - The speed of the bullet relative to the ground when fired in the same direction as the horse is the sum of the speed of the bullet and the speed of the horse.\n   - Therefore, the speed of the bullet is \\(400 + 20 = 420\\) feet per second.\n\n2. **Speed of the bullet when fired in the opposite direction of the horse:**\n   - The speed of the horse is 20 feet per second.\n   - The speed of the bullet relative to the ground when fired in the opposite direction of the horse is the difference between the speed of the bullet and the speed of the horse.\n   - Therefore, the speed of the bullet is \\(400 - 20 = 380\\) feet per second.\n\n3. **Difference in speed between the two scenarios:**\n   - The speed of the bullet when fired in the same direction as the horse is 420 feet per second.\n   - The speed of the bullet when fired in the opposite direction of the horse is 380 feet per second.\n   - The difference in speed is \\(420 - 380 = 40\\) feet per second.\n\nThus, the bullet is flying \\(\\boxed{40}\\) feet per second faster when fired in the same direction as the horse than when fired in the opposite direction.",
