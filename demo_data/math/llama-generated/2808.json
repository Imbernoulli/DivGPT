        "To determine how many friends receive a candy necklace, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pieces of candy Jan gets from breaking down the blocks.\n2. Determine how many pieces of candy are needed for each candy necklace.\n3. Calculate how many candy necklaces can be made with the total number of pieces of candy.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pieces of candy Jan gets from breaking down the blocks. Since each block produces 30 pieces of candy and Jan breaks down 3 blocks, we multiply the number of blocks by the number of pieces each block produces:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ blocks} \\times 30 \\text{ pieces/block} = 90 \\text{ pieces of candy} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many pieces of candy are needed for each candy necklace. Each candy necklace is made up of 10 pieces of candy.\n\nNow, we calculate how many candy necklaces can be made with the total number of pieces of candy. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces of candy by the number of pieces needed for each candy necklace:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ pieces of candy} \\div 10 \\text{ pieces/necklace} = 9 \\text{ candy necklaces} \\]\n\nSince Jan is making candy necklaces for herself and a few friends, and the total number of candy necklaces is 9, the number of friends who receive a candy necklace is:\n\\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of friends who receive a candy necklace is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

Subtract 1 from the total number of candy necklaces to find out how many friends receive a candy necklace (since Jan keeps one for herself).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pieces of candy Jan has after breaking down the blocks. Since each block produces 30 pieces of candy and Jan breaks down 3 blocks, we have:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ pieces/block} \\times 3 \\text{ blocks} = 90 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many candy necklaces can be made with 90 pieces of candy. Since each candy necklace is made up of 10 pieces of candy, we have:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ pieces} \\div 10 \\text{ pieces/necklace} = 9 \\text{ necklaces} \\]\n\nSince Jan keeps one candy necklace for herself, the number of friends who receive a candy necklace is:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ necklaces} - 1 \\text{ necklace} = 8 \\text{ friends} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of friends who receive a candy necklace is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
