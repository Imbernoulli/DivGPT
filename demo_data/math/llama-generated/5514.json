        "To determine how many strawberries Hannah has by the end of April, we can break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of strawberries harvested in April:**\n   Hannah harvests 5 strawberries each day. Since April has 30 days, the total number of strawberries harvested is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ strawberries/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 150 \\text{ strawberries}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the number of strawberries given away:**\n   Hannah gives away 20 strawberries. So, we subtract 20 from the total number of strawberries harvested:\n   \\[\n   150 \\text{ strawberries} - 20 \\text{ strawberries} = 130 \\text{ strawberries}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the number of strawberries stolen:**\n   30 strawberries are stolen. So, we subtract 30 from the remaining number of strawberries:\n   \\[\n   130 \\text{ strawberries} - 30 \\text{ strawberries} = 100 \\text{ strawberries}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, by the end of April, Hannah has \\(\\boxed{100}\\) strawberries.",
