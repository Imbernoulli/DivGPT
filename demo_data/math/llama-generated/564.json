        "To determine how many bottles will not be placed in a crate, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bottles that can be packed into the crates.\n2. Subtract the number of bottles that can be packed from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles will not be placed in a crate.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of bottles that can be packed into the crates. Since each crate can hold 12 bottles and Joshua has 10 crates, the total number of bottles that can be packed is:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ bottles/crate} \\times 10 \\text{ crates} = 120 \\text{ bottles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of bottles that can be packed from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles will not be placed in a crate. Joshua has 130 bottles in total, so the number of bottles that will not be placed in a crate is:\n\\[\n130 \\text{ bottles} - 120 \\text{ bottles} = 10 \\text{ bottles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bottles that will not be placed in a crate is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
