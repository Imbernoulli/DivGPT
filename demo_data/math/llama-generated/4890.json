        "To determine the total number of spider legs in the group, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of legs a single spider has.\n2. Calculate half the number of legs a single spider has.\n3. Determine how many spiders are in the group.\n4. Calculate the total number of legs in the group.\n\nFirst, we know that a single spider has 8 legs.\n\nNext, we calculate half the number of legs a single spider has:\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{2} = 4\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that the group has 10 more spiders than half as many legs as a single spider has. Therefore, we add 10 to the number we just calculated:\n\\[\n4 + 10 = 14\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 14 spiders in the group.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of legs in the group by multiplying the number of spiders by the number of legs each spider has:\n\\[\n14 \\times 8 = 112\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of spider legs in the group is \\boxed{112}.",
