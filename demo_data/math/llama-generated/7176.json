        "To determine how many reams of paper John needs to buy over 12 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and then convert that into reams of paper.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pages John writes in short stories over 12 weeks. John writes 3 stories every week, and each story is 50 pages. Therefore, the number of pages he writes in short stories each week is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ stories/week} \\times 50 \\text{ pages/story} = 150 \\text{ pages/week} \\]\n\nOver 12 weeks, the total number of pages he writes in short stories is:\n\\[ 150 \\text{ pages/week} \\times 12 \\text{ weeks} = 1800 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the number of pages John writes in his novel. Since the novel is 1200 pages each year and we are only considering a 12-week period (which is approximately 3 months or 1/4 of a year), the number of pages he writes in the novel over 12 weeks is:\n\\[ 1200 \\text{ pages/year} \\times \\frac{12}{52} \\text{ weeks/year} = 1200 \\text{ pages/year} \\times \\frac{3}{13} \\text{ weeks/year} \\approx 276.92 \\text{ pages} \\]\nRounding to the nearest whole number, John writes approximately 277 pages of his novel over 12 weeks.\n\nNow, we add the pages from the short stories and the novel to get the total number of pages John writes over 12 weeks:\n\\[ 1800 \\text{ pages} + 277 \\text{ pages} = 2077 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nEach sheet of paper can hold 2 pages, so the total number of sheets of paper needed is:\n\\[ \\frac{2077 \\text{ pages}}{2 \\text{ pages/sheet}} = 1038.5 \\text{ sheets} \\]\nSince John can't buy half a sheet, we round up to the next whole number, which is 1039 sheets.\n\nEach ream of paper contains 500 sheets, so the number of reams needed is:\n\\[ \\frac{1039 \\text{ sheets}}{500 \\text{ sheets/ream}} = 2.078 \\]\nRounding up to the next whole number, John needs to buy 3 reams of paper.\n\nTherefore, the number of reams of paper John needs to buy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]",

Calculate the total number of pages John writes over 12 weeks:\n   \\[\n   1800 \\text{ pages} + 277 \\text{ pages} = 2077 \\text{ pages}\n   \\]\n5. Determine the number of sheets of paper needed. Since each sheet holds 2 pages:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2077 \\text{ pages}}{2 \\text{ pages/sheet}} = 1038.5 \\text{ sheets}\n   \\]\n   Again, since John cannot buy a fraction of a sheet, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 1039 sheets.\n6.
