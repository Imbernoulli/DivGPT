        "To determine how many yards Brendan can cut after a week with the help of his new lawnmower, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the increased cutting capacity per day:**\n   - Brendan originally cuts 8 yards per day.\n   - The lawnmower increases his cutting capacity by 50%.\n   - To find the increase, we multiply the original amount by 50% (or 0.50):\n     \\[\n     8 \\text{ yards/day} \\times 0.50 = 4 \\text{ yards/day}\n     \\]\n   - Adding this increase to the original amount:\n     \\[\n     8 \\text{ yards/day} + 4 \\text{ yards/day} = 12 \\text{ yards/day}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total yards cut in a week:**\n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - With the new capacity of 12 yards per day, we multiply the daily capacity by the number of days in a week:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ yards/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 84 \\text{ yards}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Brendan will be able to cut \\boxed{84} yards after a week.",

The lawnmower increases his cutting rate by 50%. To find the increase in yards per day, we multiply 8 by 50% (which is the same as 0.50):\n\n\\[ 8 \\times 0.50 = 4 \\text{ yards per day} \\]\n\nAdding this increase to his original rate gives:\n\n\\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \\text{ yards per day} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many yards he can cut in one week.**\n\nNow that Brendan cuts 12 yards per day, we need to find out how many yards he can cut in 7 days.

Determine the total amount of grass Brendan can cut in a week.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many yards Brendan can cut per day after buying the lawnmower. Brendan originally cuts 8 yards per day, and the lawnmower increases his cutting capacity by 50%. Therefore, the increase in the number of yards he can cut per day is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ yards/day} \\times 0.50 = 4 \\text{ yards/day} \\]\n\nAdding this increase to his original capacity, we get:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ yards/day} + 4 \\text{ yards/day} = 12 \\text{ yards/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many yards Brendan can cut in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of yards he can cut per day by 7:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ yards/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 84 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of yards Brendan will be able to cut after a week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{84} \\]",
        "To determine how many yards Brendan will be able to cut after a week with the help of his new lawnmower, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the new amount of grass Brendan can cut per day with the lawnmower.\n2. Determine the total amount of grass Brendan can cut in a week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the new amount of grass Brendan can cut per day. Brendan originally cuts 8 yards of grass per day. With the lawnmower, he can cut 50% more grass each day. Therefore, we need to find 50% of 8 yards and add it to the original 8 yards.\n\n\\[ 50\\% \\text{ of } 8 = 0.50 \\times 8 = 4 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nAdding this to the original amount:\n\n\\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \\text{ yards per day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total amount of grass Brendan can cut in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of yards he can cut per day by 7:\n\n\\[ 12 \\text{ yards per day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 84 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of yards Brendan will be able to cut after a week is \\(\\boxed{84}\\).",
