Therefore, we have:\n\\[ C_{\\text{Cool}} = 5 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Cat Cafe Paw has 2 times as many cats as Cat Cafe Cool. Let's denote the number of cats in Cat Cafe Paw as \\( C_{\\text{Paw}} \\). Therefore, we can express \\( C_{\\text{Paw}} \\) as:\n\\[ C_{\\text{Paw}} = 2 \\times C_{\\text{Cool}} \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( C_{\\text{Cool}} \\):\n\\[ C_{\\text{Paw}} = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Cat Cafe Meow has 3 times as many cats as Cat Cafe Paw. Let's denote the number of cats in Cat Cafe Meow as \\( C_{\\text{Meow}} \\). Therefore, we can express \\( C_{\\text{Meow}} \\) as:\n\\[ C_{\\text{Meow}} = 3 \\times C_{\\text{Paw}} \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( C_{\\text{Paw}} \\):\n\\[ C_{\\text{Meow}} = 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of cats in Cat Cafe Meow and Cat Cafe Paw. This is simply the sum of \\( C_{\\text{Meow}} \\) and \\( C_{\\text{Paw}} \\):\n\\[ C_{\\text{Meow}} + C_{\\text{Paw}} = 30 + 10 = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cats in Cat Cafe Meow and Cat Cafe Paw is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
