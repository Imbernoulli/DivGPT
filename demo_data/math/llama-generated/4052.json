        "To determine the total amount of time Hank spends reading in one week, we need to consider his reading hit on weekdays and weekends separately.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Hank spends reading the newspaper each week. He reads the newspaper for 30 minutes every morning, 5 days a week:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 150 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Hank spends reading the novel each week. He reads the novel for 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) every evening, 5 days a week:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 300 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, Hank doubles his reading time for both the newspaper and the novel. So, on each of these days, he reads the newspaper for \\( 30 \\times 2 = 60 \\) minutes and the novel for \\( 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\) minutes. Therefore, for the weekend, he spends:\n\\[ (60 \\text{ minutes} + 120 \\text{ minutes}) \\times 2 = 180 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 2 = 360 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we add the time spent reading on weekdays to the time spent reading on the weekend:\n\\[ 150 \\text{ minutes} + 300 \\text{ minutes} + 360 \\text{ minutes} = 810 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of time Hank spends reading in one week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{810} \\]",
        "To determine the total amount of time Hank spends reading in one week, we need to break down his reading schedule into manageable parts and then sum up the reading times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Hank spends reading the newspaper during the weekdays. He reads the newspaper for 30 minutes each day, 5 days a week:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Hank spends reading the novel during the weekdays. He reads the novel for 1 hour each day, 5 days a week. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we have:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 300 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the time Hank spends reading the newspaper on weekends. He doubles his reading time on Saturday and Sunday, so he reads the newspaper for:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 2 = 60 \\text{ minutes/day}\n\\]\nSince there are 2 days in the weekend, the total reading time for the weekend is:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Hank spends reading the novel on weekends. He doubles his reading time on Saturday and Sunday, so he reads the novel for:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 2 = 120 \\text{ minutes/day}\n\\]\nSince there are 2 days in the weekend, the total reading time for the weekend is:\n\\[\n120 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 240 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum up all the reading times for the weekdays and the weekends:\n\\[\n\\text{Weekday newspaper reading} + \\text{Weekday novel reading} + \\text{Weekend newspaper reading} + \\text{Weekend novel reading} = 150 \\text{ minutes} + 300 \\text{ minutes} + 120 \\text{ minutes} + 240 \\text{ minutes} = 810 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Hank spends reading in one week is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{810}\n\\]",
