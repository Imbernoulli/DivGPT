Therefore, the cost of the t-shirt is:\n\n\\[\n5 + 10 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that the jeans are twice the price of the t-shirt. Since the t-shirt costs $15, the cost of the jeans is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 15 = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, Henry needs to pay \\(\\boxed{30}\\) dollars for the pair of jeans.",
