        "To determine the percentage of blue flowers Madeline has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of flowers.\n2. Determine the number of blue flowers.\n3. Calculate the percentage of blue flowers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the total number of flowers.**\n\nMadeline has a total of 10 flowers.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of blue flowers.**\n\nWe know that 4 flowers are red and 2 flowers are white. The rest of the flowers are blue. Therefore, we can find the number of blue flowers by subtracting the number of red and white flowers from the total number of flowers.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue flowers} = 10 - 4 - 2 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the percentage of blue flowers.**\n\nTo find the percentage of blue flowers, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage of blue flowers} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of blue flowers}}{\\text{Total number of flowers}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage of blue flowers} = \\left( \\frac{4}{10} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.4 \\times 100 = 40\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage of flowers that are blue is \\boxed{40}.",
        "To determine the percentage of flowers that are blue, we first need to find out how many blue flowers Madeline has. We know that Madeline has a total of 10 flowers, with 4 being red and 2 being white. The rest of the flowers are blue.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of blue flowers by subtracting the number of red and white flowers from the total number of flowers:\n\\[\n10 - 4 - 2 = 4\n\\]\nSo, Madeline has 4 blue flowers.\n\nNext, we need to find what percentage 4 blue flowers represent out of the total 10 flowers.
