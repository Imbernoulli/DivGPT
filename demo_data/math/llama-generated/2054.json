        "To determine the total cost of two tubs of ice cream and 10 cans of juice during the sale, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the sale price of one tub of ice cream.\n2. Calculate the total cost for two tubs of ice cream.\n3. Calculate the cost of 10 cans of juice.\n4. Add the total cost of the ice cream and the total cost of the juice.\n\nFirst, let's find the sale price of one tub of ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $12, and it is sold for $2 less than its original price:\n\\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \\]\nSo, the sale price of one tub of ice cream is $10.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for two tubs of ice cream:\n\\[ 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\]\nSo, the total cost for two tubs of ice cream is $20.\n\nNow, let's find the cost of 10 cans of juice. The juice is sold at $2 for 5 cans. Therefore, the cost for 10 cans of juice is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\]\nSo, the total cost for 10 cans of juice is $4.\n\nFinally, we add the total cost of the ice cream and the total cost of the juice:\n\\[ 20 + 4 = 24 \\]\nSo, the total amount you will pay if you buy two tubs of ice cream and 10 cans of juice is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",

The original price is $12, and the discount is $2:\n\\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \\]\nSo, each tub of ice cream costs $10 during the sale.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for two tubs of ice cream:\n\\[ 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\]\nSo, the cost for two tubs of ice cream is $20.\n\nNow, let's find the cost of 10 cans of juice. The sale price is $2 for 5 cans, so we first determine the cost per can:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \\]\nSo, each can of juice costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost for 10 cans of juice is:\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 10 = 4 \\]\nSo, the cost for 10 cans of juice is $4.\n\nFinally, we add the cost of the two tubs of ice cream and the 10 cans of juice to get the total amount paid:\n\\[ 20 + 4 = 24 \\]\nSo, the total amount paid is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
