Calculate the cost of the burgers:\n   Selena ordered 2 types of burgers, each costing $3.5.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3.5 = 7\n   \\]\n   So, the cost of the burgers is $7.\n\n3. Calculate the cost of the ice cream:\n   Selena ordered 3 cups of ice cream, each costing $2.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the cost of the ice cream is $6.\n\n4. Calculate the total cost of the meal:\n   Add the costs of the steak meals, burgers, and ice cream.\n   \\[\n   48 + 7 + 6 = 61\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the meal is $61.\n\n5. Determine how much money Selena will be left with:\n   Subtract the total cost of the meal from the tip she received.\n   \\[\n   99 - 61 = 38\n   \\]\n   So, the amount of money Selena will be left with is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",
