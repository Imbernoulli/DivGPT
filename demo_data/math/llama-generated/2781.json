Add the pounds of lobster in Hooper Bay to the total pounds of lobster in the other two harbors.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total pounds of lobster in the two other harbors. Since each of the other two harbors has 80 pounds of lobster, we can find the total by multiplying 80 by 2:\n\\[ 80 \\times 2 = 160 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the pounds of lobster in Hooper Bay.

        "To determine the total pounds of lobster held by the three harbors, we start by calculating the amount of lobster in Hooper Bay. According to the problem, Hooper Bay has twice as many pounds of lobster as the two other harbors combined. First, we find the combined total of lobster in the two other harbors:\n\n\\[\n80 \\text{ pounds} + 80 \\text{ pounds} = 160 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of lobster in Hooper Bay, which is twice the combined total of the other two harbors:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 160 \\text{ pounds} = 320 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the amount of lobster in Hooper Bay to the amount of lobster in the other two harbors to find the total pounds of lobster held by all three harbors:\n\n\\[\n320 \\text{ pounds} + 160 \\text{ pounds} = 480 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total pounds of lobster held by the three harbors is \\boxed{480}.",
        "To determine the total pounds of lobster held by the three harbors, we start by identifying the amount of lobster in each harbor. Let's denote the pounds of lobster in Hooper Bay as \\( H \\) and the pounds of lobster in the other two harbors as \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the other two harbors each have 80 pounds of lobster. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ A = 80 \\]\n\\[ B = 80 \\]\n\nThe problem also states that Hooper Bay has twice as many pounds of lobster as the two other harbors combined. The total pounds of lobster in the two other harbors combined is:\n\\[ A + B = 80 + 80 = 160 \\]\n\nSince Hooper Bay has twice as many pounds of lobster as the two other harbors combined, we can write:\n\\[ H = 2 \\times (A + B) = 2 \\times 160 = 320 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total pounds of lobster held by all three harbors. This is the sum of the pounds of lobster in Hooper Bay and the pounds of lobster in the other two harbors:\n\\[ H + A + B = 320 + 80 + 80 = 480 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total pounds of lobster held by the three harbors is:\n\\[ \\boxed{480} \\]"
