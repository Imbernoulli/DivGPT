He spends 5 hours in the studio, where he writes, records, and edits his songs. Each song takes 12 minutes to record, then it takes 30 minutes to edit all of his songs.   How many minutes did it take Elvis to write each song, if each song took the same amount of time to write?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
