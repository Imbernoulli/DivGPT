        "To determine how many mangoes Colby still has, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the weight of mangoes sold to the community:**\n   Colby first sold 20 kilograms to the market. The total weight of mangoes he harvested is 60 kilograms. Therefore, the weight of mangoes left after selling to the market is:\n   \\[\n   60 - 20 = 40 \\text{ kilograms}\n   \\]\n   Colby then sold half of the remaining 40 kilograms to his community. So, the weight of mangoes sold to the community is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\text{ kilograms}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the weight of mangoes remaining:**\n   After selling 20 kilograms to the community, the weight of mangoes left is:\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20 \\text{ kilograms}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the weight of remaining mangoes to the number of mangoes:**\n   Each kilogram contains 8 mangoes. Therefore, the number of mangoes remaining is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 8 = 160\n   \\]\n\nSo, the number of mangoes Colby still has is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
