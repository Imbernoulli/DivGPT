He once played a three-letter word on a triple word score to earn thirty points.  If before the word score was tripled, the first and third letters were each valued at one point apiece, how much was the middle letter valued at before the word score was tripled?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the value of the middle letter in the three-letter word Jeremy played, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the total score after tripling**: Jeremy earned 30 points after playing the word on a triple word score.\n\n2. **Calculate the score before tripling**: Since the score was tripled, we divide the total score by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Score before tripling} = \\frac{30}{3} = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set up the equation for the word score**: Let \\( x \\) be the value of the middle letter. The first and third letters are each valued at 1 point. Therefore, the total score of the word before tripling is:\n   \\[\n   1 + x + 1 = 2 + x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**: We know the score before tripling is 10, so we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   2 + x = 10\n   \\]\n   Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 10 - 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 8\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the middle letter before the word score was tripled is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

The word score was tripled.\n\nLet's denote the value of the middle letter as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the total value of the three-letter word before it was tripled. Since the first and third letters each have a value of one point, their combined value is:\n\\[\n1 + 1 = 2 \\text{ points}\n\\]\n\nAdding the value of the middle letter \\( x \\), the total value of the word before it was tripled is:\n\\[\n2 + x \\text{ points}\n\\]\n\nSince the word score was tripled and Jeremy earned thirty points, we set up the following equation:\n\\[\n3 \\times (2 + x) = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\). First, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[\n2 + x = 10\n\\]\n\nThen, we subtract 2 from both sides:\n\\[\nx = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the middle letter before the word score was tripled is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
