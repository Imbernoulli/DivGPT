        "To determine the weights of Verna and Sherry, we start by identifying the weight of Haley, which is given as 103 pounds. According to the problem, Verna weighs 17 pounds more than Haley. Therefore, we can calculate Verna's weight as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Verna's weight} = \\text{Haley's weight} + 17 = 103 + 17 = 120 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Verna weighs half as much as Sherry.

Verna weighs 17 pounds more than Haley.\n2. Verna weighs half as much as Sherry.\n\nWe can express these relationships with the following equations:\n\\[ V = H + 17 \\]\n\\[ V = \\frac{S}{2} \\]\n\nSince we know Haley's weight (\\( H = 103 \\)), we can substitute 103 for \\( H \\) in the first equation to find Verna's weight:\n\\[ V = 103 + 17 \\]\n\\[ V = 120 \\]\n\nNow that we know Verna's weight is 120 pounds, we can use the second equation to find Sherry's weight. We substitute 120 for \\( V \\) in the second equation:\n\\[ 120 = \\frac{S}{2} \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( S \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ S = 120 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ S = 240 \\]\n\nNow we know that Verna weighs 120 pounds and Sherry weighs 240 pounds. To find the total weight of Verna and Sherry together, we add their weights:\n\\[ V + S = 120 + 240 \\]\n\\[ V + S = 360 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight of Verna and Sherry together is \\(\\boxed{360}\\).",
