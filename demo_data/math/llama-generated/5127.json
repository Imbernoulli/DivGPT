        "To determine how many yards of ribbon will be left after using it for the gifts, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of ribbon needed for the gifts.\n2. Subtract the total amount of ribbon needed from the total amount of ribbon Josh has.\n\nFirst, we know that Josh has 18 yards of ribbon and he wants to use it equally on 6 gifts. However, we are also given that each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon. So, we can directly calculate the total amount of ribbon needed for the gifts by multiplying the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift uses:\n\n\\[ 6 \\text{ gifts} \\times 2 \\text{ yards/gift} = 12 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount of ribbon needed from the total amount of ribbon Josh has:\n\n\\[ 18 \\text{ yards} - 12 \\text{ yards} = 6 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of yards of ribbon that will be left is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",

Therefore, the total amount of ribbon used is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ yards/gift} \\times 6 \\text{ gifts} = 12 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount of ribbon used from the original amount of ribbon:\n\\[ 18 \\text{ yards} - 12 \\text{ yards} = 6 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nSo, the number of yards of ribbon left is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
        "To determine how many yards of ribbon will be left, we start by calculating how much ribbon is used for the gifts.
