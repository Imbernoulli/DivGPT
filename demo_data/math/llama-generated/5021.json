        "To find the average number of surfers at the Rip Curl Myrtle Beach Surf Festival over the three days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of surfers on each day.\n2. Calculate the total number of surfers over the three days.\n3. Divide the total number of surfers by the number of days (which is 3) to find the average.\n\nLet's start with the number of surfers on each day:\n- On the first day, there were 1500 surfers.\n- On the second day, there were 600 more surfers than on the first day, so the number of surfers on the second day is \\(1500 + 600 = 2100\\).\n- On the third day, there were \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) as many surfers as on the first day, so the number of surfers on the third day is \\(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 1500 = \\frac{2 \\times 1500}{5} = \\frac{3000}{5} = 600\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of surfers over the three days:\n\\[1500 + 2100 + 600 = 4200\\]\n\nFinally, we find the average number of surfers over the three days by dividing the total number of surfers by 3:\n\\[\\frac{4200}{3} = 1400\\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of surfers at the Festival for the three days is \\(\\boxed{1400}\\).",

Therefore, the number of surfers on the second day is:\n  \\[\n  1500 + 600 = 2100\n  \\]\n- On the third day, there were \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) as many surfers as the first day.
