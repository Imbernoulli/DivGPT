        "To determine how many hours per week Ruth spends in math class, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours Ruth spends at school each week.\n2. Determine what 25% of that total time is.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of hours Ruth spends at school each week. She goes to school 8 hours a day and 5 days a week. Therefore, the total time spent at school each week is:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 40 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours per week she spends in math class. Since she spends 25% of her school time in math class, we calculate 25% of 40 hours:\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 40 \\text{ hours/week} = 10 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of hours per week Ruth spends in math class is \\boxed{10}.",

        "To determine how many hours per week Ruth spends in math class, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours Ruth spends at school in a week.\n2. Determine the fraction of this time that is spent in math class.\n3. Convert the fraction into hours.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of hours Ruth spends at school in a week. She goes to school 8 hours a day and 5 days a week, so we multiply these two numbers together:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 40 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Ruth spends 25% of her school time in math class.
