        "Let's denote the number of students in Tina's classroom as \\( T \\).

Therefore, the total number of students in Tina's and Maura's classrooms combined is \\( T + T = 2T \\).\n\nZack's classroom has half the number of students as the total number of students in Tina's and Maura's classrooms combined. So, the number of students in Zack's classroom is \\( \\frac{2T}{2} = T \\).\n\nWe are given that when Zack was sick, there were 22 students in his classroom.

        "To determine the total number of students in the three classrooms, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the number of students in Zack's classroom when he was sick:**\n   - When Zack was sick, there were 22 students in his class.

Therefore, if we let \\(T\\) represent the number of students in Tina's classroom and \\(M\\) represent the number of students in Maura's classroom, we know that \\(T = M\\). The total number of students between Tina's and Maura's classrooms is \\(T + M\\), which is \\(2T\\) since \\(T = M\\).\n   - Since Zack's classroom has half the number of students between Tina's and Maura's classrooms, we have:\n     \\[\n     23 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2T\n     \\]\n     Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n     \\[\n     23 = T\n     \\]\n     So, both Tina's and Maura's classrooms have 23 students each.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of students in all three classrooms:**\n   - The total number of students is the sum of the students in Tina's classroom, Maura's classroom, and Zack's classroom:\n     \\[\n     T + M + 23 = 23 + 23 + 23 = 69\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students in the three classrooms is \\(\\boxed{69}\\).",
