        "To determine the total number of pails of milk Farmer Red gets from his three cows each week, we need to calculate the daily milk production for each cow and then sum it up for the week.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much milk each cow produces daily:\n\n1. **Bess** gives 2 pails of milk every day.\n2. **Brownie** produces three times the amount of milk as Bess. Since Bess gives 2 pails, Brownie gives:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ pails}\n   \\]\n3. **Daisy** makes one pail more than Bess.
