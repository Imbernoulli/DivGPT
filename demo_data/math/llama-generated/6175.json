        "To determine the number of blueberries picked, we start by defining the quantities of each type of berry. Let's denote the number of raspberries as \\( R \\), the number of blackberries as \\( B \\), and the number of blueberries as \\( L \\). According to the problem, the total number of berries picked is 42. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ R + B + L = 42 \\]\n\nWe are given two additional pieces of information: half of all the berries were raspberries, and a third of the berries were blackberries. This gives us the following equations:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 42 = 21 \\]\n\\[ B = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 42 = 14 \\]\n\nNow that we know the values of \\( R \\) and \\( B \\), we can substitute these values into the first equation to find \\( L \\):\n\n\\[ 21 + 14 + L = 42 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 35 + L = 42 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( L \\), we subtract 35 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ L = 42 - 35 \\]\n\\[ L = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of blueberries picked is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",

        "To determine the number of blueberries, we start by defining the total number of berries and the given conditions. The total number of berries picked is 42. According to the problem, half of all the berries are raspberries, and a third of the berries are blackberries. We need to find out how many of the berries are blueberries.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of raspberries:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of raspberries} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 42 = 21\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of blackberries:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blackberries} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 42 = 14\n\\]\n\nThe total number of berries is the sum of the raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries. Therefore, the number of blueberries can be found by subtracting the number of raspberries and blackberries from the total number of berries:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blueberries} = 42 - 21 - 14 = 7\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of blueberries is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
