        "To determine the total number of eggs Mark supplies to the two stores in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs supplied to the first store each day.\n2. Calculate the total number of eggs supplied to the second store each day.\n3. Find the total number of eggs supplied to both stores each day.\n4. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week (7 days).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of eggs supplied to the first store each day. The first store receives 5 dozen eggs each day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we have:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ dozen} \\times 12 \\text{ eggs per dozen} = 60 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNext, we know the second store receives 30 eggs each day.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of eggs supplied to both stores each day:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ eggs} + 30 \\text{ eggs} = 90 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nFinally, to find the total number of eggs supplied in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ eggs per day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 630 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs Mark supplies to the two stores in a week is \\(\\boxed{630}\\).",

Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, we can calculate the daily supply to the first store as follows:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ dozen} \\times 12 \\text{ eggs per dozen} = 60 \\text{ eggs}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know the second store receives 30 eggs each day.

Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, the first store receives:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 12 = 60 \\text{ eggs}\n  \\]\n\n- The second store receives 30 eggs each day.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs supplied to both stores in one day.**\n\n- Adding the eggs supplied to both stores each day:\n  \\[\n  60 + 30 = 90 \\text{ eggs}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs supplied to both stores in a week.**\n\n- There are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total number of eggs supplied in a week is:\n  \\[\n  90 \\times 7 = 630 \\text{ eggs}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the total number of eggs Mark supplies to the two stores in a week is \\boxed{630}.",
        "To determine the total number of eggs Mark supplies to the two stores in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of eggs supplied to each store per day.\n\n1. ** store receives 5 dozen eggs each day.
