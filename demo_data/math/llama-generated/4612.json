It weighed 60 pounds and worked well for him in the beginning but after a bit of training he decides he wants to increase the weight by 60%.  The weights come in 2-pound steel ingots.  Each ingot cost $5 and if you buy more than 10 you get a 20% discount.  How much does it cost to get the weight he needs?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the cost of the additional weights Thomas needs, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the additional weight required:**\n   Thomas wants to increase the weight of his vest by 60%. The original weight of the vest is 60 pounds.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional weight} = 60 \\text{ pounds} \\times 0.60 = 36 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of ingots needed:**\n   Each ingot weighs 2 pounds.

The cost per ingot is $5. First, calculate the total cost without the discount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost without discount} = 18 \\text{ ingots} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/ingot} = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n   Next, calculate the discount amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount} = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.20 = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n   Finally, subtract the discount from the total cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost with discount} = 90 \\text{ dollars} - 18 \\text{ dollars} = 72 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost to get the weight Thomas needs is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).",

First, find the total cost without the discount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost without discount} = 18 \\text{ ingots} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/ingot} = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Next, calculate the discount amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount} = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.20 = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Subtract the discount from the total cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost with discount} = 90 \\text{ dollars} - 18 \\text{ dollars} = 72 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost to get the weight he needs is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).",
