Each lollipop uses 5ml of food colouring, and each hard candy also needs food colouring. In one day, the candy store makes 100 lollipops and 5 hard candies. They do not use food colouring in anything else. The store has used 600ml of food colouring by the end of the day. How much food colouring, in millilitres, does each hard candy need?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how much food colouring each hard candy needs, we start by calculating the total amount of food colouring used for the lollipops.

Therefore, the total amount of food colouring used for the lollipops is:\n\n\\[ 100 \\text{ lollipops} \\times 5 \\text{ ml/lollipop} = 500 \\text{ ml} \\]\n\nNext, we know that the store has used a total of 600 ml of food colouring by the end of the day. This total includes the food colouring used for both the lollipops and the hard candies. If we subtract the amount of food colouring used for the lollipops from the total amount used, we will find out how much food colouring was used for the hard candies:\n\n\\[ 600 \\text{ ml} - 500 \\text{ ml} = 100 \\text{ ml} \\]\n\nThe store makes 5 hard candies in one day, so the amount of food colouring used per hard candy is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{100 \\text{ ml}}{5 \\text{ hard candies}} = 20 \\text{ ml/hard candy} \\]\n\nTherefore, each hard candy needs \\(\\boxed{20}\\) ml of food colouring.",
        "To determine how much food colouring each hard candy needs, we start by calculating the total amount of food colouring used for the lollipops and then use the given total to find out how much was used for the hard candies.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of food colouring used for the lollipops. Each lollipop uses 5 ml of food colouring, and the store makes 100 lollipops. Therefore, the total amount of food colouring used for the lollipops is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ lollipops} \\times 5 \\text{ ml/lollipop} = 500 \\text{ ml} \\]\n\nNext, we know that the total amount of food colouring used in one day is 600 ml.
