        "To determine the number of Dutch Americans who sat at the windows, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of Dutch people on the bus:**\n   Given that there are 90 people on William's bus and \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of them are Dutch, we can find the number of Dutch people by multiplying:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Dutch people} = 90 \\times \\frac{3}{5} = 90 \\times 0.6 = 54\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of Dutch people who are also American:**\n   We are told that \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the Dutch people are also American. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Dutch Americans} = 54 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 54 \\times 0.5 = 27\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the number of Dutch Americans who got window seats:**\n   We are given that \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the Dutch Americans got window seats. Thus, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Dutch Americans who got window seats} = 27 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 27 \\times 0.3333\\ldots = 9\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of Dutch Americans who sat at the windows is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
