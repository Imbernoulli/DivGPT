        "To determine the height of the hill, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the vertical distance between the riverbed and the peak of the hill.\n2.

Therefore, we can write the equation:\n \\[\n 300 = \\frac{1}{4}D\n \\]\n\nTo find \\( D \\), we need to solve for \\( D \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[\nD = 300 \\times 4 = 1200\n\\]\n\nThe vertical distance \\( D \\) is the sum of the depth of the riverbed (which is the same as the base of the hill above the seabed) and the height of the hill above the riverbed. Since the base of the hill is 300 meters above the seabed, the height of the hill above the riverbed is:\n\\[\n\\text{Height of the hill} = D - 300 = 1200 - 300 = 900\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the hill is \\(\\boxed{900}\\) meters.",

Let's denote the vertical distance between the riverbed and the peak of the hill as \\( D \\). According to the problem, the depth of the riverbed below the base of the hill is \\( \\frac{D}{4} \\). Since the base of the hill is 300 meters above the seabed, the depth of the riverbed below the base of the hill is also 300 meters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   300 = \\frac{D}{4}\n   \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\( D \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:\n   \\[\n   D = 300 \\times 4 = 1200\n   \\]\n\n4. The vertical distance \\( D \\) is the sum of the height of the hill and the depth of the riverbed below the base of the hill. Since the depth of the riverbed below the base of the hill is 300 meters, the height of the hill is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height of the hill} = D - 300 = 1200 - 300 = 900\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the hill is \\(\\boxed{900}\\) meters.",

Therefore, the total vertical distance is \\( 300 + h \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the depth of the riverbed (300 meters) is a quarter of this total vertical distance. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\\[ 300 = \\frac{1}{4}(300 + h) \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( h \\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[ 4 \\cdot 300 = 300 + h \\]\n\\[ 1200 = 300 + h \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( h \\) by subtracting 300 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 1200 - 300 = h \\]\n\\[ h = 900 \\]\n\nThus, the height of the hill is \\(\\boxed{900}\\) meters.",
