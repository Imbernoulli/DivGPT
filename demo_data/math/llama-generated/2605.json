If she sells 5000 widgets, the total cost of the widgets is:\n   \\[\n   5000 \\times 3 = 15000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Fixed Costs:**\n   Jenna has to pay $10,000 in rent and $2,500 to each of her four workers. The total cost for her workers is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 2500 = 10000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total fixed costs are:\n   \\[\n   10000 + 10000 = 20000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Profit Before Taxes:**\n   The profit before taxes is the total revenue minus the total cost of the widgets and the total fixed costs:\n   \\[\n   40000 - 15000 - 20000 = 5000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Taxes:**\n   Jenna pays 20% of her total profit in taxes. The amount of taxes she has to pay is:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 5000 = 1000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Net Profit After Taxes:**\n   The net profit after taxes is the profit before taxes minus the taxes:\n   \\[\n   5000 - 1000 = 4000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jenna's total profit or loss for the month is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4000}\n\\]",
