        "To determine the total cost of the picnic basket, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item separately and then sum these costs.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the sandwiches:**\n   - Theo and Tia invited 2 friends, so there are 4 people in total.\n   - Each person gets one sandwich.\n   - Therefore, they need \\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\) sandwiches.\n   - Each sandwich costs $5.\n   - Total cost for sandwiches: \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\) dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the fruit salads:**\n   - Each person gets one fruit salad.\n   - Therefore, they need \\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\) fruit salads.\n   - Each fruit salad costs $3.\n   - Total cost for fruit salads: \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the sodas:**\n   - Each person gets 2 sodas.\n   - Therefore, they need \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) sodas.\n   - Each soda costs $2.\n   - Total cost for sodas: \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\) dollars.\n\n4. **Calculate the cost of the snack bags:**\n   - They buy 3 bags of snacks.\n   - Each snack bag costs $4.\n   - Total cost for snack bags: \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) dollars.\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost of the entire picnic basket:**\n   - Total cost for sandwiches: $20\n   - Total cost for fruit salads: $12\n   - Total cost for sodas: $16\n   - Total cost for snack bags: $12\n   - Total cost: \\(20 + 12 + 16 + 12 = 60\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Theo and Tia spent on the entire contents of their picnic basket is \\(\\boxed{60}\\) dollars.",
