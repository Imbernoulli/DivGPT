        "To determine the average time it took Rich to run a mile during the race, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the total time into minutes:**\n   Rich's total time for the marathon is 3 hours and 36 minutes. We need to convert hours into minutes and then add the additional minutes.\n\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - Therefore, 3 hours is \\( 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\) minutes.\n   - Adding the additional 36 minutes gives us \\( 180 + 36 = 216 \\) minutes.\n\n2. **Calculate the average time per mile:**\n   Rich ran a total of 24 miles. To find the average time per mile, we divide the total time by the total number of miles.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average time per mile} = \\frac{\\text{Total time}}{\\text{Total distance}} = \\frac{216 \\text{ minutes}}{24 \\text{ miles}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the division:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{216}{24} = 9\n   \\]\n\nThus, the average time it took Rich to run a mile during the race is \\(\\boxed{9}\\) minutes.",
