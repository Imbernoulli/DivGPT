        "To determine how many days it will take for the toothpaste to run out, we need to calculate the total daily usage of toothpaste by the family and then divide the total amount of toothpaste by this daily usage.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily usage for each family member:\n- Anne's dad uses 3 grams per brushing and brushes his teeth 3 times a day, so his daily usage is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ grams/brushing} \\times 3 \\text{ brushings/day} = 9 \\text{ grams/day}\n  \\]\n- Anne's mom uses 2 grams per brushing and brushes her teeth 3 times a day, so her daily usage is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ grams/brushing} \\times 3 \\text{ brushings/day} = 6 \\text{ grams/day}\n  \\]\n- Anne uses 1 gram per brushing and brushes her teeth 3 times a day, so her daily usage is:\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ gram/brushing} \\times 3 \\text{ brushings/day} = 3 \\text{ grams/day}\n  \\]\n- Anne's brother uses 1 gram per brushing and brushes his teeth 3 times a day, so his daily usage is:\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ gram/brushing} \\times 3 \\text{ brushings/day} = 3 \\text{ grams/day}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's sum up the daily usage of all family members:\n\\[\n9 \\text{ grams/day} + 6 \\text{ grams/day} + 3 \\text{ grams/day} + 3 \\text{ grams/day} = 21 \\text{ grams/day}\n\\]\n\nNow, we divide the total amount of toothpaste by the daily usage to find out how many days it will take for the toothpaste to run out:\n\\[\n\\frac{105 \\text{ grams}}{21 \\text{ grams/day}} = 5 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the toothpaste will run out in \\boxed{5} days.",
