To find out how much her wage increases, we calculate 20% of $10:\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } 10 = 0.20 \\times 10 = 2 \\]\nSo, her new hourly wage after the first year is:\n\\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Cary's hourly wage after the second year.**\n\nIn the second year, her pay is cut to 75% of what it was after the first year. To find out how much her wage is after the second year, we calculate 75% of $12:\n\\[ 75\\% \\text{ of } 12 = 0.75 \\times 12 = 9 \\]\nSo, her hourly wage now is:\n\\[ 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, Cary now makes \\(\\boxed{9}\\) dollars per hour.",
