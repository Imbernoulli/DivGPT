He wants to know which is the better value, so instead of just looking at the overall price, he looks at the price per ounce. The larger box is 30 ounces and the smaller box is 20 ounces. The larger box costs $4.80. The smaller box costs $3.40. What is the price per ounce in cents of the box with the better value (lowest price per ounce)?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine which box of macaroni and cheese is the better value, we need to calculate the price per ounce for each box and then compare the two.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the price per ounce for the larger box. The larger box is 30 ounces and costs $4.80. To find the price per ounce, we divide the total cost by the number of ounces:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price per ounce of the larger box} = \\frac{4.80 \\text{ dollars}}{30 \\text{ ounces}} = 0.16 \\text{ dollars per ounce}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's convert this price per ounce to cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply by 100:\n\n\\[\n0.16 \\text{ dollars per ounce} \\times 100 = 16 \\text{ cents per ounce}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the price per ounce for the smaller box. The smaller box is 20 ounces and costs $3.40. To find the price per ounce, we divide the total cost by the number of ounces:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price per ounce of the smaller box} = \\frac{3.40 \\text{ dollars}}{20 \\text{ ounces}} = 0.17 \\text{ dollars per ounce}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's convert this price per ounce to cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply by 100:\n\n\\[\n0.17 \\text{ dollars per ounce} \\times 100 = 17 \\text{ cents per ounce}\n\\]\n\nBy comparing the two prices per ounce, we see that the larger box has a lower price per ounce. Therefore, the box with the better value is the larger box, and the price per ounce is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]",
