Use the information about Angus's fish to find out how many fish Patrick caught.\n\nWe know from the problem statement that Ollie caught 5 fish. According to the problem, Ollie caught 7 fewer fish than Angus. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many fish Angus caught:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fish Angus caught} = \\text{Number of fish Ollie caught} + 7\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the number of fish Ollie caught into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fish Angus caught} = 5 + 7 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Angus caught 4 more fish than Patrick. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many fish Patrick caught:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fish Patrick caught} = \\text{Number of fish Angus caught} - 4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the number of fish Angus caught into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fish Patrick caught} = 12 - 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of fish Patrick caught is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
