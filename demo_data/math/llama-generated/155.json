Since one dozen equals 12 watermelons, the total number of watermelons is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 12 = 120\n   \\]\n\n2. Alice sold 40% of the watermelons yesterday. The number of watermelons sold yesterday is:\n   \\[\n   0.40 \\times 120 = 48\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after yesterday's sale is:\n   \\[\n   120 - 48 = 72\n   \\]\n\n3. Alice sold \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the remaining watermelons today. The number of watermelons sold today is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 72 = 18\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after today's sale is:\n   \\[\n   72 - 18 = 54\n   \\]\n\nSo, the number of watermelons left to be sold tomorrow is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{54}\n\\]",

        "To determine how many watermelons Alice has left to sell tomorrow, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of watermelons Alice initially had:**\n   Alice had 10 dozens of watermelons. Since each dozen contains 12 watermelons, we multiply:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 12 = 120 \\text{ watermelons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many watermelons Alice sold yesterday:**\n   Alice sold 40% of her watermelons yesterday. To find 40% of 120, we use the formula for percentage:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Watermelons sold yesterday} = 0.40 \\times 120 = 48 \\text{ watermelons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of watermelons remaining after yesterday’s sale:**\n   Subtract the number of watermelons sold yesterday from the initial total:\n   \\[\n   120 - 48 = 72 \\text{ watermelons}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many watermelons Alice sold today:**\n   Alice sold \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the remaining watermelons today. To find \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of 72, we perform the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Watermelons sold today} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 72 = 18 \\text{ watermelons}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of watermelons remaining after today’s sale:**\n   Subtract the number of watermelons sold today from the remaining after yesterday’s sale:\n   \\[\n   72 - 18 = 54 \\text{ watermelons}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of watermelons left to be sold tomorrow is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
        "First, we need to determine the total number of watermelons Alice had initially. Since she had 10 dozens of watermelons, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 12 = 120 \\text{ watermelons} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many watermelons she sold yesterday. She sold 40% of the watermelons, so we find 40% of 120:\n\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 120 = 48 \\text{ watermelons} \\]\n\nAfter selling 48 watermelons, we need to find out how many watermelons are left.

To find 40% of 120:\n   \\[\n   0.40 \\times 120 = 48\n   \\]\n   So, Alice sold 48 watermelons yesterday.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of watermelons remaining after yesterday's sale:**\n   Subtract the number of watermelons sold from the initial total:\n   \\[\n   120 - 48 = 72\n   \\]\n   So, Alice has 72 watermelons remaining after yesterday's sale.\n\n4. **Determine how many watermelons Alice sold today:**\n   Alice sold \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the remaining watermelons today. To find \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of 72:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 72 = 18\n   \\]\n   So, Alice sold 18 watermelons today.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of watermelons remaining after today's sale:**\n   Subtract the number of watermelons sold today from the remaining total after yesterday:\n   \\[\n   72 - 18 = 54\n   \\]\n   So, Alice has 54 watermelons left to be sold tomorrow.\n\nTherefore, the number of watermelons left to be sold tomorrow is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",

Since one dozen equals 12 watermelons, we have:\n\\[ 10 \\times 12 = 120 \\text{ watermelons} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many watermelons she sold yesterday. She sold 40% of the watermelons:\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 120 = 48 \\text{ watermelons} \\]\n\nAfter selling 48 watermelons, the number of watermelons left is:\n\\[ 120 - 48 = 72 \\text{ watermelons} \\]\n\nToday, she sold \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the remaining watermelons:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 72 = 18 \\text{ watermelons} \\]\n\nAfter selling 18 watermelons today, the number of watermelons left is:\n\\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \\text{ watermelons} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of watermelons left to be sold tomorrow is:\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]",
        "To determine how many watermelons Alice has left to be sold tomorrow, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of watermelons Alice initially had:**\n   Alice had 10 dozens of watermelons.
