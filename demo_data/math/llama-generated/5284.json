        "To determine how many apple pies remain with Cooper, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of apple pies Cooper makes in 12 days.\n2. Subtract the number of pies Ashley eats from the total number of pies Cooper made.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of apple pies Cooper makes in 12 days. Since he makes 7 apple pies each day, we multiply 7 by 12:\n\\[\n7 \\times 12 = 84\n\\]\nSo, Cooper makes 84 apple pies in 12 days.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of pies Ashley eats from the total number of pies Cooper made. Ashley eats 50 pies, so we subtract 50 from 84:\n\\[\n84 - 50 = 34\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of apple pies that remain with Cooper is \\boxed{34}.",
