The first lawsuit has a 30% chance of paying out $5,000,000 upon a win and $0 if he loses it. The second lawsuit has a 50% chance of paying out $1,000,000 if Andy loses and a 50% chance of paying out $2,000,000 if he wins.

        "To determine how much more likely it is that Andy loses both lawsuits compared to winning both of them, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then find the difference between these probabilities.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of Andy losing both lawsuits. The probability of losing the first lawsuit is 70% (or 0.70), and the probability of losing the second lawsuit is 50% (or 0.50).
