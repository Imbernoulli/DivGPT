They were found to have different numbers of damaged teeth, and each person had some teeth removed. The first person had 1/4 of all his teeth removed, and the second person had 3/8 of his teeth removed, the third person had half of his teeth removed, while the last person only had 4 teeth removed. What's the total number of teeth removed at the dental clinic?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
