        "To find the average height of the trees that Jackie climbed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the height of each tree she climbed.\n2. Calculate the total height of all the trees.\n3. Divide the total height by the number of trees to find the average height.\n\nFirst, let's list the heights of the trees:\n- The first tree is 1000 feet tall.\n- The second and third trees are each half as tall as the first tree. Since the first tree is 1000 feet tall, each of the second and third trees is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n- The fourth tree is 200 feet taller than the first tree. Since the first tree is 1000 feet tall, the fourth tree is:\n  \\[\n  1000 + 200 = 1200 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total height of all the trees:\n\\[\n1000 + 500 + 500 + 1200 = 3200 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we divide the total height by the number of trees to find the average height. Jackie climbed 4 trees, so the average height is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3200}{4} = 800 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average height of the trees that Jackie climbed is \\boxed{800}.",
