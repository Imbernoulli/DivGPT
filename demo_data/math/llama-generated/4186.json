        "To determine the total amount of money Bowen spends, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pencils Bowen buys.\n2. Calculate the cost of the pens.\n3. Calculate the cost of the pencils.\n4. Add the costs of the pens and pencils to get the total amount spent.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many pencils Bowen buys. Bowen buys 40 pens and 2/5 times more pencils than pens. So, the number of pencils is:\n\\[\n40 + \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 40\\right)\n\\]\nCalculate \\(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 40\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times 40 = \\frac{2 \\times 40}{5} = \\frac{80}{5} = 16\n\\]\nSo, the total number of pencils Bowen buys is:\n\\[\n40 + 16 = 56\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the pens. Each pen costs 15 cents, and Bowen buys 40 pens. So, the cost of the pens is:\n\\[\n40 \\times 15 = 600 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 25 cents, and Bowen buys 56 pencils. So, the cost of the pencils is:\n\\[\n56 \\times 25 = 1400 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the costs of the pens and pencils to get the total amount spent:\n\\[\n600 + 1400 = 2000 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\nSince 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, we convert 2000 cents to dollars:\n\\[\n2000 \\div 100 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Bowen spends is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",

        "To determine the total amount of money Bowen spends, we need to calculate the cost of the pens and the pencils separately and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we find out how many pencils Bowen buys. Bowen buys 40 pens and 2/5 times more pencils than pens. Therefore, the number of pencils is:\n\\[ 40 + \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 40\\right) = 40 + \\left(\\frac{2 \\times 40}{5}\\right) = 40 + \\left(\\frac{80}{5}\\right) = 40 + 16 = 56 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the pens. Since each pen costs 15 cents, the total cost for the pens is:\n\\[ 40 \\times 15 = 600 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the cost of the pencils. Since each pencil costs 25 cents, the total cost for the pencils is:\n\\[ 56 \\times 25 = 1400 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the total amount of money Bowen spends by adding the cost of the pens and the cost of the pencils:\n\\[ 600 + 1400 = 2000 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nSince 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, we convert 2000 cents to dollars:\n\\[ 2000 \\div 100 = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Bowen spends is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
