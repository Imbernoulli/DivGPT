        "To determine how many students were present last Monday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students who were absent.\n2. Subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students to find the number of students present.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of students who were absent. We know that two-sevenths of the students were absent. The total number of students in the class is 28. So, we can find the number of absent students by multiplying 28 by \\(\\frac{2}{7}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of absent students} = 28 \\times \\frac{2}{7}\n\\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication, we can simplify the expression:\n\n\\[\n28 \\times \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{28 \\times 2}{7} = \\frac{56}{7} = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, 8 students were absent. Next, we subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students to find the number of students present:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of present students} = 28 - 8 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students present last Monday is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
