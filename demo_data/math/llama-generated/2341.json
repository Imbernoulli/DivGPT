In the first route, he walks for 6 minutes uphill, walks for twice this amount of time along a path, then finishes the journey in a third of the time it took to walk the first two stages. In the second route, he walks along a flat path for 14 minutes, then finishes the walk in twice this amount of time. In minutes, how much longer was the second route compared with the first?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
