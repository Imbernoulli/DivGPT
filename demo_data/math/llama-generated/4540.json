        "To determine the total distance Ms. Warren ran and walked, we need to calculate the distance for each activity separately and then sum the distances.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance she ran:\n- Ms. Warren ran at a speed of 6 miles per hour (mph) for 20 minutes.\n- Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 20 minutes is equivalent to \\(\\frac{20}{60} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) of an hour.\n- The distance she ran is given by the formula: \\(\\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time}\\).\n- Therefore, the distance she ran is \\(6 \\text{ mph} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hour} = 2 \\text{ miles}\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance she walked:\n- Ms. Warren walked at a speed of 2 miles per hour (mph) for 30 minutes.\n- Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is equivalent to \\(\\frac{30}{60} = \\frac{1}{2}\\) of an hour.\n- The distance she walked is given by the formula: \\(\\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time}\\).\n- Therefore, the distance she walked is \\(2 \\text{ mph} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ hour} = 1 \\text{ mile}\\).\n\nFinally, we sum the distances she ran and walked:\n- The total distance is \\(2 \\text{ miles} + 1 \\text{ mile} = 3 \\text{ miles}\\).\n\nThus, the total distance Ms. Warren ran and walked is \\(\\boxed{3}\\) miles.",
