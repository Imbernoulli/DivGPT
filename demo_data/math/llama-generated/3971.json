Since she works 4 hours, which is equivalent to 8 sets of 30 minutes, and she writes 5 articles in 30 minutes, we can calculate the number of articles she writes in a regular workday as follows:\n\\[ 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\text{ articles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of articles she writes on Thursday, when she worked an extra 2 hours. Since 2 hours is equivalent to 4 sets of 30 minutes, the number of articles she writes on Thursday is:\n\\[ 40 + 4 \\times 5 = 40 + 20 = 60 \\text{ articles} \\]\n\nThen, we need to calculate the number of articles she writes on Friday, when she worked an extra 3 hours. Since 3 hours is equivalent to 6 sets of 30 minutes, the number of articles she writes on Friday is:\n\\[ 40 + 6 \\times 5 = 40 + 30 = 70 \\text{ articles} \\]\n\nFor the other three days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), she works her regular 4-hour workday, so she writes:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ articles per day} \\]\n\nNow, we can sum up the total number of articles she writes for the entire week:\n\\[ 40 + 60 + 70 + 40 + 40 = 250 \\text{ articles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of articles Helga was able to write this week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{250} \\]",

        "To determine the total number of articles Helga wrote this week, we need to calculate her regular work hours and the extra hours she worked last Thursday and Friday, then find out how many articles she writes per hour.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Helga's regular work hours for the week:\n- Helga works 4 hours a day.\n- She works 5 days a week.\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 20 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the extra hours she worked last Thursday and Friday:\n- She worked an extra 2 hours on Thursday.\n- She worked an extra 3 hours on Friday.\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ hours} + 3 \\text{ hours} = 5 \\text{ extra hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the extra hours to her regular work hours to get the total hours she worked this week:\n\n\\[\n20 \\text{ hours/week} + 5 \\text{ extra hours} = 25 \\text{ total hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many articles Helga writes per hour.
