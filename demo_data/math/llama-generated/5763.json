Determine the difference between the time the bus leaves and the time Delaney reaches the bus pick-up point.\n\nFirst, we know Delaney left his home at 7:50 a.m. and it takes him 30 minutes to reach the bus pick-up point. Therefore, we add 30 minutes to 7:50 a.m.:\n\n\\[ 7:50 + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 8:20 \\text{ a.m.} \\]\n\nThe bus leaves at 8:00 a.m. So, we need to find out how much later 8:20 a.m. is compared to 8:00 a.m.:\n\n\\[ 8:20 - 8:00 = 20 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThus, Delaney missed the bus by \\(\\boxed{20}\\) minutes.",
