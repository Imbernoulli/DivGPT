Roger, the oldest one, said that he has the same amount of experience in years as all four of the others combined and that his retirement should come when he accumulates 50 years of experience. Peter said that when he came to the company his daughter was 7 years old, and now she is 19 years old. Tom then said he has twice as many years of experience as Robert. Robert said that he has 4 years of experience less than Peter but 2 more years of experience than Mike. How many more years does Roger have to work before he retires?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "Let's define the variables for the experience of each coworker:\n- \\( R \\) is Roger's experience.\n- \\( P \\) is Peter's experience.\n- \\( T \\) is Tom's experience.\n- \\( B \\) is Robert's experience.\n- \\( M \\) is Mike's experience.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following equations:\n1. Roger has the same amount of experience as all four of the others combined:\n   \\[\n   R = P + T + B + M\n   \\]\n2. Peter's daughter has increased her age from 7 to 19, so Peter has been working for:\n   \\[\n   P = 19 - 7 = 12\n   \\]\n3.

Tom has twice as many years of experience as Robert.\n4. Robert has 4 years of experience less than Peter.\n5. Robert has 2 more years of experience than Mike.\n\nFirst, we can determine Peter's experience from the information about his daughter's age:\n\\[ P = 19 - 7 = 12 \\]\n\nNext, we use the information about Robert's experience:\n\\[ B = P - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \\]\n\nThen, we use the information about Tom's experience:\n\\[ T = 2B = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\n\nFinally, we use the information about Mike's experience:\n\\[ B = M + 2 \\implies M = B - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 \\]\n\nNow, we know the experience of each coworker:\n- Roger: \\( R \\)\n- Peter: 12\n- Tom: 16\n- Robert: 8\n- Mike: 6\n\nFrom the first piece of information, Roger has the same amount of experience as all four of the others combined:\n\\[ R = P + T + B + M = 12 + 16 + 8 + 6 = 42 \\]\n\nRoger's retirement should come when he accumulates 50 years of experience. Therefore, the number of years Roger has to work before he retires is:\n\\[ 50 - R = 50 - 42 = 8 \\]\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",
        "Let's define the variables for the experience of each coworker:\n- Let \\( R \\) be the experience of Roger.\n- Let \\( P \\) be the experience of Peter.\n- Let \\( T \\) be the experience of Tom.\n- Let \\( B \\) be the experience of Robert.\n- Let \\( M \\) be the experience of Mike.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following information:\n1. Roger has the same amount of experience as all four of the others combined:\n   \\[\n   R = P + T + B + M\n   \\]\n2. Peter's daughter was 7 years old when he started at the company and is now 19 years old, so Peter has \\( 19 - 7 = 12 \\) years of experience:\n   \\[\n   P = 12\n   \\]\n3. Tom has twice as many years of experience as Robert:\n   \\[\n   T = 2B\n   \\]\n4. Robert has 4 years of experience less than Peter but 2 more years of experience than Mike:\n   \\[\n   B = P - 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B = M + 2\n   \\]\n   Since \\( P = 12 \\), we can substitute this value into the equation for Robert's experience:\n   \\[\n   B = 12 - 4 = 8\n   \\]\n   Now, we can find Mike's experience:\n   \\[\n   B = M + 2 \\implies 8 = M + 2 \\implies M = 6\n   \\]\n   And we can find Tom's experience:\n   \\[\n   T = 2B = 2 \\times 8 = 16\n   \\]\n   Now we substitute the values of \\( P \\), \\( T \\), \\( B \\), and \\( M \\) into the equation for Roger's experience:\n   \\[\n   R = P + T + B + M = 12 + 16 + 8 + 6 = 42\n   \\]\n   Roger has 42 years of experience. Since his retirement should come when he accumulates 50 years of experience, he has:\n   \\[\n   50 - 42 = 8\n   \\]\n   more years to work before he retires. Therefore, the answer is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{8}\n   \\]"
