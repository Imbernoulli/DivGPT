        "To determine how many pieces of gum Mitchell chews at once, we start by calculating the total number of pieces of gum he has. Mitchell has 8 packets of gum, and each packet contains 7 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum is:\n\n\\[\n8 \\times 7 = 56\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pieces of gum Mitchell chews, given that he leaves 2 pieces伯ыта. This means he chews:\n\n\\[\n56 - 2 = 54\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of pieces of gum Mitchell chews at once is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{54}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many pieces of gum Mitchell chews at once, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Mitchell has.\n2. Subtract the number of pieces he does not chew from the total number of pieces.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of pieces of gum. Mitchell has 8 packets of gum, and each packet contains 7 pieces. So, we multiply the number of packets by the number of pieces per packet:\n\\[ 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of pieces Mitchell does not chew from the total number of pieces. Mitchell does not chew 2 pieces, so we subtract 2 from 56:\n\\[ 56 - 2 = 54 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces Mitchell chews at once is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",

Mitchell doesn't chew 2 pieces, so the number of pieces he chews is:\n\\[ 56 - 2 = 54 \\]\n\nThus, the number of pieces of gum Mitchell chews at once is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
        "To determine how many pieces of gum Mitchell chews at once, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Mitchell has.\n2. Subtract the number of pieces he does not chew from the total number of pieces.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of pieces of gum. Mitchell has 8 packets, and each packet contains 7 pieces. So, we multiply the number of packets by the number of pieces per packet:\n\\[ 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of pieces Mitchell does not chew from the total number of pieces. Mitchell does not chew 2 pieces, so we subtract 2 from 56:\n\\[ 56 - 2 = 54 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces Mitchell chews at once is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
