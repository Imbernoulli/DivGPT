Therefore, the number of comic books Arthur can buy is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ dollars} \\div 6 \\text{ dollars/comic book} = 16 \\text{ comic books} \\quad \\text{(with a remainder)} \\]\n\nTo find out the exact remainder, we perform the division:\n\\[ 100 \\div 6 = 16 \\text{ R } 4 \\]\nThis means that Arthur can buy 16 comic books and have a remainder of 4 dollars.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the comic books he buys.**\n\nThe total cost for 16 comic books is:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ comic books} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars/comic book} = 96 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find out how much money Arthur has leftover after buying the comic books.**\n\nThe leftover money is the remainder from the division:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ dollars} - 96 \\text{ dollars} = 4 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Arthur has leftover is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]",
        "To determine how much money Arthur has leftover after selling his basketball cards and buying comic books, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.
