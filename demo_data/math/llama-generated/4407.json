Therefore, the cost of the headphones is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{200 \\text{ dollars}}{2} = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the costs of all the items:\n\\[\n1000 \\text{ dollars} + 2400 \\text{ dollars} + 200 \\text{ dollars} + 100 \\text{ dollars} = 3700 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount Lisa will spend on her phone in the first year is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3700}\n\\]",
        "To determine how much Lisa will spend on her phone in the first year, we need to add up the costs of the phone, the phone contract, the case, and the headphones.
