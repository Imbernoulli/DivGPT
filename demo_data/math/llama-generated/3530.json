Determine how many days it will take for the total weight of leaves to reach the maximum weight the roof can bear.\n\nFirst, we calculate the weight of leaves that fall on the roof each day. We know that 100 leaves fall on the roof every day, and 1000 leaves weigh 1 pound. Therefore, the weight of 100 leaves is:\n\\[\n\\text{Weight of leaves per day} = \\frac{100 \\text{ leaves}}{1000 \\text{ leaves per pound}} = 0.1 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days it will take for the total weight of leaves to reach 500 pounds. Let \\( d \\) be the number of days. The total weight of leaves after \\( d \\) days is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total weight of leaves} = 0.1 \\text{ pounds/day} \\times d\n\\]\nWe set this equal to the maximum weight the roof can bear, which is 500 pounds:\n\\[\n0.1d = 500\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( d \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.1:\n\\[\nd = \\frac{500}{0.1} = 5000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take \\(\\boxed{5000}\\) days for Bill's roof to collapse.",
