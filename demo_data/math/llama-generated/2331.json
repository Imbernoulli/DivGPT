        "To determine the age of Tom's dog, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Age of the cat**: Tom's cat is 8 years old.\n2. **Age of the rabbit**: The rabbit is half the age of the cat. Therefore, we calculate the rabbit's age as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Age of the rabbit} = \\frac{\\text{Age of the cat}}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n3. **Age of the dog**: The dog is three times as old as the rabbit.

        "To determine the age of Tom's dog, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.\n\n1. First, we know the age of Tom's cat is 8 years old.\n2. Next, we are told that Tom's rabbit is half the age of his cat. Therefore, we calculate the age of the rabbit as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Age of the rabbit} = \\frac{\\text{Age of the cat}}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n3. Then, we are told that Tom's dog is three times as old as his rabbit. Therefore, we calculate the age of the dog as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Age of the dog} = 3 \\times \\text{Age of the rabbit} = 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the age of the dog is \\boxed{12}."
