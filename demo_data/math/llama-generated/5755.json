        "To determine how much Glenn spends on movie tickets, we need to calculate the cost of a ticket on Wednesday and Saturday and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we find the cost of a ticket on Wednesday. The problem states that a ticket costs twice as much on Wednesday as it does on Monday. Since a ticket costs $5 on Monday, we calculate the cost on Wednesday as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 5 = 10\n\\]\nSo, a ticket costs $10 on Wednesday.\n\nNext, we find the cost of a ticket on Saturday. The problem states that a ticket costs five times as much on Saturday as it does on Monday. Since a ticket costs $5 on Monday, we calculate the cost on Saturday as follows:\n\\[\n5 \\times 5 = 25\n\\]\nSo, a ticket costs $25 on Saturday.\n\nNow, we add the cost of the ticket on Wednesday and the cost of the ticket on Saturday to find the total amount Glenn spends:\n\\[\n10 + 25 = 35\n\\]\nTherefore, the total amount Glenn spends is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",

Identify the cost of a movie ticket on each day:\n   - On Monday, the cost is $5.\n   - On Wednesday, the cost is twice as much as on Monday, so we calculate:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 5 = 10\n     \\]\n     Therefore, the cost on Wednesday is $10.\n   - On Saturday, the cost is five times as much as on Monday, so we calculate:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 5 = 25\n     \\]\n     Therefore, the cost on Saturday is $25.\n\n2. Calculate the total cost for the tickets Glenn buys:\n   - Glenn goes to the movie theater on Wednesday and Saturday.\n   - The cost on Wednesday is $10.\n   - The cost on Saturday is $25.\n   - Adding these amounts together gives:\n     \\[\n     10 + 25 = 35\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Glenn spends is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",
        "To determine how much Glenn spends on movie tickets when he goes to the theater on Wednesday and Saturday, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets for each day and then sum these costs.\n\nFirst, we find the cost of a movie ticket on Wednesday.
