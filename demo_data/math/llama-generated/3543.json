Since Rose got 2 more correct answers than Liza, we add 2 to the number of correct answers Liza got:\n\n\\[\n54 + 2 = 56\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Rose got 56 items correct. To find out how many incorrect answers Rose had, we subtract the number of correct answers she got from the total number of items on the exam:\n\n\\[\n60 - 56 = 4\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of incorrect answers Rose had is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
