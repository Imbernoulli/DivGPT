        "To determine the total amount of money John has spent after buying the lightsaber, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of John's other Star Wars toys.\n2. Calculate the cost of the lightsaber.\n3. Add the cost of the lightsaber to the cost of his other Star Wars toys.\n\nFirst, we know that the cost of John's other Star Wars toys is $1000.\n\nNext, we are told that the lightsaber is twice as expensive as all his other Star Wars toys combined. Therefore, we calculate the cost of the lightsaber as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of lightsaber} = 2 \\times \\text{Cost of other Star Wars toys} = 2 \\times 1000 = 2000\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the lightsaber to the cost of his other Star Wars toys to find the total amount of money John has spent:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount spent} = \\text{Cost of other Star Wars toys} + \\text{Cost of lightsaber} = 1000 + 2000 = 3000\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money John has spent in all after buying the lightsaber is \\(\\boxed{3000}\\).",
