        "To determine the length of the shorter part of the rope, we start by understanding the ratio given, which is 2:3. This means that the rope is divided into two parts such that the length of the first part is 2 units and the length of the second part is 3 units for every 5 units of the rope.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many 5-unit segments are in the 40-meter rope. We do this by dividing the total length of the rope by the sum of the parts of the ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of 5-unit segments} = \\frac{40}{2+3} = \\frac{40}{5} = 8\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the length of the shorter part by multiplying the number of 5-unit segments by the length of the first part of the ratio (which is 2 units):\n\\[\n\\text{Length of the shorter part} = 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of the shorter part of the rope is \\boxed{16}."
