He uses Pittsburg city as a reference which has 2000 stores, 500 hospitals, 200 schools, and 20 police stations. If the new city should have half the number of stores, twice as many hospitals, 50 fewer schools, and 5 more police stations, what is the total number of buildings required for this project?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
