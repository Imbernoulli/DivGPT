        "To determine how many vehicles can still park in the lot after 3 caravans are already parked, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of parking space occupied by the caravans.\n2. Subtract the occupied parking space from the total available parking space to find out how much space is left.\n3. Determine how many vehicles can park in the remaining spaces.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Each caravan takes up 2 spaces. Since there are 3 caravans, the total space occupied by the caravans is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ caravans} \\times 2 \\text{ spaces per caravan} = 6 \\text{ spaces}\n   \\]\n\n2. The total available parking space is 30 spaces. After the caravans have parked, the remaining parking space is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ spaces} - 6 \\text{ spaces} = 24 \\text{ spaces}\n   \\]\n\n3. Each vehicle takes up 1 space. Therefore, the number of vehicles that can still park in the remaining 24 spaces is:\n   \\[\n   24 \\text{ spaces} \\div 1 \\text{ space per vehicle} = 24 \\text{ vehicles}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the number of vehicles that can still park is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",

Determine how many vehicles can park in the remaining spaces.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of parking spaces occupied by the caravans. Since each caravan takes up 2 spaces and there are 3 caravans, we multiply the number of caravans by the number of spaces each caravan occupies:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ caravans} \\times 2 \\text{ spaces per caravan} = 6 \\text{ spaces}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of occupied spaces from the total number of parking spaces to find out how many spaces are left:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ total spaces} - 6 \\text{ occupied spaces} = 24 \\text{ spaces left}\n\\]\n\nSince each vehicle takes up 1 space, the number of vehicles that can still park is equal to the number of spaces left:\n\\[\n24 \\text{ spaces left} = 24 \\text{ vehicles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of vehicles that can still park is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
