        "To determine how much candy Neil collected on Halloween, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much candy Harper collected.\n2. Use Harper's total to calculate how much candy Neil collected.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Harper's total candy.**\n\nMaggie collected 50 pieces of candy. Harper collected 30% more than Maggie. To find out how much more candy Harper collected, we calculate 30% of Maggie's total:\n\n\\[\n0.30 \\times 50 = 15\n\\]\n\nAdding this to Maggie's total gives us Harper's total:\n\n\\[\n50 + 15 = 65\n\\]\n\nSo, Harper collected 65 pieces of candy.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Neil's total candy.**\n\nNeil collected 40% more candy than Harper. To find out how much more candy Neil collected, we calculate 40% of Harper's total:\n\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 65 = 26\n\\]\n\nAdding this to Harper's total gives us Neil's total:\n\n\\[\n65 + 26 = 91\n\\]\n\nSo, Neil collected 91 pieces of candy.\n\nTherefore, the amount of candy Neil got on Halloween is \\(\\boxed{91}\\).",
        "To determine how much candy Neil collected on Halloween, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of candy Harper collected.\n2. Use Harper's amount to find out how much candy Neil collected.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of candy Harper collected. Harper collected 30% more pieces of candy than Maggie, who collected 50 pieces. Therefore, we can express the amount of candy Harper collected as:\n\\[ \\text{Harper's candy} = 50 + 0.30 \\times 50 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Harper's candy} = 50 + 15 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Harper's candy} = 65 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of candy Neil collected.
