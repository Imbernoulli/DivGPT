        "To determine how much more money Emir needs to buy all three books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. The cost of the dictionary is $5, the cost of the dinosaur book is $11, and the cost of the children's cookbook is $5. Adding these amounts together gives:\n\n\\[ 5 + 11 + 5 = 21 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost of the three books is $21. Emir has saved $19 from his allowance. To find out how much more money Emir needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost of the books:\n\n\\[ 21 - 19 = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, Emir needs \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more dollars to buy all three books."
