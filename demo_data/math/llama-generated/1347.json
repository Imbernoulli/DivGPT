The time \\( t_{\\text{up}} \\) can be found using the formula:\n\\[\nt_{\\text{up}} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{900 \\text{ feet}}{9 \\text{ feet/second}} = 100 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes Jill to run down the hill. The hill is again 900 feet long, and her running speed down the hill is 12 feet per second. The time \\( t_{\\text{down}} \\) can be found using the formula:\n\\[\nt_{\\text{down}} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{900 \\text{ feet}}{12 \\text{ feet/second}} = 75 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the time it takes to run up the hill and the time it takes to run down the hill to find the total time \\( t_{\\text{total}} \\):\n\\[\nt_{\\text{total}} = t_{\\text{up}} + t_{\\text{down}} = 100 \\text{ seconds} + 75 \\text{ seconds} = 175 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes Jill to run up and down a 900-foot hill is \\(\\boxed{175}\\) seconds.",
        "To determine the total time Jill takes to run up and down a 900-foot hill, we need to calculate the time taken for each segment of her run separately and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time it takes Jill to run up the hill:\n- The distance up the hill is 900 feet.\n- Jill's running speed up the hill is 9 feet per second.\n\nUsing the formula for time, \\( \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\), we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Time up the hill} = \\frac{900 \\text{ feet}}{9 \\text{ feet/second}} = 100 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the time it takes Jill to run down the hill:\n- The distance down the hill is 900 feet.\n- Jill's running speed down the hill is 12 feet per second.\n\nAgain, using the formula for time, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Time down the hill} = \\frac{900 \\text{ feet}}{12 \\text{ feet/second}} = 75 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the times for both segments to find the total time:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\text{Time up the hill} + \\text{Time down the hill} = 100 \\text{ seconds} + 75 \\text{ seconds} = 175 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time it takes Jill to run up and down a 900-foot hill is \\boxed{175} seconds.",
