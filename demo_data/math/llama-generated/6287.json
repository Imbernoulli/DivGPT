She bakes 20 cakes each day, so we multiply 20 by 9:\n\\[\n20 \\times 9 = 180\n\\]\nSo, Brenda bakes 180 cakes in 9 days.\n\nNext, she sells half of the cakes. To find out how many cakes she sells, we divide 180 by 2:\n\\[\n180 \\div 2 = 90\n\\]\nSo, Brenda sells 90 cakes.\n\nFinally, to find out how many cakes are left with Brenda, we subtract the number of cakes she sold from the total number of cakes she baked:\n\\[\n180 - 90 = 90\n\\]\nSo, the number of cakes left with Brenda is \\boxed{90}.",
