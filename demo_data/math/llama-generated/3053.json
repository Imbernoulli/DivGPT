Since there is 1 lion that dies each month, the total number of lions that die in one year is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ lion/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months} = 12 \\text{ lions} \\]\n\nThe net change in the lion population over one year is the number of lions born minus the number of lions that die:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ lions} - 12 \\text{ lions} = 48 \\text{ lions} \\]\n\nSince we started with 100 lions, the total number of lions after one year is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ lions} + 48 \\text{ lions} = 148 \\text{ lions} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of lions in Londolozi after 1 year is \\(\\boxed{148}\\).",
