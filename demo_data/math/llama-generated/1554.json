        "To determine how many driveways Jimmy shoveled, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he spent at the candy store.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of the candy bars:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ candy bars} \\times \\$0.75 \\text{ per candy bar} = \\$1.50\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the lollipops:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ lollipops} \\times \\$0.25 \\text{ per lollipop} = \\$1.00\n\\]\n\nAdding the cost of the candy bars and the lollipops gives us the total amount of money Jimmy spent:\n\\[\n\\$1.50 + \\$1.00 = \\$2.50\n\\]\n\nWe know that the \\$2.50 Jimmy spent is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of the money he earned from shoveling snow. Let \\( E \\) be the total amount of money Jimmy earned. Then we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} E = \\$2.50\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( E \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 6:\n\\[\nE = \\$2.50 \\times 6 = \\$15.00\n\\]\n\nJimmy earns \\$1.50 per driveway. To find out how many driveways he shoveled, we divide the total amount of money he earned by the amount he earns per driveway:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of driveways} = \\frac{\\$15.00}{\\$1.50 \\text{ per driveway}} = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of driveways Jimmy shoveled is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "To determine how many driveways Jimmy shoveled, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the candy bars:**\n   Jimmy buys 2 candy bars, each costing $0.75.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 0.75 = 1.50\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the candy bars is $1.50.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the lollipops:**\n   Jimmy buys 4 lollipops, each costing $0.25.\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 0.25 = 1.00\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the lollipops is $1.00.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**\n   Add the cost of the candy bars and the cost of the lollipops.\n   \\[\n   1.50 + 1.00 = 2.50\n   \\]\n   So, Jimmy spent $2.50 in total.\n\n4. **Determine the total amount of money Jimmy earned:**\n   Jimmy spent \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of the money he earned.

The total amount of money Jimmy spent is:\n   \\[\n   \\$1.50 + \\$1.00 = \\$2.50\n   \\]\n\n4. Since the total amount spent is 1/6 of his earnings, we can find his total earnings by multiplying the total amount spent by 6:\n   \\[\n   \\$2.50 \\times 6 = \\$15.00\n   \\]\n\n5. If Jimmy charges \\$1.5 per driveway, the number of driveways he shoveled is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$15.00}{\\$1.5 \\text{ per driveway}} = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of driveways Jimmy shoveled is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
