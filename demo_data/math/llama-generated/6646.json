        "To determine how long it will take Tom to make back his initial investment, we need to calculate both his daily expenses and his daily revenue, and then find out how many days it will take for his net profit to equal his initial cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Tom's daily expenses. The initial cost to open the park is $100,000, and it costs 1% of that to run per day. Therefore, the daily running cost is:\n\\[\n100,000 \\times 0.01 = 1,000 \\text{ dollars per day}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate Tom's daily revenue. He sells 150 tickets each day for $10 each. Therefore, the daily revenue is:\n\\[\n150 \\times 10 = 1,500 \\text{ dollars per day}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find out Tom's daily net profit. This is the daily revenue minus the daily expenses:\n\\[\n1,500 - 1,000 = 500 \\text{ dollars per day}\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many days it will take Tom to make back his initial investment of $100,000, we divide the initial cost by the daily net profit:\n\\[\n100,000 \\div 500 = 200 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Tom \\boxed{200} days to make back his money.",
