        "To determine how many more minutes Maddie watched over the weekend, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes she watched during the week and then subtract that from the total number of minutes she watched for the entire week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of minutes Maddie watched for the entire week. She watched 8 episodes, and each episode is 44 minutes long:\n\\[\n8 \\times 44 = 352 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of minutes she watched during the week. She watched 138 minutes on Monday, 0 minutes on Tuesday and Wednesday, 21 minutes on Thursday, and 2 episodes on Friday. Since each episode is 44 minutes long, she watched \\(2 \\times 44 = 88\\) minutes on Friday. Adding these amounts together, we get:\n\\[\n138 + 0 + 0 + 21 + 88 = 247 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of minutes she watched during the week from the total number of minutes she watched for the entire week to find out how many more minutes she watched over the weekend:\n\\[\n352 - 247 = 105 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of minutes Maddie watched over the weekend is \\(\\boxed{105}\\).",
