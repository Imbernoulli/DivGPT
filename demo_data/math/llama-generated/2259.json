        "To determine the total number of students at Texas Integrated School after adding five more classes, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students in the original 15 classes.\n2. Calculate the total number of students in the additional 5 classes.\n3. Add the number of students from the original classes to the number of students in the additional classes.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of students in the original 15 classes:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ classes} \\times 20 \\text{ students per class} = 300 \\text{ students} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of students in the additional 5 classes:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ classes} \\times 20 \\text{ students per class} = 100 \\text{ students} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of students from the original classes to the number of students in the additional classes:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ students} + 100 \\text{ students} = 400 \\text{ students} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students at Texas Integrated School now is \\(\\boxed{400}\\).",
