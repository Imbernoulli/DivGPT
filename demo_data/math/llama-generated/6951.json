        "To determine how much money Claudia makes over the weekend, we need to calculate the total revenue from both Saturday's and Sunday's classes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the revenue for Saturday's class:\n- Number of kids attending Saturday's class: 20\n- Cost per class: $10.00\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from Saturday's class} = 20 \\text{ kids} \\times \\$10.00/\\text{kid} = \\$200\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue for Sunday's class:\n- Number of kids attending Sunday's class: half of Saturday's class\n- Number of kids attending Sunday's class: \\(\\frac{20}{2} = 10\\)\n- Cost per class: $10.00\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from Sunday's class} = 10 \\text{ kids} \\times \\$10.00/\\text{kid} = \\$100\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the revenue from both days to find the total revenue for the weekend:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total revenue} = \\$200 + \\$100 = \\$300\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Claudia makes over the weekend is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",

Therefore, the number of kids on Sunday is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n  \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the earnings for each day:\n- On Saturday, Claudia charges $10.00 per kid and 20 kids attend. So, her earnings on Saturday are:\n  \\[\n  20 \\times 10 = 200\n  \\]\n- On Sunday, Claudia charges $10.00 per kid and 10 kids attend.
