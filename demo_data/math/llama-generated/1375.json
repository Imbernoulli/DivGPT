Kate bought 3 magic wands, so the total cost she paid for the wands is \\( 3x \\) dollars.\n\nWhen she sold the wands to her friends, she sold each wand for \\( x + 5 \\) dollars. Since she sold two wands, the total amount she received from selling the wands is \\( 2(x + 5) \\) dollars. According to the problem, she collected $130 after the sale. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 2(x + 5) = 130 \\]\n\nFirst, we need to expand the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x + 10 = 130 \\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate the term with \\( x \\) by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x = 120 \\]\n\nThen, we need to solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ x = 60 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of each wand is \\(\\boxed{60}\\) dollars."
