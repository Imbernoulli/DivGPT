        "To determine how many cans of pie filling the pumpkin patch will produce, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pumpkins sold.\n2. Determine the number of pumpkins remaining.\n3. Convert the remaining pumpkins into cans of pie filling.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of pumpkins sold.**\n\nThe pumpkin patch charges $3 per person and made $96 from selling pumpkins. To find out how many pumpkins were sold, we divide the total revenue by the price per pumpkin:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pumpkins sold} = \\frac{96}{3} = 32\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of pumpkins remaining.**\n\nThe pumpkin patch grew 83 pumpkins and sold 32 pumpkins. To find out how many pumpkins are remaining, we subtract the number of pumpkins sold from the total number of pumpkins grown:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pumpkins remaining} = 83 - 32 = 51\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert the remaining pumpkins into cans of pie filling.**\n\nEach can of pie filling requires 3 pumpkins. To find out how many cans of pie filling can be made from the remaining pumpkins, we divide the number of remaining pumpkins by the number of pumpkins per can:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cans of pie filling} = \\frac{51}{3} = 17\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the pumpkin patch will produce \\boxed{17} cans of pie filling.",
