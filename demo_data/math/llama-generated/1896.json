Therefore, the total number of training hours required is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ dolphins} \\times 3 \\text{ hours/dolphin} = 12 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Divide the total number of training hours by the number of trainers.**\n\nThe aquarium has 2 trainers, and they want to split the training hours equally. Therefore, the number of hours each trainer will spend training the dolphins is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ hours} \\div 2 \\text{ trainers} = 6 \\text{ hours/trainer} \\]\n\nSo, each trainer will spend \\(\\boxed{6}\\) hours training the dolphins.",
