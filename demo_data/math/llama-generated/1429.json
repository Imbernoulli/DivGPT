        "To determine the number of $20 bills in Karen's class fund, we start by defining variables for the number of each type of bill. Let's denote the number of $20 bills as \\( x \\).

Let's define the variables as follows:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of $20 bills.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of $10 bills.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. The total value of the bills is $120.\n2. The number of $10 bills is twice the number of $20 bills.\n\nWe can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:\n1. \\( 20x + 10y = 120 \\)\n2. \\( y = 2x \\)\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \\( y \\):\n\\[ 20x + 10(2x) = 120 \\]\n\\[ 20x + 20x = 120 \\]\n\\[ 40x = 120 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 40:\n\\[ x = \\frac{120}{40} \\]\n\\[ x = 3 \\]\n\nSo, the number of $20 bills is \\( x = 3 \\).\n\nTo verify, we can find the number of $10 bills using the second equation:\n\\[ y = 2x = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6 \\]\n\nWe check the total value of the bills:\n\\[ 20x + 10y = 20 \\cdot 3 + 10 \\cdot 6 = 60 + 60 = 120 \\]\n\nThe total value is correct, confirming that our solution is correct. Therefore, the number of $20 bills is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
        "To determine the number of $20 bills Karen's class fund contains, we start by defining variables for the quantities of each type of bill. Let \\( x \\) represent the number of $20 bills.
