        "To determine the total number of points Lemuel made in the game, we need to calculate the points from his 2-point shots and his 3-point shots separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the points from the 2-point shots:\nLemuel made 2-point shots 7 times. Since each 2-point shot is worth 2 points, we multiply the number of 2-point shots by 2:\n\\[ 7 \\times 2 = 14 \\]\nSo, Lemuel scored 14 points from the 2-point shots.\n\nNext, let's calculate the points from the 3-point shots:\nLemuel made 3-point shots 3 times. Since each 3-point shot is worth 3 points, we multiply the number of 3-point shots by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\nSo, Lemuel scored 9 points from the 3-point shots.\n\nNow, we add the points from the 2-point shots and the points from the 3-point shots to find the total points scored:\n\\[ 14 + 9 = 23 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of points Lemuel made in the game is \\(\\boxed{23}\\).",
