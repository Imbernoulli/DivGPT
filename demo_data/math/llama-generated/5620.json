Calculate the price after the second reduction.\n3. Determine the total reduction from the original price.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the price after the first reduction.**\n\nThe original price of the bag is $500. The first reduction is 5%. To find the price after the first reduction, we calculate 5% of $500 and subtract it from the original price.\n\\[ 5\\% \\text{ of } 500 = 0.05 \\times 500 = 25 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Price after the first reduction} = 500 - 25 = 475 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the price after the second reduction.**\n\nThe price after the first reduction is $475. The second reduction is 4%. To find the price after the second reduction, we calculate 4% of $475 and subtract it from the price after the first reduction.\n\\[ 4\\% \\text{ of } 475 = 0.04 \\times 475 = 19 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Price after the second reduction} = 475 - 19 = 456 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total reduction from the original price.**\n\nThe original price of the bag is $500, and the final price after both reductions is $456. The total reduction is the difference between the original price and the final price.\n\\[ \\text{Total reduction} = 500 - 456 = 44 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total reduction from the original selling price is \\(\\boxed{44}\\).",
