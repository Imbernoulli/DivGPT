        "To determine how many carrots were not used that day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of carrots used before lunch:**\n   The cook started with 300 carrots. Before lunch, he used \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the carrots.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Carrots used before lunch} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 300 = \\frac{2 \\times 300}{5} = \\frac{600}{5} = 120\n   \\]\n   So, 120 carrots were used before lunch.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of carrots remaining after lunch:**\n   After using 120 carrots, the number of carrots left is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Carrots remaining after lunch} = 300 - 120 = 180\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of carrots used by the end of the day:**\n   By the end of the day, the cook used \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the remaining carrots.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Carrots used by the end of the day} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 180 = \\frac{3 \\times 180}{5} = \\frac{540}{5} = 108\n   \\]\n   So, 108 carrots were used by the end of the day.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of carrots used during the day:**\n   The total number of carrots used during the day is the sum of the carrots used before lunch and the carrots used by the end of the day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total carrots used} = 120 + 108 = 228\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of carrots not used:**\n   The number of carrots not used is the initial number of carrots minus the total number of carrots used.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Carrots not used} = 300 - 228 = 72\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of carrots that were not used that day is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).",

Since there were 180 carrots remaining after lunch, the number of carrots used by the end of the day is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 180 = \\frac{3 \\times 180}{5} = \\frac{540}{5} = 108\n\\]\nSo, 108 carrots were used by the end of the day.\n\n**Step 4: Find out how many carrots were not used that day.**\n\nThe total number of carrots used that day is the sum of the carrots used before lunch and the carrots used by the end of the day:\n\\[\n120 + 108 = 228\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of carrots that were not used that day is:\n\\[\n300 - 228 = 72\n\\]\nSo, the number of carrots not used that day is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).",
