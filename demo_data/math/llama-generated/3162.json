        "To determine the depth of Sarah's pool, we start by setting up an equation based on the information given in the problem. Let's denote the depth of Sarah's pool by \\( s \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, John's pool is 5 feet deeper than 2 times Sarah's pool. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\text{Depth of John's pool} = 2s + 5 \\]\n\nWe are also given that John's pool is 15 feet deep. Therefore, we can substitute 15 for the depth of John's pool in the equation:\n\\[ 15 = 2s + 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve this equation for \\( s \\).
