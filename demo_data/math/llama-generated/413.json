        "To determine how much James was out of pocket, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the selling price of the old car:**\n   James sold his $20,000 car for 80% of its value. To find 80% of $20,000, we multiply:\n   \\[\n   20,000 \\times 0.80 = 16,000\n   \\]\n   So, James sold his car for $16,000.\n\n2. **Calculate the buying price of the new car:**\n   James bought a $30,000 car for 90% of its value. To find 90% of $30,000, we multiply:\n   \\[\n   30,000 \\times 0.90 = 27,000\n   \\]\n   So, James bought his car for $27,000.\n\n3. **Determine the net out-of-pocket cost:**\n   To find out how much James was out of pocket, we subtract the amount he received from selling the old car from the amount he paid for the new car:\n   \\[\n   27,000 - 16,000 = 11,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, James was out of pocket \\(\\boxed{11000}\\).",
