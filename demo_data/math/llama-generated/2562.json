        "To determine how much Bob pays for the nose spray, we need to consider the \"buy one get one free\" promotion. This means that for every two nose sprays he buys, he only pays for one.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many pairs of nose sprays Bob gets:\n\\[ \\text{Number of pairs} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of nose sprays}}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\]\n\nSince each pair costs the price of one nose spray, and each nose spray costs $3, the cost for each pair is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost per pair} = \\$3 \\]\n\nNext, we find the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs by the cost per pair:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Number of pairs} \\times \\text{Cost per pair} = 5 \\times \\$3 = \\$15 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Bob pays is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]",

        "To determine how much Bob pays for the nose spray, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Promotion**: The promotion is \"buy one get one free.\" This means for every nose spray Bob buys, he gets another one for free.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of contests Bob Pays For**: Bob buys 10 nose sprays. Since he gets one free for each one he buys, he only pays for half of the nose sprays.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of nose sprays Bob pays for} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Cost Per Nose spray**: Each nose spray costs $3.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Cost**: Multiply the number of nose sprays Bob pays for by the cost per nose spray.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 5 \\times 3 = 15\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Bob pays \\(\\boxed{15}\\) dollars.",
