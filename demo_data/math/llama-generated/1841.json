        "Let's start by determining how many fish Tony gets each year. Initially, Tony has 2 fish. Each year, his parents buy him 2 more fish, but one of them dies. So, the net increase in the number of fish each year is:\n\n\\[2 - 1 = 1\\]\n\nThis means that each year, Tony gains 1 fish. To find out how many fish Tony will have in five years, we need to calculate the total increase in the number of fish over these five years and add it to the initial number of fish. The total increase over five years is:\n\n\\[1 \\times 5 = 5\\]\n\nAdding this increase to the initial number of fish, we get:\n\n\\[2 + 5 = 7\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of fish Tony will have in five years is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{7}\\]",
