        "To determine the total number of books Lily will finish over the two months, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of books Lily finished last month.\n2. Calculate the number of books Lily wants to finish this month.\n3. Add the number of books finished last month to the number of books she wants to finish this month.\n\nFirst, we know that Lily finished reading 4 books last month.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many books she wants to finish this month. According to the problem, she wants to finish twice as many books as she finished last month. So, we calculate:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\nThis means Lily wants to finish 8 books this month.\n\nNow, we add the number of books she finished last month to the number of books she wants to finish this month:\n\\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of books that Lily will finish for the two months is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
