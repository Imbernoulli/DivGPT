        "To determine how many more dollars a pint of strawberries costs when not on sale, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the sale price per pint of strawberries.\n2. Determine the regular price per pint of strawberries.\n3. Find the difference between the regular price and the sale price.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sale price per pint. The supermarket sold 54 pints and made $216. Therefore, the sale price per pint is:\n\\[\n\\text{Sale price per pint} = \\frac{216}{54} = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the regular price per pint. We know that the supermarket made $216 when selling 54 pints without the sale, but this amount was $108 less than what they would have made with the sale. Therefore, the total revenue without the sale would have been:\n\\[\n216 + 108 = 324 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nThe regular price per pint is:\n\\[\n\\text{Regular price per pint} = \\frac{324}{54} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the regular price and the sale price:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 6 - 4 = 2 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, a pint of strawberries costs \\(\\boxed{2}\\) dollars more when not on sale.",
