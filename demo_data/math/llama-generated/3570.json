        "To determine how much protein powder Matt needs to eat per week, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Matt's daily protein requirement:**\n   Matt wants to eat 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day. Since he weighs 80 kg, we can calculate his daily protein requirement as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily protein requirement} = 2 \\, \\text{grams/kg} \\times 80 \\, \\text{kg} = 160 \\, \\text{grams}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the amount of protein powder needed per day:**\n   Matt's protein powder is 80% protein. This means that 80 grams of protein powder contains 64 grams of protein (since \\( 80\\% \\times 80 = 64\\)). To find out how much protein powder is needed to get 160 grams of protein, we set up a proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Amount of protein powder}}{160 \\, \\text{grams of protein}} = \\frac{80 \\, \\text{grams of protein powder}}{64 \\, \\text{grams of protein}}\n   \\]\n   Solving for the amount of protein powder, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount of protein powder per day} = \\frac{160 \\, \\text{grams of protein} \\times 80 \\, \\text{grams of protein powder}}{64 \\, \\text{grams of protein}} = 200 \\, \\text{grams}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the amount of protein powder needed per week:**\n   Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily amount of protein powder by 7:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount of protein powder per week} = 200 \\, \\text{grams/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days} = 1400 \\, \\text{grams}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Matt needs to eat \\(\\boxed{1400}\\) grams of protein powder per week.",
        "To determine how much protein powder Matt needs to eat per week, we can break the problem down into a few steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the daily protein requirement:**\n   Matt wants to eat 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day. Since he weighs 80 kg, we can calculate his daily protein requirement as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily protein requirement} = 2 \\, \\text{grams/kg} \\times 80 \\, \\text{kg} = 160 \\, \\text{grams}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the amount of protein powder needed per day:**\n   Matt's protein powder is 80% protein. This means that for every 100 grams of protein powder, 80 grams are protein. To find out how much protein powder Matt needs to consume each day to meet his protein requirement, we can set up a proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{80 \\, \\text{grams of protein}}{100 \\, \\text{grams of protein powder}} = \\frac{160 \\, \\text{grams of protein}}{x \\, \\text{grams of protein powder}}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{160 \\, \\text{grams of protein} \\times 100 \\, \\text{grams of protein powder}}{80 \\, \\text{grams of protein}} = \\frac{16000}{80} = 200 \\, \\text{grams of protein powder}\n   \\]\n   So, Matt needs to eat 200 grams of protein powder each day.\n\n3. **Calculate the weekly protein powder consumption:**\n   Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the weekly protein powder consumption by multiplying the daily amount by 7:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly protein powder consumption} = 200 \\, \\text{grams/day} \\times 7 \\, \\text{days/week} = 1400 \\, \\text{grams/week}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Matt needs to eat \\(\\boxed{1400}\\) grams of protein powder per week.",

This means that for every 100 grams of protein powder, 80 grams is protein. To find out how much protein powder is needed to get 1120 grams of protein, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\text{Amount of protein powder} = \\frac{1120 \\, \\text{grams of protein}}{80 \\, \\text{grams of protein/100 grams of protein powder}} = \\frac{1120 \\, \\text{grams of protein}}{0.8 \\, \\text{grams of protein/gram of protein powder}} = 1400 \\, \\text{grams of protein powder} \\]\n\nTherefore, Matt needs to eat \\(\\boxed{1400}\\) grams of protein powder per week.",
