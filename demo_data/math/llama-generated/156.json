Therefore, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ pizzas} \\times 6 \\text{ slices per pizza} = 12 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many slices Mrs. Kaplan has. Since Mrs. Kaplan has 1/4 as many pizza slices as Bobby, we multiply the total number of slices Bobby has by 1/4:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ slices} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 3 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nSo, the number of pizza slices Mrs. Kaplan has is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
