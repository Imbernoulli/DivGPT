Typically, corn grown on good soil yields 400 bushels per acre, but in clay-rich soil, the yield is only half as much per acre as in good soil.  One-third of Jorge's 60 acres of land is clay-rich soil and the rest is good soil.  How many bushels of corn did Jorge's land yield last year?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The yield per acre of clay-rich soil is half of the yield per acre of good soil, which is:\n\\[\n\\text{Yield per acre of clay-rich soil} = \\frac{400}{2} = 200 \\text{ bushels}\n\\]\nSo, the total yield from the clay-rich soil is:\n\\[\n\\text{Yield from clay-rich soil} = 20 \\times 200 = 4000 \\text{ bushels}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the yields from the good soil and the clay-rich soil to get the total yield from Jorge's land:\n\\[\n\\text{Total yield} = 16000 + 4000 = 20000 \\text{ bushels}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total yield of corn from Jorge's land last year is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20000}\n\\]",
