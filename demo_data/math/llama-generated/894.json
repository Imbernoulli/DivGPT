        "To determine how many pesetas would be saved by buying a big bottle of mango juice instead of smaller bottles for the same volume of juice, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the mango juice per ounce for the big bottle.\n2. Calculate the cost of the mango juice per ounce for the small bottle.\n3. Determine the total cost of the mango juice if bought in small bottles for the same volume as a big bottle.\n4. Find the difference in cost between buying the big bottle and buying the small bottles for the same volume.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the mango juice per ounce for the big bottle.**\n\nThe big bottle holds 30 ounces and costs 2700 pesetas.\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per ounce for the big bottle} = \\frac{2700 \\text{ pesetas}}{30 \\text{ ounces}} = 90 \\text{ pesetas per ounce}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mango juice per ounce for the small bottle.**\n\nThe small bottle holds 6 ounces and costs 600 pesetas.\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per ounce for the small bottle} = \\frac{600 \\text{ pesetas}}{6 \\text{ ounces}} = 100 \\text{ pesetas per ounce}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total cost of the mango juice if bought in small bottles for the same volume as a big bottle.**\n\nThe big bottle holds 30 ounces. If we buy small bottles for the same volume, we need:\n\\[\n\\frac{30 \\text{ ounces}}{6 \\text{ ounces per small bottle}} = 5 \\text{ small bottles}\n\\]\nThe cost of 5 small bottles is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ small bottles} \\times 600 \\text{ pesetas per small bottle} = 3000 \\text{ pesetas}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the difference in cost between buying the big bottle and buying the small bottles for the same volume.**\n\nThe cost of the big bottle is 2700 pesetas, and the cost of 5 small bottles is 3000 pesetas. The savings is:\n\\[\n3000 \\text{ pesetas} - 2700 \\text{ pesetas} = 300 \\text{ pesetas}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pesetas saved by buying a big bottle instead of smaller bottles for the same volume of juice is \\boxed{300}.",

Since each big bottle holds 30 ounces and each small bottle holds 6 ounces, we divide the volume of the big bottle by the volume of the small bottle:\n\\[\n\\frac{30 \\text{ ounces}}{6 \\text{ ounces per small bottle}} = 5 \\text{ small bottles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of 5 small bottles. Each small bottle costs 600 pesetas, so we multiply the number of small bottles by the cost per small bottle:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ small bottles} \\times 600 \\text{ pesetas per small bottle} = 3000 \\text{ pesetas}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of the big bottle from the total cost of the small bottles:\n\\[\n3000 \\text{ pesetas} - 2700 \\text{ pesetas} = 300 \\text{ pesetas}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pesetas saved by buying a big bottle instead of smaller bottles for the same volume of juice is \\boxed{300}.",

Calculate the total cost of the small bottles needed to match the volume of one big bottle.\n2. Subtract the cost of one big bottle from the total cost of the small bottles.\n\nFirst, we find out how many small bottles are needed to match the volume of one big bottle. Since one big bottle holds 30 ounces and each small bottle holds 6 ounces, we divide the volume of the big bottle by the volume of one small bottle:\n\\[\n\\frac{30 \\text{ ounces}}{6 \\text{ ounces per small bottle}} = 5 \\text{ small bottles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of these 5 small bottles. Since each small bottle costs 600 pesetas, we multiply the number of small bottles by the cost per small bottle:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ small bottles} \\times 600 \\text{ pesetas per small bottle} = 3000 \\text{ pesetas}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the cost of one big bottle from the total cost of the small bottles to find out how many pesetas are saved:\n\\[\n3000 \\text{ pesetas} - 2700 \\text{ pesetas} = 300 \\text{ pesetas}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pesetas saved by buying a big bottle instead of smaller bottles for the same volume of juice is \\boxed{300}.",
