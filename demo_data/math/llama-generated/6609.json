        "To determine how many more candy bars Lena has than Nicole, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the number of candy bars Kevin has as \\( K \\).\n2. Define the number of candy bars Nicole has as \\( N \\).\n3. According to the problem, Kevin has 4 candy bars less than Nicole, so we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   K = N - 4\n   \\]\n4. Lena needs 5 more candy bars to have 3 times as many as Kevin. Lena currently has 16 candy bars, so we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   16 + 5 = 3K\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   21 = 3K\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( K \\), we divide both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   K = 7\n   \\]\n5.

Lena has 16 candy bars and Nicole has 11 candy bars. To find out how many more candy bars Lena has than Nicole, we subtract the number of candy bars Nicole has from the number of candy bars Lena has:\n   \\[\n   16 - 11 = 5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Lena has \\(\\boxed{5}\\) more candy bars than Nicole.",
        "To determine how many more candy bars Lena has than Nicole, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine how many candy bars Kevin has:**\n   - Lena has 16 candy bars and needs 5 more to have 3 times as many as Kevin.\n   - Therefore, if Lena had 16 + 5 = 21 candy bars, she would have 3 times as many as Kevin.\n   - Let \\( K \\) represent the number of candy bars Kevin has.

This means that if Lena had 5 more candy bars, she would have 16 + 5 = 21 candy bars, which is 3 times the number of candy bars Kevin has. So we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 21 = 3K \\]\n\nTo find \\( K \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{21}{3} = 7 \\]\n\nNow that we know Kevin has 7 candy bars, we can find out how many candy bars Nicole has by substituting \\( K \\) back into the equation \\( K = N - 4 \\):\n\n\\[ 7 = N - 4 \\]\n\nTo find \\( N \\), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ N = 7 + 4 = 11 \\]\n\nNow we know that Lena has 16 candy bars and Nicole has 11 candy bars. To find out how many more candy bars Lena has than Nicole, we subtract the number of candy bars Nicole has from the number of candy bars Lena has:\n\n\\[ 16 - 11 = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, Lena has \\(\\boxed{5}\\) more candy bars than Nicole.",
