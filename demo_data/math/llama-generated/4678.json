        "To determine how much gold Jim finds per hour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of gold in the smaller bags.\n2. Add the gold from the treasure chest and the smaller bags to find the total amount of gold.\n3. Divide the total amount of gold by the number of hours spent scuba diving.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of gold in the smaller bags. Each smaller bag has half as much gold as the treasure chest, which has 100 gold coins. Therefore, each smaller bag has:\n\\[ \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ gold coins} \\]\n\nSince there are 2 smaller bags, the total amount of gold in the smaller bags is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\text{ gold coins} \\]\n\nNext, we add the gold from the treasure chest and the smaller bags to find the total amount of gold:\n\\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \\text{ gold coins} \\]\n\nFinally, we divide the total amount of gold by the number of hours spent scuba diving to find the amount of gold Jim finds per hour:\n\\[ \\frac{200}{8} = 25 \\text{ gold coins per hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of gold Jim finds per hour is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
