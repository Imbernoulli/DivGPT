The garden is a rectangular plot 225 feet long by 125 feet wide. He also wants to have a small 3-foot wide gate to walk through and a larger 10-foot wide gate to move his gardening equipment through. How much fencing is Bob going to need to fence in his garden, taking into account the two gates?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
