        "To determine the total number of trees Randy has on his farm, we start by identifying the number of coconut trees. According to the problem, Randy has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.\n\nFirst, we calculate half the number of mango trees:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{2} = 30\n\\]\nNext, we subtract 5 from this result to find the number of coconut trees:\n\\[\n30 - 5 = 25\n\\]\nSo, Randy has 25 coconut trees. To find the total number of trees on his farm, we add the number of mango trees and the number of coconut trees:\n\\[\n60 + 25 = 85\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of trees Randy has on his farm is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{85}\n\\]",

        "To determine the total number of trees on Randy's farm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of mango trees.\n2. Calculate the number of coconut trees.\n3. Add the number of mango trees and coconut trees together.\n\nFirst, we know that Randy has 60 mango trees.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of coconut trees. According to the problem, Randy has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. We can express this mathematically as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of coconut trees} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Number of mango trees} - 5\n\\]\nSubstituting the number of mango trees (60) into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of coconut trees} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 - 5\n\\]\nCalculating the right side of the equation, we first find half of 60:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 = 30\n\\]\nThen we subtract 5 from 30:\n\\[\n30 - 5 = 25\n\\]\nSo, Randy has 25 coconut trees.\n\nNow, we add the number of mango trees and the number of coconut trees to find the total number of trees on the farm:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of trees} = \\text{Number of mango trees} + \\text{Number of coconut trees}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values we have, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of trees} = 60 + 25 = 85\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of trees on Randy's farm is \\boxed{85}."
