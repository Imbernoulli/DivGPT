        "To determine the total time James spends on his chores, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the time James spends vacuuming.\n2. Calculate the time James spends on the rest of his chores.\n3. Add the time spent vacuuming to the time spent on the rest of his chores.\n\nStep 1: Identify the time James spends vacuuming.\nJames spends 3 hours vacuuming.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the time James spends on the rest of his chores.\nJames spends 3 times as long on the rest of his chores as he does vacuuming. Therefore, we multiply the time spent vacuuming by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nStep 3: Add the time spent vacuuming to the time spent on the rest of his chores.\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} + 9 \\text{ hours} = 12 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, the total time James spends on his chores is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) hours."
