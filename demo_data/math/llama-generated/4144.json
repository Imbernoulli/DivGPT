        "To determine how many times Max won, we start by understanding the given ratio of Chloe's wins to Max's wins, which is 8:3. This means that for every 8 games Chloe wins, Max wins 3 games. We are also given that Chloe won 24 times.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many \"sets\" of 8 games are in Chloe's 24 wins. We do this by dividing 24 by 8:\n\\[\n24 \\div 8 = 3\n\\]\nThis tells us that Chloe's 24 wins represent 3 sets of the ratio 8:3. Since each set corresponds to Max winning 3 games, we multiply the number of sets by 3 to find out how many games Max won:\n\\[\n3 \\times 3 = 9\n\\]\nTherefore, Max won \\boxed{9} times.",

To find out how many times Max won, we need to determine the factor by which the ratio has been scaled up.

This factor is calculated by dividing Chloe's actual wins by her wins in the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Multiplying factor} = \\frac{24}{8} = 3\n\\]\n\nSince the ratio is 8:3, we multiply Max's wins in the ratio by the same multiplying factor to find his actual wins:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Max's actual wins} = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Max won \\boxed{9} times.",
        "To determine how many times Max won, we start by understanding the given ratio of Chloe's wins to Max's wins, which is 8:3. This means that for every 8 wins Chloe has, Max has 3 wins.\n\nWe know that Chloe won 24 times. To find out how many times Max won, we need to determine the factor by which the ratio is scaled up. We do this by dividing Chloe's actual number of wins by the number of wins in the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Scale factor} = \\frac{\\text{Chloe's actual wins}}{\\text{Chloe's wins in the ratio}} = \\frac{24}{8} = 3\n\\]\n\nSince the ratio is scaled up by a factor of 3, we also need to scale up Max's wins by the same factor. Therefore, we multiply Max's wins in the ratio by the scale factor:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Max's actual wins} = \\text{Max's wins in the ratio} \\times \\text{Scale factor} = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, Max won \\(\\boxed{9}\\) times.",

This means that for every 8 wins Chloe has, Max has 3 wins.\n\nWe are also given that Chloe won 24 times. To find out how many times Max won, we need to determine how many groups of 8 wins are in Chloe's 24 wins. We do this by dividing 24 by 8:\n\n\\[ 24 \\div 8 = 3 \\]\n\nThis tells us that Chloe's 24 wins correspond to 3 groups of 8 wins. Since the ratio of Chloe's wins to Max's wins is 8:3, Max must have won 3 groups of 3 wins. Therefore, we multiply 3 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nSo, Max won 9 times.
