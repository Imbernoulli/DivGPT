Therefore, we can find the number of broken spiral shells by dividing 52 by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of broken spiral shells} = \\frac{52}{2} = 26\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of perfect spiral shells. We know that out of the 17 perfect shells, 12 of them were not spiral. Therefore, the number of perfect spiral shells is the total number of perfect shells minus the number of perfect shells that are not spiral:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of perfect spiral shells} = 17 - 12 = 5\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the number of broken spiral shells and the number of perfect spiral shells:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 26 - 5 = 21\n\\]\n\nThus, there are \\(\\boxed{21}\\) more broken spiral shells than perfect spiral shells.",
