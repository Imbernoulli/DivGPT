Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of fruits in all five baskets:**\n   The average number of fruits per basket is 25. Since there are five baskets, the total number of fruits is:\n   \\[\n   25 \\times 5 = 125\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum the number of fruits in baskets A, B, C, and D:**\n   - Basket A contains 15 apples.\n   - Basket B contains 30 mangoes.\n   - Basket C contains 20 peaches.\n   - Basket D contains 25 pears.\n   The total number of fruits in baskets A, B, C, and D is:\n   \\[\n   15 + 30 + 20 + 25 = 90\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of bananas in basket E:**\n   Since the total number of fruits in all five baskets is 125, and the total number of fruits in baskets A, B, C, and D is 90, the number of bananas in basket E is:\n   \\[\n   125 - 90 = 35\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bananas in basket E is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",
        "To determine the number of bananas in basket E, we start by using the given information about the average number of fruits per basket. The average number of fruits per basket for the five baskets is 25. This means that the total number of fruits in all five baskets combined is:\n\n\\[ 25 \\times 5 = 125 \\]\n\nNext, we know the number of fruits in each basket except basket E. Specifically, basket A contains 15 apples, basket B contains 30 mangoes, basket C contains 20 peaches, and basket D contains 25 pears. We can find the total number of fruits in these four baskets by adding their individual amounts:\n\n\\[ 15 + 30 + 20 + 25 = 90 \\]\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of bananas in basket E. Since the total number of fruits in all five baskets is 125, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 90 + x = 125 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 90 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ x = 125 - 90 \\]\n\\[ x = 35 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bananas in basket E is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",

        "To determine the number of bananas in basket E, we start by using the information given about the average number of fruits per basket. The average number of fruits per basket for the five baskets is 25. The formula for the average is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of fruits}}{\\text{Number of baskets}}\n\\]\n\nWe know the average is 25 and there are 5 baskets, so we can substitute these values into the formula to find the total number of fruits:\n\n\\[\n25 = \\frac{\\text{Total number of fruits}}{5}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 5 gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of fruits} = 25 \\times 5 = 125\n\\]\n\nNext, we add up the number of fruits in baskets A, B, C, and D:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fruits in basket A} = 15 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Fruits in basket B} = 30 \\text{ mangoes}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Fruits in basket C} = 20 \\text{ peaches}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Fruits in basket D} = 25 \\text{ pears}\n\\]\n\nAdding these together:\n\n\\[\n15 + 30 + 20 + 25 = 90\n\\]\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of bananas in basket E. Since the total number of fruits in all five baskets is 125, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n90 + x = 125\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\) by subtracting 90 from both sides gives:\n\n\\[\nx = 125 - 90 = 35\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bananas in basket E is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",
        "To find out how many bananas are in basket E, we start by using the information given about the average number of fruits per basket.

Basket A has 15 apples, basket B has 30 mangoes, basket C has 20 peaches, and basket D has 25 pears. Let's add up the number of fruits in these four baskets:\n\n\\[ 15 + 30 + 20 + 25 = 90 \\]\n\nSince the total number of fruits in all five baskets is 125, the number of bananas in basket E must be:\n\n\\[ 125 - 90 = 35 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bananas in basket E is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",
