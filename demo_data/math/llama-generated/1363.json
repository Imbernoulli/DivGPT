Therefore, 40% of the male turtles with stripes are babies.\n   - Since 4 baby male turtles represent 40% of the male turtles with stripes, the total number of male turtles with stripes is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4}{0.4} = 10\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the total number of male turtles:**\n   - Since 10 male turtles have stripes and they represent 25% of the male turtles, the total number of male turtles is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10}{0.25} = 40\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine the total number of turtles:**\n   - Since 40% of the turtles are male, the total number of turtles is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{40}{0.4} = 100\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of turtles in the lake is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
