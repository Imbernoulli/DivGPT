        "To determine the number of cats in King Henry's kingdom, we start with the information that there are three times as many hogs as cats. We know there are 75 hogs, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of hogs} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of cats} \\]\n\nLet \\( c \\) represent the number of cats. Then we have:\n\n\\[ 75 = 3c \\]\n\nTo find \\( c \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{75}{3} = 25 \\]\n\nSo, there are 25 cats in King Henry's kingdom.\n\nNext, we need to find 60% of the number of cats. We do this by multiplying 25 by 0.60:\n\n\\[ 60\\% \\text{ of the number of cats} = 25 \\times 0.60 = 15 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find 5 less than this value:\n\n\\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, 5 less than 60% of the number of cats in King Henry's kingdom is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
