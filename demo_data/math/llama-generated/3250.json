        "To determine how much longer Frank can spend inside the corn maze without his average time exceeding 60 minutes per maze, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time Frank has already spent on all 5 corn mazes.\n2. Determine the maximum total time Frank can spend on all 5 corn mazes to keep the average at 60 minutes per maze.\n3. Find out how much longer Frank can spend on the current maze.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total time Frank has already spent on the 4 previous corn mazes. Since he finished each of these mazes in an average of 50 minutes, the total time for these 4 mazes is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 50 = 200 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we add the time he has already spent on the current maze, which is 45 minutes. So, the total time spent on all 5 mazes so far is:\n\\[ 200 + 45 = 245 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTo ensure that his average time does not exceed 60 minutes per maze, the total time spent on all 5 mazes must be less than or equal to:\n\\[ 5 \\times 60 = 300 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum additional time Frank can spend on the current maze is:\n\\[ 300 - 245 = 55 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, Frank can spend \\(\\boxed{55}\\) more minutes inside the corn maze to ensure that his average time does not go above 60 minutes per maze.",

Since the average time is the total time divided by the number of mazes, the maximum total time for 5 mazes is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 60 = 300 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nFinally, we find out how much more time he can spend on the current maze by subtracting the time he has already spent from the maximum total time:\n\\[ 300 - 245 = 55 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, Frank can spend \\(\\boxed{55}\\) more minutes inside the corn maze to ensure that his average time doesn't go above 60 minutes per maze.",

        "To determine how much longer Frank can spend in the corn maze without his average exceeding 60 minutes per maze, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time Frank has already spent on all the corn mazes.\n2. Determine the maximum total time he can spend on all the corn mazes without exceeding an average of 60 minutes per maze.\n3. Subtract the time he has already spent from the maximum total time to find out how much longer he can spend in the current maze.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Frank has already spent on all the corn mazes. He has done 4 other corn mazes and finished each in 50 minutes on average. Therefore, the total time for the 4 mazes is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 50 = 200 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nAdding the 45 minutes he has already spent in the current maze, the total time spent so far is:\n\\[ 200 + 45 = 245 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the maximum total time he can spend on all the corn mazes without exceeding an average of 60 minutes per maze. Since he has done 5 corn mazes in total, the maximum total time is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 60 = 300 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the time he has already spent from the maximum total time to find out how much longer he can spend in the current maze:\n\\[ 300 - 245 = 55 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, Frank can spend \\(\\boxed{55}\\) more minutes inside the corn maze to ensure that his average doesn't go above 60 minutes per maze.",

Find out how much more time he can spend on the current maze.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Frank has spent on the first 4 corn mazes.
