        "To determine how much longer Frank can spend inside the corn maze without his average time exceeding 60 minutes per maze, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time Frank has already spent on all 5 corn mazes.\n2. Determine the maximum total time Frank can spend on all 5 corn mazes to keep the average at 60 minutes per maze.\n3. Find out how much longer Frank can spend on the current maze.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total time Frank has already spent on the 4 previous corn mazes. Since he finished each of these mazes in an average of 50 minutes, the total time for these 4 mazes is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 50 = 200 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we add the time he has already spent on the current maze, which is 45 minutes. So, the total time spent on all 5 mazes so far is:\n\\[ 200 + 45 = 245 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTo ensure that his average time does not exceed 60 minutes per maze, the total time spent on all 5 mazes must be less than or equal to:\n\\[ 5 \\times 60 = 300 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum additional time Frank can spend on the current maze is:\n\\[ 300 - 245 = 55 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, Frank can spend \\(\\boxed{55}\\) more minutes inside the corn maze to ensure that his average time does not go above 60 minutes per maze.",

Since the average time is the total time divided by the number of mazes, the maximum total time for 5 mazes is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 60 = 300 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nFinally, we find out how much more time he can spend on the current maze by subtracting the time he has already spent from the maximum total time:\n\\[ 300 - 245 = 55 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, Frank can spend \\(\\boxed{55}\\) more minutes inside the corn maze to ensure that his average time doesn't go above 60 minutes per maze.",

Find out how much more time Frank can spend in the current maze.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Frank has already spent on the 4 previous corn mazes.

Determine the maximum total time he can spend on all 5 mazes to keep the average at or below 60 minutes.\n4. Subtract the total time spent so far from the maximum total time to find out how much longer he can spend on the current maze.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Frank has done 4 other corn mazes and finished those in 50 minutes on average. Therefore, the total time spent on the first 4 mazes is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 50 = 200 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. Frank has already spent 45 minutes on the current maze. Adding this to the total time spent on the first 4 mazes gives:\n   \\[\n   200 + 45 = 245 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. To keep the average time at or below 60 minutes per maze, the total time spent on all 5 mazes must be:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 60 = 300 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtracting the total time spent so far from the maximum total time gives:\n   \\[\n   300 - 245 = 55 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Frank can spend \\(\\boxed{55}\\) more minutes inside the corn maze to ensure that his average time does not go above 60 minutes per maze.",

Subtract the time already spent on the 4 corn mazes from the maximum total time to find out how much longer Frank can spend on the current maze.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Frank has already spent on the 4 corn mazes.

The total time spent on all 5 mazes will then be:\n\n\\[245 + x\\]\n\nWe want Frank's average time per maze to be no more than 60 minutes. The average time per maze is given by the total time spent divided by the number of mazes, which is 5. Therefore, we set up the following inequality:\n\n\\[\\frac{245 + x}{5} \\leq 60\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 5:\n\n\\[245 + x \\leq 300\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\(x\\) by subtracting 245 from both sides:\n\n\\[x \\leq 55\\]\n\nThis means that Frank can spend no more than 55 minutes more in the corn maze without his average time exceeding 60 minutes per maze.
