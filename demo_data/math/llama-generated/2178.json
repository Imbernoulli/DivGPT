        "To determine the total number of beads in Sue's necklace, we need to calculate the number of each type of bead and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Purple Beads:**\n   Sue has 7 purple beads.\n\n2. **Blue Beads:**\n   Sue has twice as many blue beads as purple beads. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 7 = 14\n   \\]\n   So, Sue has 14 blue beads.\n\n3. **Green Beads:**\n   Sue has 11 more green beads than blue beads.
