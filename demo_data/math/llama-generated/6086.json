Determine the total revenue from selling the face masks.\n3. Subtract the cost of the face masks from the total revenue to find the profit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of face masks Grover bought. Since each box contains 20 face masks and he bought 3 boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of face masks per box:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ boxes} \\times 20 \\text{ face masks/box} = 60 \\text{ face masks} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue from selling the face masks. Since each face mask is sold for $0.50, we multiply the total number of face masks by the selling price per face mask:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ face masks} \\times \\$0.50/\\text{face mask} = \\$30 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the profit by subtracting the cost of the face masks from the total revenue:\n\\[ \\$30 - \\$15 = \\$15 \\]\n\nTherefore, Grover's total profit is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",

        "To determine Grover's total profit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of face masks Grover bought.\n2. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the face masks.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the face masks from the total revenue to find the profit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of face masks Grover bought. Since each box contains 20 face masks and he bought 3 boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of face masks per box:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ boxes} \\times 20 \\text{ face masks per box} = 60 \\text{ face masks}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the face masks. Since each face mask is sold for $0.50, we multiply the total number of face masks by the price per face mask:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ face masks} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars per face mask} = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate Grover's total profit by subtracting the total cost of the face masks from the total revenue:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ dollars} - 15 \\text{ dollars} = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Grover's total profit is \\(\\boxed{15}\\)."
