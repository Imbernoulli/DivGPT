        "To determine how much Carla spent on 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discount price of one bag of mini peanut butter cups.\n2. Multiply the discount price by 2 to find the total cost for 2 bags.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discount price of one bag. The original price of each bag is $6.00, and it is 75% off. This means Carla pays 25% of the original price. We can find 25% of $6.00 by multiplying $6.00 by 0.25:\n\n\\[ 6.00 \\times 0.25 = 1.50 \\]\n\nSo, the discount price of one bag is $1.50. Since Carla bought 2 bags, we multiply the discount price by 2:\n\n\\[ 1.50 \\times 2 = 3.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, Carla spent \\(\\boxed{3.00}\\) dollars on 2 bags of candy.",

Therefore, the discount amount for each bag is:\n\\[ 6.00 \\times 0.75 = 4.50 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of each bag:\n\\[ 6.00 - 4.50 = 1.50 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total cost for 2 bags. Since each bag costs $1.50 after the discount, the total cost for 2 bags is:\n\\[ 1.50 \\times 2 = 3.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, Carla spent \\(\\boxed{3.00}\\) dollars on 2 bags of candy.",

To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal):\n\n\\[ 6.00 \\times 0.75 = 4.50 \\]\n\nThe discount amount is $4.50. To find the sale price of one bag, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:\n\n\\[ 6.00 - 4.50 = 1.50 \\]\n\nSo, the sale price of one bag is $1.50.

Since each bag costs $1.50 after the discount, the total cost for 2 bags is:\n\\[ 1.50 \\times 2 = 3.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, Carla spent \\(\\boxed{3.00}\\) on 2 bags of candy.",
