        "To determine how many miles Molly rode on her bike, we need to calculate the total number of days she rode and then multiply that by the number of miles she rode each day.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many years Molly rode her bike. Molly started riding her bike when she turned 13 and continued until she turned 16. The number of years she rode is:\n\\[ 16 - 13 = 3 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert these years into days. Since there are 365 days in a year, the total number of days she rode is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ years} \\times 365 \\text{ days/year} = 1095 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNow, we multiply the total number of days by the number of miles she rode each day, which is 3 miles:\n\\[ 1095 \\text{ days} \\times 3 \\text{ miles/day} = 3285 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of miles Molly rode on her bike is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3285} \\]",
