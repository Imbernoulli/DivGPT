        "To determine how many more cards Ann has than Anton, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many cards Heike has.\n2. Use Heike's number of cards to find out how many cards Anton has.\n3. Calculate the difference between the number of cards Ann has and the number of cards Anton has.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many cards Heike has. We know that Ann has six times as many cards as Heike. Since Ann has 60 cards, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times \\text{Heike's cards} = 60 \\]\n\nTo find Heike's cards, we divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\n\\[ \\text{Heike's cards} = \\frac{60}{6} = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Heike has 10 cards.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cards Anton has. We know that Anton has three times as many cards as Heike. Since Heike has 10 cards, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Anton's cards} = 3 \\times \\text{Heike's cards} = 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\]\n\nSo, Anton has 30 cards.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more cards Ann has than Anton. We do this by subtracting the number of cards Anton has from the number of cards Ann has:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Ann's cards} - \\text{Anton's cards} = 60 - 30 = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, Ann has \\(\\boxed{30}\\) more cards than Anton.",
        "To determine how many more cards Ann has than Anton, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find out how many cards Heike has:**\n   Ann has 60 cards, and she has six times as many cards as Heike. Let \\( H \\) represent the number of cards Heike has. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   6H = 60\n   \\]\n   To solve for \\( H \\), divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n   \\[\n   H = \\frac{60}{6} = 10\n   \\]\n   So, Heike has 10 cards.\n\n2. **Find out how many cards Anton has:**\n   Anton has three times as many cards as Heike. Since Heike has 10 cards, we can calculate the number of cards Anton has as follows:\n   \\[\n   3H = 3 \\times 10 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, Anton has 30 cards.\n\n3. **Determine how many more cards Ann has than Anton:**\n   Ann has 60 cards, and Anton has 30 cards. The difference in the number of cards between Ann and Anton is:\n   \\[\n   60 - 30 = 30\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Ann has \\(\\boxed{30}\\) more cards than Anton.",
