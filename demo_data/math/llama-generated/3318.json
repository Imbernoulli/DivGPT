        "To determine the year Karina's brother was born, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Karina's current age and use it to find her brother's current age.\n2. Determine the year Karina's brother was born based on his current age and the current year.\n\nFirst, we know that Karina was born in 1970 and she is currently 40 years old. We are also given that she is currently twice as old as her brother. Let's denote her brother's current age by \\( B \\). According to the problem, Karina's current age is twice her brother's current age, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ 40 = 2B \\]\nTo find \\( B \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ B = \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\]\nSo, Karina's brother is currently 20 years old.\n\nNext, we need to determine the year Karina's brother was born. Since Karina was born in 1970 and she is currently 40 years old, the current year is:\n\\[ 1970 + 40 = 2010 \\]\nSince her brother is currently 20 years old, he was born in:\n\\[ 2010 - 20 = 1990 \\]\nTherefore, Karina's brother was born in the year \\(\\boxed{1990}\\).",
        "To determine the year Karina's brother was born, we start by confirming Karina's current age. According to the problem, Karina was born in 1970 and she is currently 40 years old. This can be verified by calculating the difference between the current year and her birth year:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current year} = 1970 + 40 = 2010 \\]\n\nSo, the current year is 2010. Next, we know that Karina is currently twice as old as her brother. Let's denote Karina's brother's current age as \\( x \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 40 = 2x \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\]\n\nSo, Karina's brother is currently 20 years old. To find the year he was born, we subtract his current age from the current year:\n\n\\[ \\text{Year born} = 2010 - 20 = 1990 \\]\n\nThus, Karina's brother was born in the year \\(\\boxed{1990}\\).",

Let \\( B \\) represent her brother's current age. According to the problem:\n   \\[\n   40 = 2B\n   \\]\n   To find \\( B \\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, Karina's brother is currently 20 years old.\n\n3. **Determine the year Karina's brother was born:**\n   Since the current year is 2010 and her brother is 20 years old, we find the year he was born by subtracting his age from the current year:\n   \\[\n   2010 - 20 = 1990\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Karina's brother was born in \\(\\boxed{1990}\\).",
        "To determine the year Karina's brother was born, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Karina's current age.\n2. Use the information that Karina is currently twice as old as her brother to find her brother's current age.\n3. Calculate the year Karina's brother was born by subtracting his current age from the current year.\n\nFirst, we know that Karina was born in 1970 and she is currently 40 years old. Therefore, the current year is:\n\\[ 1970 + 40 = 2010 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Karina is currently twice as old as her brother. Let \\( B \\) be her brother's current age. Then:\n\\[ 40 = 2B \\]\nSolving for \\( B \\), we get:\n\\[ B = \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\]\nSo, Karina's brother is currently 20 years old.\n\nTo find the year Karina's brother was born, we subtract his current age from the current year:\n\\[ 2010 - 20 = 1990 \\]\n\nTherefore, Karina's brother was born in the year \\(\\boxed{1990}\\).",
        "To determine the year Karina's brother was born, we start by verifying Karina's current age. According to the problem, Karina was born in 1970 and she is currently 40 years old. We can check this by subtracting her birth year from the current year:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current year} = 1970 + 40 = 2010 \\]\n\nSo, the current year is 2010. Next, we know that Karina is currently twice as old as her brother. Therefore, we can find her brother's current age by dividing Karina's age by 2:\n\n\\[ \\text{Brother's age} = \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the year Karina's brother was born. Since he is currently 20 years old and the current year is 2010, we subtract his age from the current year:\n\n\\[ \\text{Brother's birth year} = 2010 - 20 = 1990 \\]\n\nThus, Karina's brother was born in the year \\(\\boxed{1990}\\).",
        "To determine the year Karina's brother was born, we start by finding Karina's current age. According to the problem, Karina was born in 1970 and is currently 40 years old. We can confirm her current age with the following calculation:\n\n\\[ 2010 - 1970 = 40 \\]\n\nThis confirms that Karina is indeed 40 years old in the year 2010. Next, we need to find out how old her brother is. The problem states that Karina is currently twice as old as her brother. Therefore, we can express her brother's age as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Brother's age} = \\frac{\\text{Karina's age}}{2} = \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\]\n\nSo, Karina's brother is currently 20 years old. To find the year he was born, we subtract his current age from the current year:\n\n\\[ \\text{Year of birth of Karina's brother} = 2010 - 20 = 1990 \\]\n\nThus, Karina's brother was born in the year \\(\\boxed{1990}\\)."
