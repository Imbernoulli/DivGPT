        "To determine the regular price of one pen, let's denote the regular price of one pen by \\( x \\) dollars.\n\nAccording to the shop's discount policy, if you buy 10 pens at the regular price, you can get the next 10 pens for half off. This means that the cost for the first 10 pens is \\( 10x \\) dollars, and the cost for the next 10 pens is \\( 10 \\times \\frac{x}{2} = 5x \\) dollars.\n\nThe total cost for 20 pens is the sum of the cost of the first 10 pens and the cost of the next 10 pens:\n\\[\n10x + 5x = 15x\n\\]\n\nWe know from the problem that the customer paid $30 for 20 pens. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n15x = 30\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 15:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{30}{15} = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the regular price of one pen is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine the regular price of one pen, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Let the regular price of one pen be \\( p \\) dollars.\n2. According to the discount usable by the customer, the first 10 pens are sold at the regular price, so the cost for the first 10 pens is \\( 10p \\) dollars.\n3. The next 10 pens are sold at half the regular price, so the cost for the next 10 pens is \\( 10 \\times \\frac{p}{2} = 5p \\) dollars.\n4. The total cost for 20 pens is the sum of the cost of the first 10 pens and the cost of the next 10 pens, which is \\( 10p + 5p = 15p \\) dollars.\n5. We know that the customer paid $30 for 20 pens, so we can set up the equation \\( 15p = 30 \\).\n6. To find the value of \\( p \\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 15: \\( p = \\frac{30}{15} = 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the regular price of one pen is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) dollars.",

This means the customer pays \\( 10p \\) for the first 10 pens and \\( 10 \\times \\frac{p}{2} = 5p \\) for the next 10 pens. Therefore, the total cost for 20 pens is:\n\n\\[ 10p + 5p = 15p \\]\n\nWe know from the problem statement that the customer paid $30 for 20 pens. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 15p = 30 \\]\n\nTo find the regular price of one pen, we solve for \\( p \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 15:\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{30}{15} = 2 \\]\n\nThus, the regular price of one pen is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) dollars.",
        "Let's denote the regular price of one pen as \\( p \\) dollars. According to the shop's discount policy, if a customer buys 10 pens at the regular price, they can get the next 10 pens for half off. Therefore, the total cost for 20 pens is calculated as follows:\n\n1. The cost for the first 10 pens is \\( 10p \\).\n2. The cost for the next 10 pens is \\( 10 \\times \\frac{p}{2} = 5p \\).\n\nAdding these two amounts gives the total cost for 20 pens:\n\\[ 10p + 5p = 15p. \\]\n\nWe know from the problem that the customer paid $30 for 20 pens. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 15p = 30. \\]\n\nTo find the regular price of one pen, we solve for \\( p \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 15:\n\\[ p = \\frac{30}{15} = 2. \\]\n\nThus, the regular price of one pen is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) dollars."
