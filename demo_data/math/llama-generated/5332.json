        "To determine how many students have both puppies and parrots, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students who have puppies.\n2. Determine what percentage of those students also have parrots.\n3. Find the actual number of students who have both puppies and parrots.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of students who have puppies. Since 80 percent of the 40 students have puppies, we multiply 40 by 0.80:\n\\[\n40 \\times 0.80 = 32\n\\]\nSo, 32 students have puppies.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these 32 students also have parrots. Since 25 percent of the students who have puppies also have parrots, we multiply 32 by 0.25:\n\\[\n32 \\times 0.25 = 8\n\\]\nTherefore, 8 students have both puppies and parrots.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",
