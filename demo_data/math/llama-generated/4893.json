        "To determine how many tubs the pharmacy is going to buy from the usual vendor, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tubs needed.\n2. Subtract the number of tubs already in storage from the total number of tubs needed to find out how many more tubs are needed.\n3. Determine how many tubs are bought from the new vendor.\n4. Subtract the number of tubs bought from the new vendor from the total number of tubs needed to find out how many tubs are bought from the usual vendor.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The total number of tubs needed is 100.\n2. The pharmacy already has 20 tubs in storage. Therefore, the number of tubs still needed is:\n   \\[\n   100 - 20 = 80\n   \\]\n3.

The number of tubs bought from the usual vendor is the total number of tubs still needed minus the number of tubs bought from the new vendor:\n   \\[\n   80 - 20 = 60\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the pharmacy is going to buy \\boxed{60} tubs from the usual vendor.",
