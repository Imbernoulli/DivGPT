        "To determine the total number of gems Tom ended up with, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial number of gems Tom gets for spending $250:**\n   The game gives 100 gems for each dollar spent. Therefore, for $250, the initial number of gems is:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 100 = 25000 \\text{ gems}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the bonus gems Tom gets:**\n   Tom gets a 20% bonus on the initial number of gems. To find out how many bonus gems he gets, we calculate 20% of 25000:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 25000 = 5000 \\text{ gems}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of gems Tom ends up with:**\n   The total number of gems is the sum of the initial number of gems and the bonus gems:\n   \\[\n   25000 + 5000 = 30000 \\text{ gems}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of gems Tom ended up with is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{30000}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of gems Tom ended up with, we can break the problem into a series of smaller steps.\n\n1. Calculate the number of gems Tom initially gets for spending $250.\n   Since the game gives 100 gems for each dollar spent, we multiply $250 by 100:\n   \\[\n   250 \\times 100 = 25000\n   \\]\n   So, Tom initially gets 25000 gems.\n\n2. Calculate the bonus gems Tom receives.\n   Tom gets a 20% bonus on the initial number of gems. To find the bonus, we multiply the initial number of gems by 20% (which is the same as multiplying by 0.20):\n   \\[\n   25000 \\times 0.20 = 5000\n   \\]\n   So, Tom receives a bonus of 5000 gems.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of gems Tom ends up with.\n   To find the total number of gems, we add the initial number of gems to the bonus gems:\n   \\[\n   25000 + 5000 = 30000\n   \\]\n   So, Tom ends up with 30000 gems.\n\nTherefore, the total number of gems Tom ended up with is \\boxed{30000}.",
