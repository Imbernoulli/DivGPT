        "To determine how long Jack spends making coffee over 24 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert gallons to ounces**: Since Jack makes coffee in gallons and drinks it in ounces, we need to convert gallons to ounces. There are 128 ounces in a gallon. Therefore, 1.5 gallons is equal to:\n   \\[\n   1.5 \\text{ gallons} \\times 128 \\text{ ounces/gallon} = 192 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n   So, each batch of coffee is 192 ounces.\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of coffee Jack drinks in 24 days**: Jack drinks 96 ounces every 2 days. Therefore, in 24 days, he drinks:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24 \\text{ days}}{2 \\text{ days/batch}} \\times 96 \\text{ ounces/batch} = 12 \\text{ batches} \\times 96 \\text{ ounces/batch} = 1152 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n   So, Jack drinks a total of 1152 ounces of coffee in 24 days.\n\n3. **Determine the number of batches Jack needs to make**: Since each batch is 192 ounces, the number of batches Jack needs to make is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1152 \\text{ ounces}}{192 \\text{ ounces/batch}} = 6 \\text{ batches}\n   \\]\n   So, Jack needs to make 6 batches of coffee.\n\n4. **Calculate the total time Jack spends making coffee**: Since it takes 20 hours to make one batch, the total time Jack spends making coffee is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ batches} \\times 20 \\text{ hours/batch} = 120 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   So, Jack spends a total of 120 hours making coffee over 24 days.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]",

Therefore, in one day, he drinks:\n\\[ \\frac{96 \\text{ ounces}}{2 \\text{ days}} = 48 \\text{ ounces/day} \\]\n\n Over 24 days, he drinks:\n\\[ 48 \\text{ ounces/day} \\times 24 \\text{ days} = 1152 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many batches of coffee Jack needs to make to meet his consumption.**\n\nEach batch of coffee is 1.5 gallons. Since there are 128 ounces in a gallon, each batch contains:\n\\[ 1.5 \\text{ gallons} \\times 128 \\text{ ounces/gallon} = 192 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nTo find out how many batches Jack needs to make, we divide the total amount of coffee he drinks by the amount each batch contains:\n\\[ \\frac{1152 \\text{ ounces}}{192 \\text{ ounces/batch}} = 6 \\text{ batches} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total time Jack spends making coffee.**\n\nIt takes Jack 20 hours to make one batch of coffee. Therefore, the total time to make 6 batches is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ batches} \\times 20 \\text{ hours/batch} = 120 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total time Jack spends making coffee over 24 days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]",
        "To determine how long Jack spends making coffee over 24 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert gallons to ounces:**\n   Jack makes each batch in gallons.
