        "To determine the total number of points the winning team scored in the fourth quarter, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **First Quarter:**\n   - The losing team had 10 points.\n   - The winning team had double the points of the losing team.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 10 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the winning team started with 20 points.\n\n2. **Second Quarter:**\n   - The winning team had 10 more points than it started with.\n   \\[\n   20 + 10 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, at the end of the second quarter, the winning team had 30 points.\n\n3. **Third Quarter:**\n   - The winning team had 20 more points than the number it had in the second quarter.\n   \\[\n   30 + 20 = 50\n   \\]\n   So, at the end of the third quarter, the winning team had 50 points.\n\n4. **Total Points in the Game:**\n   - The total points the winning team scored in the game was 80.\n\n5. **Points Scored in the Fourth Quarter:**\n   - To find the points scored in the fourth quarter, subtract the points the winning team had at the end of the third quarter from the total points.\n   \\[\n   80 - 50 = 30\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of points the winning team scored in the fourth quarter is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
        "Let's denote the points scored by the losing team in the first quarter as \\( L_1 \\). According to the problem, \\( L_1 = 10 \\). The winning team's points in the first quarter, \\( W_1 \\), is double the points of the losing team, so:\n\\[ W_1 = 2 \\times L_1 = 2 \\times 10 = 20. \\]\n\nAt the end of the second quarter, the winning team had 10 more points than it started with, so the winning team's points in the second quarter, \\( W_2 \\), is:\n\\[ W_2 = W_1 + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30. \\]\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, the winning team had 20 more points than the number it had in the second quarter, so the winning team's points in the third quarter, \\( W_3 \\), is:\n\\[ W_3 = W_2 + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50. \\]\n\nThe total points scored by the winning team in the game is 80, so the points scored by the winning team in the fourth quarter, \\( W_4 \\), is:\n\\[ W_4 = W_3 + x = 80 - W_3 = 80 - 50 = 30. \\]\n\nThus, the total number of points the winning team scored in the fourth quarter is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",
