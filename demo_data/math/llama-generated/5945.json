        "To determine the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of April, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of emails received in the first half of April. April has 30 days, so the first half of April is:\n\\[ \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSince Jimmy's father receives 20 emails per day, the total number of emails received in the first 15 days is:\n\\[ 15 \\times 20 = 300 \\text{ emails} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of emails received in the second half of April. The second half of April is also 15 days. After subscribing to the news channel, Jimmy's father receives an additional 5 emails per day, so now he receives:\n\\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \\text{ emails per day} \\]\n\nThe total number of emails received in the second 15 days is:\n\\[ 15 \\times 25 = 375 \\text{ emails} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the emails received in the first half of April to the emails received in the second half of April to get the total number of emails received in the entire month:\n\\[ 300 + 375 = 675 \\text{ emails} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of the month is:\n\\[ \\boxed{675} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of April, we need to break the problem down into two parts: the number of emails received before and after he subscribed to the news channel.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of days in April. April has 30 days.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days passed before Jimmy's father subscribed to the news channel. Since he subscribed halfway through April, we divide the total number of days in April by 2:\n\\[ \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\]\nSo, Jimmy's father subscribed to the news channel after 15 days.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of emails received in the first 15 days. Since he receives 20 emails per day, we multiply the number of days by the number of emails per day:\n\\[ 15 \\times 20 = 300 \\]\nSo, Jimmy's father received 300 emails in the first 15 days.\n\nAfter subscribing to the news channel, Jimmy's father receives an additional 5 emails per day. Therefore, he now receives:\n\\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \\]\nemails per day.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of emails received in the remaining 15 days. Since he now receives 25 emails per day, we multiply the number of days by the number of emails per day:\n\\[ 15 \\times 25 = 375 \\]\nSo, Jimmy's father received 375 emails in the last 15 days.\n\nFinally, we add the number of emails received in the first 15 days to the number of emails received in the last 15 days to find the total number of emails received in April:\n\\[ 300 + 375 = 675 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of the month is:\n\\[ \\boxed{675} \\]",
