Over two school years, each student will make:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ artworks/year} \\times 2 \\text{ years} = 16 \\text{ artworks}\n   \\]\n\n3. There are 15 students in the art club. Therefore, the total number of artworks made by all students in two school years is:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ students} \\times 16 \\text{ artworks/student} = 240 \\text{ artworks}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of artworks the art club can collect in two school years is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",
