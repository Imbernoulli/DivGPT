        "To determine the total number of stamps in Stella's album, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the number of stamps on the first 10 pages and the number of stamps on the remaining pages.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of stamps on the first 10 pages. Each of these pages has 5 rows of 30 stamps. Therefore, the number of stamps on each page is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 30 = 150 \\]\nSince there are 10 pages, the total number of stamps on the first 10 pages is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 150 = 1500 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of stamps on the remaining pages. Stella has a total of 50 pages, and she has already counted 10 pages. Therefore, the number of remaining pages is:\n\\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \\]\nEach of these remaining pages has 50 stamps. Therefore, the total number of stamps on the remaining 40 pages is:\n\\[ 40 \\times 50 = 2000 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of stamps on the first 10 pages to the number of stamps on the remaining 40 pages to get the total number of stamps in Stella's album:\n\\[ 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of stamps in Stella's album is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3500} \\]",
