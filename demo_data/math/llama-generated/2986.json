        "To determine how much Rikki can earn in 2 hours, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of words Rikki can write in one hour.\n2. Determine the total number of words Rikki can write in 2 hours.\n3. Calculate Rikki's earnings based on the total number of words he writes.\n\nFirst, we know that Rikki can write 25 words in 5 minutes. To find out how many words he can write in one hour, we need to determine how many 5-minute intervals are in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 60 by 5:\n\n\\[ \\frac{60}{5} = 12 \\]\n\nSo, there are 12 intervals of 5 minutes in one hour. Since he writes 25 words in each interval, we multiply 25 by 12 to find out how many words he can write in one hour:\n\n\\[ 25 \\times 12 = 300 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many words he can write in 2 hours. Since he writes 300 words in one hour, we multiply 300 by 2:\n\n\\[ 300 \\times 2 = 600 \\]\n\nNow, we know that Rikki writes 600 words in 2 hours. Since he earns $0.01 for each word, we multiply 600 by $0.01 to find out his total earnings:\n\n\\[ 600 \\times 0.01 = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, Rikki can expect to earn \\(\\boxed{6}\\) dollars.",
