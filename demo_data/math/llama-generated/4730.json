        "To determine how many hours the hot dog stand needs to run to make $200 in sales, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the rate at which the hot dog stand sells hot dogs. The stand sells 10 hot dogs every hour.\n2. Identify the price of each hot dog. Each hot dog sells for $2.\n3. Calculate the total revenue generated per hour. This is done by multiplying the number of hot dogs sold per hour by the price of each hot dog:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ hot dogs/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/hot dog} = 20 \\text{ dollars/hour}\n   \\]\n4. Determine the total revenue needed. The stand needs to make $200 in sales.\n5. Calculate the number of hours required to generate $200 in sales. This is done by dividing the total revenue needed by the revenue generated per hour:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{200 \\text{ dollars}}{20 \\text{ dollars/hour}} = 10 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the stand needs to run for \\boxed{10} hours to make $200 in sales.",
