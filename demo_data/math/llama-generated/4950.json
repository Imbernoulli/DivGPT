        "To determine how much more profit is made by spending the extra money to build the house, we need to calculate the profit for both the standard house and the expanded house, and then find the difference between the two profits.\n\nFirst, let's find the construction cost of the standard house. We know that the standard house sells for $320,000. Let's denote the construction cost of each standard house as \\( C \\). According to the problem, the jewelry house costs $100,000 more to build than the standard house. Therefore, the construction cost of the jewelry house is \\( C + 100,000 \\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the profit from selling the standard house. The profit is the selling price minus the construction cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Profit from standard house} = 320,000 - C\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the profit from selling the jewelry house. The jewelry house sells for 1.5 times as much as the standard house, which is:\n\\[\n1.5 \\times 320,000 = 480,000\n\\]\nThe profit from selling the jewelry house is the selling price minus the construction cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Profit from jewelry house} = 480,000 - (C + 100,000) = 480,000 - C - 100,000 = 380,000 - C\n\\]\n\nTo find out how much more profit is made by spending the extra money to build the jewelry house, we subtract the profit from the standard house from the profit from the jewelry house:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in profit} = (380,000 - C) - (320,000 - C) = 380,000 - C - 320,000 + C = 60,000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the additional profit made by spending the extra money to build the jewelry house is \\(\\boxed{60000}\\).",
