The revenue from the first 15 bags is:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ bags} \\times \\$6.00 \\text{ per bag} = \\$90.00\n\\]\nThe revenue from the remaining 5 bags is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ bags} \\times \\$4.00 \\text{ per bag} = \\$20.00\n\\]\nTherefore, the total revenue is:\n\\[\n\\$90.00 + \\$20.00 = \\$110.00\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.**\n\nThe net profit is:\n\\[\n\\$110.00 - \\$60.00 = \\$50.00\n\\]\n\nThus, Elizabeth's net profit is \\(\\boxed{50}\\)."
