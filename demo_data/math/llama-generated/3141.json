        "To determine how many seashells Leigh had, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of seashells Mimi picked up:**\n   Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we have:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 12 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, Mimi picked up 24 seashells.\n\n2. **Determine how many seashells Kyle found:**\n   Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 24 = 48\n   \\]\n   So, Kyle found 48 seashells.\n\n3. **Calculate how many seashells Leigh grabbed:**\n   Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 48 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Leigh grabbed 16 seashells.\n\nThus, the number of seashells Leigh had is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",

Therefore, the number of seashells Kyle found is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 24 = 48 \\]\n\nLeigh grabbed one-third of the seashells that Kyle found. So, we need to find one-third of 48:\n\\[ \\frac{48}{3} = 16 \\]\n\nThus, the number of seashells Leigh had is:\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]",
