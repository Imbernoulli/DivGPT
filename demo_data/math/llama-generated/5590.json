Determine the total number of trips she makes in a year.\n3. Calculate the total time spent driving in a year.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of trips Melissa makes to town each month.**\n\nMelissa drives to town twice each month.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of trips she makes in a year.**\n\nThere are 12 months in a year. Since she makes 2 trips each month, we multiply the number of trips per month by the number of months in a year:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ trips/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 24 \\text{ trips/year} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total time spent driving in a year.**\n\nEach trip takes 3 hours.

        "To determine how many hours Melissa spends driving in a year, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many hours Melissa spends driving in one month. She drives to town twice each month, and each trip takes her 3 hours to drive to town and back. Therefore, the total time spent driving in one month is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ trips/month} \\times 3 \\text{ hours/trip} = 6 \\text{ hours/month} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours she spends driving in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly driving time by 12:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ hours/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 72 \\text{ hours/year} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Melissa spends driving in a year is:\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
