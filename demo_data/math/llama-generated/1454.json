        "To determine how many marbles Albert and Allison have, we start by finding out how many marbles Angela has. We know that Allison has 28 marbles and Angela has 8 more marbles than Allison. Therefore, we calculate Angela's marbles as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Angela's marbles} = \\text{Allison's marbles} + 8 = 28 + 8 = 36\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Albert has three times as many marbles as Angela. So, we calculate Albert's marbles as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Albert's marbles} = 3 \\times \\text{Angela's marbles} = 3 \\times 36 = 108\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that Allison has 28 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles that Albert and Allison have together is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total marbles} = \\text{Albert's marbles} + \\text{Allison's marbles} = 108 + 28 = 136\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of marbles that Albert and Allison have is \\(\\boxed{136}\\).",
        "To determine how many marbles Albert and Allison have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many marbles Angela has.\n2. Use the number of marbles Angela has to find out how many marbles Albert has.\n3. Combine the number of marbles Albert has with the number of marbles Allison has.\n\nFirst, we know that Allison has 28 marbles. Angela has 8 more marbles than Allison. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Angela has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of marbles Angela has} = 28 + 8 = 36\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Albert has three times as many marbles as Angela.
