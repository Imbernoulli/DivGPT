        "To determine how many cats Brenda needs to spay, we start by defining variables for the number of cats and dogs she needs to spay. Let \\( c \\) represent the number of cats. According to the problem, Brenda needs to spay twice as many dogs as cats, so the number of dogs she needs to spay is \\( 2c \\).\n\nThe total number of animals she needs to spay is given as 21. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of animals:\n\n\\[\nc + 2c = 21\n\\]\n\nCombining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n3c = 21\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( c \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[\nc = \\frac{21}{3} = 7\n\\]\n\nThus, Brenda needs to spay \\(\\boxed{7}\\) cats.",
