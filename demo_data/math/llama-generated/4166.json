        "To determine the total amount of time Monica spent studying over the five days, we will break down her study time for each day and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **Wednesday:**\n   Monica studied for 2 hours.\n\n2. **Thursday:**\n   Monica studied three times as long as she did on Wednesday.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Friday:**\n   Monica studied half of the time she studied on Thursday.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Weekend:**\n   Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday combined.
