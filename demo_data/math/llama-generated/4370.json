Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:\n\\[ 60 + 9w = 90 + 3w \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( w \\) by first isolating the terms involving \\( w \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting \\( 3w \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 60 + 9w - 3w = 90 + 3w - 3w \\]\n\\[ 60 + 6w = 90 \\]\n\nThen, we isolate \\( w \\) by subtracting 60 from both sides:\n\\[ 60 + 6w - 60 = 90 - 60 \\]\n\\[ 6w = 30 \\]\n\nFinally, we solve for \\( w \\) by dividing both sides by 6:\n\\[ w = \\frac{30}{6} \\]\n\\[ w = 5 \\]\n\nSo, it will take \\(\\boxed{5}\\) weeks for Carol and Mike to have the same amount of money.",
        "To determine how many weeks it will take for Carol and Mike to have the same amount of money, we start by expressing their total savings as a function of the number of weeks, \\( w \\).\n\nCarol starts with $60 and saves $9 per week.
