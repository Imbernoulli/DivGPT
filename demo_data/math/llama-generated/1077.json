Calculate the time it took for the third snail to travel that distance.\n\nFirst, let's find the speed of the second snail. The second snail raced at twice the speed of the first snail. Since the first snail's speed is 2 feet per minute, the second snail's speed is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ feet per minute} \\]\n\nNext, let's find the speed of the third snail. The third snail traveled at five times the rate of speed as the second snail. Since the second snail's speed is 4 feet per minute, the third snail's speed is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ feet per minute} \\]\n\nNow, let's determine the total distance the snails traveled. The first snail took 20 minutes to race all the way up the sidewalk at a speed of 2 feet per minute.
