        "To determine the total number of cups of sugar Kara used, we first need to understand the ratio of sugar to water in the mixture. The ratio given is 1:2, which means for every 1 part of sugar, there are 2 parts of water. Therefore, the total parts in the mixture are \\(1 + 2 = 3\\).\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cups correspond to one part of the mixture. Since Kara used 84 cups in total, we divide 84 by the total number of parts in the mixture:\n\\[\n\\text{Cups per part} = \\frac{84}{3} = 28\n\\]\nThis means that each part of the mixture is 28 cups.

The ratio given is 1:2, which means for every 1 part of sugar, there are 2 parts of water. Therefore, the total parts in the mixture are:\n\n\\[ 1 + 2 = 3 \\]\n\nThis means that out of every 3 parts of the lemonade mixture, 1 part is sugar. If Kara used 84 cups to make the lemonade, then the number of cups of sugar used can be calculated by finding out what fraction of the total 84 cups corresponds to the sugar. Since sugar is 1 part out of the 3 parts, the number of cups of sugar is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 84 = 28 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cups of sugar used is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]",
