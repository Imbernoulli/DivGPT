        "To determine Harriet's current age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Peter's current age.\n2. Use the information about Peter's age in four years to find Harriet's current age.\n\nFirst, we know Peter's mother is currently 60 years old and Peter's age is currently half of his mother's age. Therefore, Peter's current age is:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that in four years, Peter will be twice as old as Harriet. Let's denote Harriet's current age as \\( H \\). In four years, Peter's age will be \\( 30 + 4 = 34 \\) and Harriet's age will be \\( H + 4 \\). According to the problem, in four years, Peter's age will be twice Harriet's age:\n\\[\n34 = 2(H + 4)\n\\]\n\nNow, we solve the equation for \\( H \\):\n\\[\n34 = 2H + 8\n\\]\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\\[\n26 = 2H\n\\]\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nH = 13\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Harriet's current age is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]",
