        "To determine how many bracelets Caitlin can make, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of small beads required for each bracelet:**\n   Each bracelet uses twice as many small beads as large beads. Given that each bracelet uses 12 large beads, the number of small beads per bracelet is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ small beads}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of beads Caitlin has:**\n   Caitlin has 528 beads, with equal amounts of large and small beads. Therefore, the number of large beads and the number of small beads are:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{528}{2} = 264 \\text{ large beads}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{528}{2} = 264 \\text{ small beads}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of bracelets Caitlin can make based on the large beads:**\n   Each bracelet requires 12 large beads. The number of bracelets Caitlin can make with 264 large beads is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{264}{12} = 22 \\text{ bracelets}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of bracelets Caitlin can make based on the small beads:**\n   Each bracelet requires 24 small beads. The number of bracelets Caitlin can make with 264 small beads is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{264}{24} = 11 \\text{ bracelets}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the limiting factor:**\n   Caitlin can only make as many bracelets as the smaller number of bracelets she can make based on either the large beads or the small beads. Therefore, the limiting factor is the number of small beads, which allows her to make 11 bracelets.\n\nThus, the number of bracelets Caitlin can make for this weekend is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]",
