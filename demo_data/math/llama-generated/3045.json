        "To determine how many letters Jacob and Nathan can write together in 10 hours, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Nathan's writing rate:**\n   Nathan writes 25 letters in one hour.\n\n2. **Determine Jacob's writing rate:**\n   Jacob writes twice as fast as Nathan. Therefore, Jacob writes:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 25 = 50 \\text{ letters per hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of letters Nathan writes in 10 hours:**\n   Nathan writes 25 letters per hour, so in 10 hours he writes:\n   \\[\n   25 \\times 10 = 250 \\text{ letters}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of letters Jacob writes in 10 hours:**\n   Jacob writes 50 letters per hour, so in 10 hours he writes:\n   \\[\n   50 \\times 10 = 500 \\text{ letters}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Add the total number of letters written by Nathan and Jacob:**\n   The total number of letters written by both in 10 hours is:\n   \\[\n   250 + 500 = 750\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of letters Jacob and Nathan can write together in 10 hours is \\boxed{750}.",

Since Jacob can write twice as fast as Nathan, we can find out how many letters Jacob writes in one hour by multiplying Nathan's writing rate by 2:\n\\[ 25 \\times 2 = 50 \\]\nSo, Jacob writes 50 letters in one hour.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of letters Jacob writes in 10 hours:\n\\[ 50 \\times 10 = 500 \\]\nSo, Jacob writes 500 letters in 10 hours.\n\nThen, we calculate the total number of letters Nathan writes in 10 hours:\n\\[ 25 \\times 10 = 250 \\]\nSo, Nathan writes 250 letters in 10 hours.\n\nFinally, we add the total number of letters written by Jacob and Nathan in 10 hours:\n\\[ 500 + 250 = 750 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of letters Jacob and Nathan can write together in 10 hours is \\(\\boxed{750}\\).",

        "To determine how many letters Jacob and Nathan can write together in 10 hours, we first need to find out how many letters Jacob can write in one hour. Since Jacob can write twice as fast as Nathan, and Nathan wrote 25 letters in one hour, Jacob can write:\n\n\\[ 25 \\times 2 = 50 \\text{ letters per hour} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of letters each of them can write in 10 hours. For Nathan, it is:\n\n\\[ 25 \\text{ letters per hour} \\times 10 \\text{ hours} = 250 \\text{ letters} \\]\n\nFor Jacob, it is:\n\n\\[ 50 \\text{ letters per hour} \\times 10 \\text{ hours} = 500 \\text{ letters} \\]\n\nTo find out how many letters they can write together in 10 hours, we add the number of letters Nathan wrote to the number of letters Jacob wrote:\n\n\\[ 250 \\text{ letters} + 500 \\text{ letters} = 750 \\text{ letters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of letters Jacob and Nathan can write in 10 hours together is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{750}\n\\]",
