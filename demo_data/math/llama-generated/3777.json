He buys a box of donuts that has 50 in total in them.  He eats 2 on the ride in because he's hungry.  When he gets to the office, the secretary takes another 4 out of the box when he's not looking.  Lastly, right before the meeting Bill sets the box down on his desk and leaves the office to take a phone call.  While Bill's away, his coworkers steal half the remaining donuts.  Bill comes back and brings the box into his meeting.  How many donuts are left in the box?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "Let's start by determining how many donuts are left in the box after each event.\n\n1. Bill starts with a box of 50 donuts.\n2. Bill eats 2 donuts on the ride in.\n   \\[\n   50 - 2 = 48\n   \\]\n   So, there are 48 donuts left.\n3. The secretary takes 4 donuts out of the box.\n   \\[\n   48 - 4 = 44\n   \\]\n   So, there are 44 donuts left.\n4.
