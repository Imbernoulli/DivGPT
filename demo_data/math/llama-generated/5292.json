        "To determine the total number of books Katy read during the summer, we need to calculate the number of books she read in each month and then sum them up.\n\n1. First, we know that Katy read 8 books in June.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Books read in June} = 8\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we know that she read twice as many books in July as she did in June. Therefore, we calculate the number of books she read in July as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Books read in July} = 2 \\times 8 = 16\n   \\]\n\n3. Then, we know that she read three fewer books in August than she did in July. Therefore, we calculate the number of books she read in August as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Books read in August} = 16 - 3 = 13\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, we sum the number of books read in June, July, and August to find the total number of books she read during the summer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total books read} = 8 + 16 + 13 = 37\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of books Katy read during the summer is \\(\\boxed{37}\\).",
