        "Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.\n\nLet the price of one apple be \\( x \\) dollars. Since 4 apples cost the same as 1 watermelon, the price of one watermelon is \\( 4x \\) dollars.\n\nWe know that the total number of fruits bought is 36, and they are evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons. Therefore, the number of each type of fruit is:\n\\[ \\frac{36}{3} = 12 \\]\n\nThe price of one orange is $0.50, so the total cost of the oranges is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 0.50 = 6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total cost of the apples is:\n\\[ 12 \\times x = 12x \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total cost of the watermelons is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 4x = 48x \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total bill is the sum of the costs of the oranges, apples, and watermelons, which is given as $66.
