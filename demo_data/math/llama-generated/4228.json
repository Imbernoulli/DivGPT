        "To determine the total number of slices of bread Ryan needs to make 5 peanut butter sandwiches, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of slices of bread required for one sandwich. Each sandwich consists of 3 slices of bread.\n2. Determine the total number of sandwiches Ryan wants to make. Ryan wants to make 5 sandwiches.\n3. Multiply the number of slices of bread per sandwich by the number of sandwiches to find the total number of slices needed.\n\nLet's perform the multiplication:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ slices/sandwich} \\times 5 \\text{ sandwiches} = 15 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nTherefore, Ryan needs \\(\\boxed{15}\\) slices of bread to make 5 peanut butter sandwiches.",
