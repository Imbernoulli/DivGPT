        "To determine the combined number of quarters and dimes Gloria has after putting aside \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the quarters, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of quarters Gloria initially has:**\n   Gloria has five times as many dimes as quarters. Given that she has 350 dimes, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of dimes} = 5 \\times \\text{Number of quarters}\n   \\]\n   Let \\( q \\) be the number of quarters.

We calculate this as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quarters put aside} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 70 = \\frac{2 \\times 70}{5} = \\frac{140}{5} = 28\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of quarters Gloria has left:**\n   After putting aside 28 quarters, the number of quarters remaining is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quarters left} = 70 - 28 = 42\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the combined total number of quarters and dimes after putting aside the quarters:**\n   Gloria still has 350 dimes. Adding the remaining quarters to the dimes gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total} = \\text{Dimes} + \\text{Quarters left} = 350 + 42 = 392\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the combined number of quarters and dimes Gloria has after putting aside \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the quarters is \\(\\boxed{392}\\).",
