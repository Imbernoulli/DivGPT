        "To determine the total number of colored pencils that Cheryl, Cyrus, and Madeline have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine how many colored pencils Cheryl has:**\n   - We know that Madeline has 63 colored pencils and that she has half as many as Cheryl.\n   - Let \\( C \\) represent the number of colored pencils Cheryl has.\n   - Therefore, we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{C}{2} = 63\n     \\]\n   - To solve for \\( C \\), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n     \\[\n     C = 63 \\times 2 = 126\n     \\]\n   - So, Cheryl has 126 colored pencils.\n\n2. **Determine how many colored pencils Cyrus has:**\n   - Cheryl has thrice as many colored pencils as Cyrus.\n   - Let \\( D \\) represent the number of colored pencils Cyrus has.\n   - Therefore, we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     C = 3D\n     \\]\n   - We already know that \\( C = 126 \\), so substitute 126 for \\( C \\):\n     \\[\n     126 = 3D\n     \\]\n   - To solve for \\( D \\), divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n     \\[\n     D = \\frac{126}{3} = 42\n     \\]\n   - So, Cyrus has 42 colored pencils.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of colored pencils:**\n   - Cheryl has 126 colored pencils.\n   - Cyrus has 42 colored pencils.\n   - Madeline has 63 colored pencils.\n   - Add these amounts together to find the total:\n     \\[\n     126 + 42 + 63\n     \\]\n   - Perform the addition step-by-step:\n     \\[\n     126 + 42 = 168\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     168 + 63 = 231\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of colored pencils that Cheryl, Cyrus, and Madeline have altogether is \\(\\boxed{231}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of colored pencils that Cheryl, Cyrus, and Madeline have altogether, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine how many colored pencils Madeline has:**\n   Madeline has 63 colored pencils, which is half of what Cheryl has. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   63 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Cheryl's pencils}\n   \\]\n   To find Cheryl's pencils, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cheryl's pencils} = 63 \\times 2 = 126\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many colored pencils Cyrus has:**\n   Cheryl has thrice as many colored pencils as Cyrus. Let \\( C \\) represent the number of colored pencils Cyrus has. We can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   126 = 3 \\times C\n   \\]\n   To find Cyrus's pencils, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   C = \\frac{126}{3} = 42\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of colored pencils:**\n   Now that we know Cheryl has 126 colored pencils, Cyrus has 42 colored pencils, and Madeline has 63 colored pencils, we add these amounts together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pencils} = 126 + 42 + 63\n   \\]\n   performing the addition:\n   \\[\n   126 + 42 = 168\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   168 + 63 = 231\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of colored pencils that Cheryl, Cyrus, and Madeline have altogether is \\(\\boxed{231}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of colored pencils that Cheryl, Cyrus, and Madeline have, we start by defining the number of colored pencils Cyrus has as \\( c \\).\n\nSince Cheryl has thrice as many colored pencils as Cyrus, Cheryl has \\( 3c \\) colored pencils.\n\nMadeline has 63 colored pencils and only half of what Cheryl has. Therefore, we can write the equation for Madeline's colored pencils as:\n\\[ 63 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3c \\]\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 63 = \\frac{3c}{2} \\]\nTo solve for \\( c \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ 126 = 3c \\]\nNext, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ c = 42 \\]\nSo, Cyrus has 42 colored pencils.

According to the problem, Cheryl has thrice as many colored pencils as Cyrus, so Cheryl has \\( 3C \\) colored pencils. Madeline has 63 colored pencils, and this is half of what Cheryl has. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 63 = \\frac{3C}{2} \\]\n\nTo find \\( C \\), we need to solve this equation. First, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ 63 \\times 2 = 3C \\]\n\\[ 126 = 3C \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( C \\) by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{126}{3} \\]\n\\[ C = 42 \\]\n\nSo, Cyrus has 42 colored pencils. Since Cheryl has thrice as many colored pencils as Cyrus, Cheryl has:\n\n\\[ 3C = 3 \\times 42 = 126 \\]\n\nWe already know that Madeline has 63 colored pencils. To find the total number of colored pencils that Cheryl, Cyrus, and Madeline have altogether, we add their individual amounts:\n\n\\[ 126 + 42 + 63 = 231 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of colored pencils they have altogether is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{231} \\]",
