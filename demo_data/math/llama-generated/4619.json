        "To determine the percentage of girls in the class after adding one boy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the new total number of students:**\n   - Initially, there are 11 boys and 13 girls.\n   - Adding 1 boy to the class changes the total number of boys to \\( 11 + 1 = 12 \\).\n   - The total number of students in the class is then \\( 12 \\) boys + \\( 13 \\) girls = \\( 25 \\) students.\n\n2. **Determine the number of girls:**\n   - The number of girls remains the same at 13.\n\n3. **Calculate the percentage of girls:**\n   - The percentage of girls is given by the ratio of the number of girls to the total number of students, multiplied by 100.\n   - This can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage of girls} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of girls}}{\\text{Total number of students}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage of girls} = \\left( \\frac{13}{25} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the division and multiplication:**\n   - First, divide 13 by 25:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{13}{25} = 0.52\n     \\]\n   - Then, multiply by 100 to convert the decimal to a percentage:\n     \\[\n     0.52 \\times 100 = 52\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of girls in the class is \\(\\boxed{52}\\).",

The percentage is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage of girls} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of girls}}{\\text{Total number of students}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nSubstituting the numbers we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage of girls} = \\left( \\frac{13}{25} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{13}{25} \\times 100\\), we can perform the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{13}{25} = 0.52\n\\]\nThen multiply by 100:\n\\[\n0.52 \\times 100 = 52\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the class that are girls is \\(\\boxed{52}\\).",
        "To determine the percentage of girls in the class after adding one boy, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial total number of students:**\n   - There are 11 boys.\n   - There are 13 girls.\n   - Total number of students initially = \\( 11 + 13 = 24 \\).\n\n2. **Add one boy to the class:**\n   - Initial number of boys = 11.\n   - Adding 1 boy = \\( 11 + 1 = 12 \\).\n   - Total number of students after adding one boy = \\( 24 + 1 = 25 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the number of girls remains the same:**\n   - Number of girls = 13.\n\n4. **Calculate the percentage of girls in the new total number of students:**\n   - Percentage of girls = \\( \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of girls}}{\\text{Total number of students}} \\right) \\times 100 \\)\n   - Substitute the values: \\( \\left( \\frac{13}{25} \\right) \\times 100 \\).\n\n5. **Perform the division and multiplication:**\n   - \\( \\frac{13}{25} = 0.52 \\)\n   - \\( 0.52 \\times 100 = 52 \\)\n\nTherefore, the percentage of girls in the class after adding one boy is \\(\\boxed{52}\\).",
        "To determine the percentage of girls in the class after adding 1 boy, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students in the class before adding the new boy.\n2. Add the new boy to the total number of students.\n3. Determine the number of girls in the class, which remains unchanged.\n4. Calculate the percentage of girls in the new total number of students.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The initial number of boys is 11 and the initial number of girls is 13. Therefore, the total number of students before adding the new boy is:\n\\[ 11 + 13 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, we add the new boy to the total number of students. So, the new total number of students is:\n\\[ 24 + 1 = 25 \\]\n\nThe number of girls remains the same, which is 13. To find the percentage of girls in the new total number of students, we use the formula for percentage:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of girls} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of girls}}{\\text{Total number of students}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\nSubstituting the numbers we have:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of girls} = \\left( \\frac{13}{25} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of girls} = 0.52 \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of girls} = 52 \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the class that are girls after adding 1 boy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{52} \\]",
