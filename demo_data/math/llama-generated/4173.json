We know that David can wash 4 windows in 10 minutes. Therefore, we can calculate the number of windows he washes per minute by dividing the number of windows by the number of minutes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{ Trout per minute} = \\frac{4 \\text{ windows}}{10 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.4 \\text{ windows per minute}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many minutes it will take David to wash all 64 windows. We do this by dividing the total number of windows by the number of windows he can wash per minute:\n\n\\[\n\\text{ Total minutes} = \\frac{64 \\text{ windows}}{0.4 \\text{ windows per minute}} = 160 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nSo, it will take David \\(\\boxed{160}\\) minutes to wash all of the windows.",
        "To determine how many minutes it will take David to wash all 64 windows, we start by finding out how long it takes him to wash one window. Since David takes 10 minutes to wash 4 windows, we can calculate the time it takes to wash one window by dividing 10 minutes by 4 windows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time per window} = \\frac{10 \\text{ minutes}}{4 \\text{ windows}} = 2.5 \\text{ minutes per window}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many minutes it will take David to wash all 64 windows. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to wash one window by the total number of windows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = 2.5 \\text{ minutes per window} \\times 64 \\text{ windows} = 160 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take David \\boxed{160} minutes to wash all of the windows.",
