        "To determine how much John can now lift, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the increase in John's squatting weight after training.\n2. Determine John's new squatting weight after training.\n3. Calculate the additional weight increase from the magical bracer.\n4. Determine John's final squatting weight after using the bracer.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the increase in John's squatting weight after training.**\n\nJohn's original squatting weight is 135 pounds. After training, he increases this by 265 pounds.\n\\[ 135 + 265 = 400 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine John's new squatting weight after training.**\n\nAfter training, John can lift 400 pounds.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the additional weight increase from the magical bracer.**\n\nThe magical bracer increases John's strength by 600%. To find out how much this is in pounds, we need to calculate 600% of 400 pounds.\n\\[ 600\\% = 6 \\text{ (since 600 divided by 100 is 6)} \\]\n\\[ 6 \\times 400 = 2400 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine John's final squatting weight after using the bracer.**\n\nAfter using the bracer, John can lift his original training weight plus the additional weight from the bracer.\n\\[ 400 + 2400 = 2800 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the final amount John can lift is \\(\\boxed{2800}\\).",
        "To determine how much John can now lift, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate John's new squat weight after training.\n2. Apply the effect of the magical bracer to this new weight.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate John's new squat weight after training.**\n\nJohn's original squat weight is 135 pounds. After training, he increased this by 265 pounds. Therefore, his new squat weight is:\n\\[ 135 + 265 = 400 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Apply the effect of the magical bracer.**\n\nThe magical bracer increases his strength by 600%. An increase of 600% means that his strength is multiplied by 7 (since 600% is equivalent to 6 times the original amount, plus the original amount, which is 6 + 1 = 7).
