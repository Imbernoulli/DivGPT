Sum up the remaining plates.\n\nLet's start with the initial number of plates:\n- Jack has 4 flower pattern plates.\n- Jack has 8 checked pattern plates.\n\nNext, Jack buys new polka dotted plates. Since he buys twice as many polka dotted plates as the number of checked plates he currently has, we calculate:\n\\[ 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\nSo, Jack buys 16 polka dotted plates.\n\nThen, Jack smashes one of the flowered plates. The number of flower pattern plates he has left is:\n\\[ 4 - 1 = 3 \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the remaining plates:\n- Flower pattern plates: 3\n- Checked pattern plates: 8\n- Polka dotted plates: 16\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[ 3 + 8 + 16 = 27 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of plates Jack has left is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{27}\n\\]",

Determine the total number of plates Jack has after buying the new plates.\n3. Subtract the number of plates Jack smashes from the total number of plates.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of polka dotted plates Jack buys. Jack buys twice as many polka dotted plates as the number of checked plates he currently has. Since he currently has 8 checked plates, the number of polka dotted plates he buys is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\n\nNext, we determine the total number of plates Jack has after buying the new plates. Initially, Jack has 4 flowered plates and 8 checked plates. After buying 16 polka dotted plates, the total number of plates is:\n\\[ 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 \\]\n\nFinally, Jack smashes one of the flowered plates. So, we subtract 1 from the total number of plates:\n\\[ 28 - 1 = 27 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of plates Jack has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{27} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of plates Jack has left after his purchases and breakages, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of plates Jack has.\n2.

Sum up the remaining plates.\n\nFirst, let's identify the initial number of plates Jack has:\n- Jack has 4 plates with a flower pattern.\n- Jack has 8 plates with a checked pattern.\n\nNext, Jack buys new polka dotted plates. The number of polka dotted plates he buys is twice the number of checked plates he currently has. Since he has 8 checked plates, the number of polka dotted plates he buys is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\n\nThen, Jack smashes one of the flowered plates. So, the number of flowered plates he has left is:\n\\[ 4 - 1 = 3 \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the remaining plates:\n- Flowered plates left: 3\n- Checked plates: 8\n- Polka dotted plates: 16\n\nThe total number of plates Jack has left is:\n\\[ 3 + 8 + 16 = 27 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of plates Jack has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{27} \\]",

        "To determine the total number of plates Jack has left, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of polka dotted plates Jack buys.\n2. Determine the number of flowered plates Jack has after smashing one.\n3. Sum up all the plates Jack has after the purchases and the smashing.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of polka dotted plates Jack buys. He buys twice as many polka dotted plates as the number of checked plates he currently has. Since he currently has 8 checked plates, the number of polka dotted plates he buys is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of flowered plates Jack has after smashing one. Initially, he has 4 flowered plates. After smashing one, he has:\n\\[ 4 - 1 = 3 \\]\n\nNow, we sum up all the plates Jack has after the purchases and the smashing. He has 3 flowered plates, 8 checked plates, and 16 polka dotted plates. Therefore, the total number of plates he has left is:\n\\[ 3 + 8 + 16 = 27 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{27} \\]",
