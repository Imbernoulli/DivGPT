        "To determine the length of the hypotenuse of the right-angle triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angle triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\\(c\\)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (\\(a\\) and \\(b\\)). The formula is:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\n\nIn this problem, the base (\\(a\\)) is 4 inches and the height (\\(b\\)) is 3 inches. We need to find the hypotenuse (\\(c\\)):\n\n\\[ c^2 = 4^2 + 3^2 \\]\n\\[ c^2 = 16 + 9 \\]\n\\[ c^2 = 25 \\]\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{25} \\]\n\\[ c = 5 \\]\n\nNow that we know the length of the hypotenuse is 5 inches, we can find the perimeter of the triangle. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. The sides of the triangle are 4 inches, 3 inches, and 5 inches. Therefore, the perimeter is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 4 + 3 + 5 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 12 \\]\n\nSo, the length of the perimeter of the triangle is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
        "To find the length of the perimeter of the right-angle triangle that Elliott drew, we first need to determine the length of the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angle triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b).

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 5 inches.\n\nNext, we calculate the perimeter of the triangle. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all three sides of the triangle. Therefore, we add the base, the height, and the hypotenuse:\n\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 4 + 3 + 5 = 12 \\]\n\nThus, the length of the perimeter of the triangle is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
