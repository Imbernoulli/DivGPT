        "To find the cost of the discounted subscription, we need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Determine the discount amount.\n   The discount is 45% of the original price. So, we calculate 45% of $80.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount amount} = 0.45 \\times 80 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2.

To find out how much the discount is in dollars, we multiply the original cost by the discount rate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Discount} = 80 \\times \\frac{45}{100} = 80 \\times 0.45 = 36 \\]\n\nSo, the discount is $36. To find the discounted price, we subtract the discount from the original cost:\n\n\\[ \\text{Discounted Price} = 80 - 36 = 44 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the discounted subscription is \\(\\boxed{44}\\).",
