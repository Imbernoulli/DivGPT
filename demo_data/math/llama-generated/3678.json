        "To determine the cost of each piece of pizza, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pizza pieces.\n2. Divide the total cost of the pizzas by the total number of pieces.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pizza pieces. Since each pizza is cut into 5 pieces and Luigi bought 4 pizzas, we can find the total number of pieces by multiplying the number of pizzas by the number of pieces per pizza:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ pizzas} \\times 5 \\text{ pieces per pizza} = 20 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nNext, we need to divide the total cost of the pizzas by the total number of pieces to find the cost per piece. The total cost of the pizzas is $80, so we divide $80 by 20 pieces:\n\\[ 80 \\text{ dollars} \\div 20 \\text{ pieces} = 4 \\text{ dollars per piece} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of each piece of pizza is \\(\\boxed{4}\\) dollars.",

        "To determine the cost of each piece of pizza, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pizza pieces.\n2. Divide the total cost of the pizzas by the total number of pieces.\n\nFirst, we find the total number of pizza pieces. Since each pizza is cut into 5 pieces and Luigi bought 4 pizzas, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of pieces per pizza:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ pizzas} \\times 5 \\text{ pieces per pizza} = 20 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nNext, we divide the total cost of the pizzas by the total number of pieces to find the cost per piece. The total cost of the pizzas is $80, so we divide $80 by 20 pieces:\n\\[ 80 \\text{ dollars} \\div 20 \\text{ pieces} = 4 \\text{ dollars per piece} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of each piece of pizza is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."
