        "Let's start by calculating the total amount of money Yanni had before he spent any money. Initially, Yanni had $0.85. His mother gave him an additional $0.40, and he found $0.50. So, we add these amounts together:\n\n\\[0.85 + 0.40 + 0.50 = 1.75\\]\n\nYanni then bought a toy that cost $1.60. To find out how much money Yanni has left, we subtract the cost of the toy from the total amount of money he had:\n\n\\[1.75 - 1.60 = 0.15\\]\n\nSince we need the answer in cents, we convert $0.15 to cents. Since $1.00 is equal to 100 cents, $0.15 is equal to 15 cents. Therefore, the amount of money Yanni has left is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{15}\\]",
