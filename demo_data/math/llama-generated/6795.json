        "To find the difference in area between the rectangle and the square, we first need to calculate the area of each shape individually.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of rectangle} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n\\]\nFor the given rectangle, the length is 3 inches and the width is 6 inches.

        "To determine the difference in area between the rectangle and the square, we need to calculate the area of each shape separately and then find the difference between the two areas.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the rectangle. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{rectangle}} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n\\]\nGiven the length is 3 inches and the width is 6 inches, we substitute these values into the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{rectangle}} = 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the area of the square.
