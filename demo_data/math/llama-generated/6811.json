Determine how many of the fertile eggs will hatch.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of fertile eggs.**\n\nThe gecko lays 30 eggs per year, and 20 percent of them are infertile. Therefore, 80 percent of the eggs are fertile. We can find the number of fertile eggs by calculating 80 percent of 30:\n\\[\n0.80 \\times 30 = 24\n\\]\nSo, there are 24 fertile eggs.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many of the fertile eggs will hatch.**\n\nA third of the remaining fertile eggs will not hatch due to calcification issues. Therefore, two-thirds of the fertile eggs will hatch. We can find the number of eggs that hatch by calculating two-thirds of 24:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 24 = 16\n\\]\nSo, 16 eggs actually hatch.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]",
