        "To determine the thickness of Janet's blanket after 4 foldings, we need to follow the process step by step. Each time the blanket is folded, its thickness doubles. Let's start with the initial thickness and apply the doubling effect for each folding.\n\n1. **Initial thickness**: The blanket starts at 3 inches thick.\n2. **After the first folding**: The thickness doubles, so \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) inches.\n3. **After the second folding**: The thickness doubles again, so \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\) inches.\n4. **After the third folding**: The thickness doubles again, so \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\) inches.\n5. **After the fourth folding**: The thickness doubles again, so \\(24 \\times 2 = 48\\) inches.\n\nTherefore, the thickness of the blanket after 4 foldings is \\(\\boxed{48}\\) inches.",
