Jenny is older than Charlie by five years, so \\( J = C + 5 \\).\n2. Charlie is older than Bobby by three years, so \\( C = B + 3 \\).\n\nWe need to find out how old Charlie will be when Jenny becomes twice as old as Bobby. Let's say this happens in \\( x \\) years.

At that time, Charlie's age will be:\n\\[ C + x = C + (8 - B) \\]\n\nSince \\( C = B + 3 \\), substitute \\( C = B + 3 \\) into the equation:\n\\[ C + (8 - B) = (B + 3) + (8 - B) \\]\n\\[ C + (8 - B) = B + 3 + 8 - B \\]\n\\[ C + (8 - B) = 11 \\]\n\nTherefore, Charlie will be \\(\\boxed{11}\\) years old when Jenny becomes twice as old as Bobby.",
        "Let's define the current ages of Jenny, Charlie, and Bobby using variables. Let \\( B \\) be Bobby's current age.

At that time, Charlie's age will be:\n\\[ C + x = C + (8 - B). \\]\n\nSince \\( C = B + 3 \\), substitute \\( C \\) with \\( B + 3 \\):\n\\[ C + (8 - B) = (B + 3) + (8 - B) = 3 + 8 = 11. \\]\n\nTherefore, Charlie will be \\(\\boxed{11}\\) years old when Jenny becomes twice as old as Bobby.",

Since \\( J = C + 5 \\) and \\( C = B + 3 \\), we can substitute \\( J = (B + 3) + 5 = B + 8 \\).
