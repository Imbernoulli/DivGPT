        "To determine how many more tanks Jennifer needs to build, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of fish currently in the tanks she has built.\n2. Determine how many more fish she needs to house.\n3. Calculate the number of additional tanks required to house the remaining fish.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of fish currently in the tanks she has built. Jennifer built 3 tanks, and each tank holds 15 fish:\n\\[\n3 \\times 15 = 45\n\\]\nSo, she currently has 45 fish in her tanks.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many more fish she needs to house. She wants to have a total of 75 fish, so we subtract the number of fish she currently has from 75:\n\\[\n75 - 45 = 30\n\\]\nSo, she needs to house 30 more fish.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of additional tanks required to house the remaining 30 fish. Each of the new tanks will hold 10 fish:\n\\[\n30 \\div 10 = 3\n\\]\nSo, she needs to build 3 more tanks.\n\nTherefore, the number of additional tanks Jennifer needs to build is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
