        "To determine how much James paid for the beef, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of the beef.\n2. Multiply the total weight by the price per pound.\n\nFirst, let's find the total weight of the beef. James buys 5 packs, and each pack weighs 4 pounds. So, we multiply the number of packs by the weight of each pack:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ packs} \\times 4 \\text{ pounds per pack} = 20 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much 20 pounds of beef costs. The price of beef is $5.50 per pound. So, we multiply the total weight by the price per pound:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ pounds} \\times 5.50 \\text{ dollars per pound} = 110 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount James paid is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",
