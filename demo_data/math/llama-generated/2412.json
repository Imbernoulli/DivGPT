Find the difference between the total cost of the fabric Nicholas bought and the total cost of the fabric Kenneth bought.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Kenneth bought 700 oz of fabric.\n\n2. Nicholas bought six times as much fabric as Kenneth. Therefore, the amount of fabric Nicholas bought is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 700 = 4200 \\text{ oz}\n   \\]\n\n3. The cost of fabric is $40 per oz. So, the total cost of the fabric Kenneth bought is:\n   \\[\n   700 \\times 40 = 28000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. The total cost of the fabric Nicholas bought is:\n   \\[\n   4200 \\times 40 = 168000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. The difference between the total cost of the fabric Nicholas bought and the total cost of the fabric Kenneth bought is:\n   \\[\n   168000 - 28000 = 140000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Nicholas paid \\(\\boxed{140000}\\) dollars more than Kenneth for the fabric he bought.",
