        "To find out what percentage of the snowballs Janet made, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of snowballs made by Janet and her brother.\n2. Calculate the fraction of the total snowballs that Janet made.\n3. Convert the fraction to a percentage.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of snowballs made by Janet and her brother:\n\\[\n50 + 150 = 200\n\\]\nSo, the total number of snowballs is 200.\n\nNext, we calculate the fraction of the total snowballs that Janet made:\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{200}\n\\]\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:\n\\[\n\\frac{50 \\div 50}{200 \\div 50} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\nSo, Janet made \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the total snowballs.\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) to a percentage, we multiply it by 100:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25\n\\]\nSo, Janet made 25% of the snowballs.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the snowballs that Janet made is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",

The total number of snowballs made is the sum of the snowballs made by Janet and her brother:\n\\[\n50 + 150 = 200\n\\]\nSo, the total number of snowballs is 200.\n\nNext, we move to step 2. The fraction of the total snowballs that Janet made is:\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{200}\n\\]\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:\n\\[\n\\frac{50 \\div 50}{200 \\div 50} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\nSo, Janet made \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the total snowballs.\n\nFinally, we convert the fraction \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) into a percentage. To do this, we multiply the fraction by 100:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 100 = 25\n\\]\nSo, Janet made 25% of the snowballs.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{25}\n\\]",
