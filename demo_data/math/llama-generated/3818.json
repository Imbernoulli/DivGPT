Subtract the number of bottles she drinks from the total number of bottles she initially bought.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of soda bottles Rebecca initially bought. She bought three 6-packs of sodas, so we multiply the number of packs by the number of bottles per pack:\n\\[\n3 \\times 6 = 18\n\\]\nSo, Rebecca initially has 18 bottles of soda.\n\nNext, let's determine how many bottles of soda Rebecca drinks in four weeks. Since she drinks half a bottle of soda each day, we first find out how many bottles she drinks in one week by multiplying the number of bottles she drinks per day by the number of days in a week:\n\\[\n0.5 \\times 7 = 3.5\n\\]\nSo, Rebecca drinks 3.5 bottles of soda each week.

Subtract the number of bottles of soda Rebecca drinks in four weeks from the total number of bottles she bought.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Rebecca bought three 6-packs of sodas. Therefore, the total number of bottles of soda she bought is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Rebecca drinks half a bottle of soda each day. So, in one day she drinks:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ bottle} \\]\n\nTo find out how many bottles of soda Rebecca drinks in four weeks, we need to calculate the number of days in four weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, four weeks have:\n\\[ 4 \\times 7 = 28 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of bottles of soda Rebecca drinks in four weeks is:\n\\[ 28 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 14 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of bottles of soda Rebecca drinks in four weeks from the total number of bottles she bought:\n\\[ 18 - 14 = 4 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nSo, the number of bottles of soda Rebecca will have left after four weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]",
