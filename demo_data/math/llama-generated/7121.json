        "To determine how many seconds it will take Belinda's border collie to catch up to the ball, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the distance the ball travels before hitting the ground.\n2. Determine the time it takes for the border collie to cover that distance.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the distance the ball travels.**\n\nThe ball is thrown at a speed of 20 feet/second and flies for 8 seconds. The distance \\( d \\) traveled by the ball is given by the formula:\n\\[ d = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ d = 20 \\, \\text{feet/second} \\times 8 \\, \\text{seconds} = 160 \\, \\text{feet} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the time it takes for the border collie to cover the distance.**\n\nThe border collie runs at a speed of 5 feet/second. The time \\( t \\) it takes for the border collie to cover 160 feet is given by the formula:\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\]\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ t = \\frac{160 \\, \\text{feet}}{5 \\, \\text{feet/second}} = 32 \\, \\text{seconds} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take the border collie \\(\\boxed{32}\\) seconds to catch up to the ball.",
        "To determine how many seconds it will take Belinda's border collie to catch up to the ball, we need to calculate the total distance the ball travels before hitting the ground and then find out how long it takes for the border collie to cover that distance.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance the ball travels. The ball's speed is 20 feet/second and it flies for 8 seconds. Therefore, the total distance the ball travels is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ feet/second} \\times 8 \\text{ seconds} = 160 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes for the border collie to run 160 feet.

Determine how long it takes for the border collie to run that distance.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total distance the ball travels.**\n\nThe ball is thrown at a speed of 20 feet/second and flies for 8 seconds. Therefore, the total distance the ball travels is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ feet/second} \\times 8 \\text{ seconds} = 160 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how long it takes for the border collie to run that distance.**\n\nThe border collie runs at a speed of 5 feet/second. To find out how many seconds it takes for the border collie to run 160 feet, we divide the distance by the border collie's speed:\n\\[\n160 \\text{ feet} \\div 5 \\text{ feet/second} = 32 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take the border collie \\(\\boxed{32}\\) seconds to catch up to the ball.",
