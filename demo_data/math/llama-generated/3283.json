        "To determine the 20% tip, we first need to find the total bill before the tip. We know that Melisa added a 15% tip of $42. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the total bill:\n\n\\[ 0.15 \\times \\text{total bill} = 42 \\]\n\nTo solve for the total bill, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.15:\n\n\\[ \\text{total bill} = \\frac{42}{0.15} \\]\n\nTo simplify the division, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n\\[ \\text{total bill} = \\frac{42 \\times 100}{0.15 \\times 100} = \\frac{4200}{15} \\]\n\nNow, we perform the division:\n\n\\[ \\text{total bill} = 280 \\]\n\nNow that we know the total bill is $280, we can calculate the 20% tip by multiplying the total bill by 0.20:\n\n\\[ \\text{20% tip} = 0.20 \\times 280 = 56 \\]\n\nTherefore, the 20% tip is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",

Now, we need to calculate a 20% tip on this bill. A 20% tip can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 280 = 56 \\]\n\nTherefore, a 20% tip is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",
        "To determine the 20% tip, we first need to find the original bill amount. We know that Melisa added a 15% tip of $42. Let's denote the original bill amount by \\( B \\).\n\nThe relationship between the tip and the bill can be expressed as:\n\\[ 0.15B = 42 \\]\n\nTo find \\( B \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.15:\n\\[ B = \\frac{42}{0.15} \\]\n\nPerforming the division:\n\\[ B = 280 \\]\n\nSo, the original bill amount is $280. Now, we need to calculate the 20% tip. A 20% tip is given by:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times B = 0.20 \\times 280 = 56 \\]\n\nTherefore, a 20% tip is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",
        "To determine the 20% tip, we first need to find the total bill before the tip. We know that Melisa added a 15% tip of $42. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the total bill:\n\n\\[ 0.15 \\times \\text{total bill} = 42 \\]\n\nTo solve for the total bill, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.15:\n\n\\[ \\text{total bill} = \\frac{42}{0.15} \\]\n\nPerforming the division, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{total bill} = 280 \\]\n\nNow that we know the total bill is $280, we can calculate a 20% tip. To find the 20% tip, we multiply the total bill by 0.20:\n\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 280 = 56 \\]\n\nTherefore, a 20% tip is \\(\\boxed{56}\\)."
