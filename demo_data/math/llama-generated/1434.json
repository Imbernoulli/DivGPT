The discount amount per gallon is:\n\\[ 30.00 \\times 0.20 = 6.00 \\]\nSo, the cost per gallon of primer after the discount is:\n\\[ 30.00 - 6.00 = 24.00 \\]\nTherefore, the total cost for 5 gallons of primer is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 24.00 = 120.00 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the paint. Blake needs 5 gallons of paint, and each gallon costs $25.00. So, the total cost for 5 gallons of paint is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 25.00 = 125.00 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total cost of the primer and the total cost of the paint to find the overall cost:\n\\[ 120.00 + 125.00 = 245.00 \\]\n\nThus, Blake will spend \\(\\boxed{245}\\) dollars on paint and primer.",
