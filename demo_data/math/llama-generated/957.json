        "To determine how old John's sister will be when John is 50 years old, we start by finding out her current age. John is currently 10 years old, and his sister is twice his age. Therefore, we calculate her current age as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sister's current age} = 2 \\times \\text{John's current age} = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many years will pass until John is 50 years old. Since John is currently 10 years old, we subtract his current age from 50:\n\n\\[ \\text{Years until John is 50} = 50 - 10 = 40 \\]\n\nIn 40 years, John's sister will also be 40 years older than she is now. Therefore, we add 40 years to her current age to find out how old she will be when John is 50:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sister's age when John is 50} = \\text{Sister's current age} + 40 = 20 + 40 = 60 \\]\n\nThus, when John is 50 years old, his sister will be \\boxed{60} years old.",
