        "To determine how much money Mr. Parker saves by buying the meals versus buying the individual food items, we need to calculate the total cost of the meals and the total cost of the individual food items, and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the meals Mr. Parker buys:\n- Mr. Parker buys 2 burger meals, and each burger meal costs $9.50.\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 9.50 = 19.00\n  \\]\n- Mr. Parker also buys 2 burger meals and 2 kid's meals, and each burger meal costs $9.50 and each kid's meal costs $5.\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 9.50 + 2 \\times 5 = 19.00 + 10.00 = 29.00\n  \\]\n- Adding these together, the total cost of all the meals is:\n  \\[\n  19.00 + 29.00 = 48.00\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the individual food items Mr. Parker buys:\n- Mr. Parker buys 2 burger meals, and each burger meal consists of a burger, french fries, and a soft drink. So, the cost of the food items for the burger meals is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times (5 + 3 + 3) = 2 \\times 11 = 22.00\n  \\]\n- Mr. Parker also buys 2 burger meals and 2 kid's meals. The cost of the food items for the burger meals is the same as above, which is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 11 = 22.00\n  \\]\n- The cost of the food items for the kid's meals is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times (3 + 2 + 2) = 2 \\times 7 = 14.00\n  \\]\n- Adding these together, the total cost of all the individual food items is:\n  \\[\n  22.00 + 22.00 + 14.00 = 58.00\n  \\]\n\nFinally, let's find out how much money Mr. Parker saves by buying the meals instead of the individual food items:\n\\[\n58.00 - 48.00 = 10.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mr. Parker saves \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars.",

Therefore, the cost for 2 burger meals is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 11 = 22.00\n  \\]\n- For the 2 burger meals and 2 kid's meals, the cost of each burger meal is $11 and the cost of each kid's meal is $3 + $2 + $2 = $7. Therefore, the cost for 2 burger meals and 2 kid's meals is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 11 + 2 \\times 7 = 22.00 + 14.00 = 36.00\n  \\]\n- Adding these together gives the total cost of all the individual food items:\n  \\[\n  22.00 + 36.00 = 58.00\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the total cost of the individual food items and the total cost of the meals to determine how much money Mr. Parker saves:\n\\[\n58.00 - 48.00 = 10.00\n\\]\n\nThus, Mr. Parker saves \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars by buying the 6 meals versus buying the individual food items.",

        "To determine how much money Mr. Parker saves by buying the 6 meals versus buying the individual food items, we need to calculate the total cost of the meals and the total cost of the individual food items, and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the meals:\n- Mr. Parker buys 2 burger meals for his wife and himself.\n- Each burger meal costs $9.50.\n- Therefore, the cost for the 2 burger meals is \\(2 \\times 9.50 = 19\\) dollars.\n\n- Mr. Parker buys 2 burger meals and 2 kid's meals for his 4 children.\n- Each burger meal costs $9.50, and each kid's meal costs $5.\n- Therefore, the cost for the 2 burger meals is \\(2 \\times 9.50 = 19\\) dollars.\n- The cost for the 2 kid's meals is \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) dollars.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the 2 burger meals and 2 kid's meals is \\(19 + 10 = 29\\) dollars.\n\n- Adding the costs for Mr. Parker's meals and his children's meals, the total cost of the meals is \\(19 + 29 = 48\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the individual food items:\n- For Mr. Parker's 2 burger meals:\n  - Each burger meal includes a burger, french fries, and a soft drink.\n  - The cost of one burger meal is \\(5 + 3 + 3 = 11\\) dollars.\n  - Therefore, the cost for the 2 burger meals is \\(2 \\times 11 = 22\\) dollars.\n\n- For Mr. Parker's 2 burger meals and 2 kid's meals:\n  - Each burger meal includes a burger, french fries, and a soft drink.\n  - The cost of one burger meal is \\(5 + 3 + 3 = 11\\) dollars.\n  - Therefore, the cost for the 2 burger meals is \\(2 \\times 11 = 22\\) dollars.\n  - Each kid's meal includes a kid's burger, kid's french fries, and a kid's juice box.\n  - The cost of one kid's meal is \\(3 + 2 + 2 = 7\\) dollars.\n  - Therefore, the cost for the 2 kid's meals is \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\) dollars.\n  - Therefore, the total cost for the 2 burger meals and 2 kid's meals is \\(22 + 14 = 36\\) dollars.\n\n- Adding the costs for Mr. Parker's meals and his children's meals, the total cost of the individual food items is \\(22 + 36 = 58\\) dollars.\n\nFinally, let's find the amount of money Mr. Parker saves by buying the 6 meals versus buying the individual food items:\n- The savings is the difference between the total cost of the individual food items and the total cost of the meals.\n- Therefore, the savings is \\(58 - 48 = 10\\) dollars.\n\nThe amount of money Mr. Parker saves is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

        "To determine how much money Mr. Parker saves by buying the meals versus buying the individual food items, we need to calculate the total cost for each option and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the meals Mr. Parker buys:\n\n1. Mr. Parker buys 2 burger meals for himself and his wife. The cost of one burger meal is $9.50.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 9.50 = 19.00\n   \\]\n   So, the cost for the 2 burger meals is $19.00.\n\n2. Mr. Parker also buys 2 burger meals and 2 kid's meals for his 4 children. The cost of one burger meal is $9.50 and the cost of one kid's meal is $5.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 9.50 = 19.00\n   \\]\n   So, the cost for the 2 burger meals is $19.00.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 5 = 10.00\n   \\]\n   So, the cost for the 2 kid's meals is $10.00.\n   \\[\n   19.00 + 10.00 = 29.00\n   \\]\n   So, the cost for the 2 burger meals and 2 kid's meals is $29.00.\n\nAdding the costs for the meals for Mr. Parker and his children, we get:\n\\[\n19.00 + 29.00 = 48.00\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the meals is $48.00.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost if Mr. Parker were to buy the individual food items:\n\n1. For the 2 burger meals, the cost would be:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times (5 + 3 + 3) = 2 \\times 11 = 22.00\n   \\]\n   So, the cost for the 2 burger meals is $22.00.\n\n2. For the 2 burger meals, the cost would be:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times (5 + 3 + 3) = 2 \\times 11 = 22.00\n   \\]\n   So, the cost for the 2 burger meals is $22.00.\n   \\]\n\n3. For the 2 kid's meals, the cost would be:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times (3 + 2 + 2) = 2 \\times 7 = 14.00\n   \\]\n   So, the cost for the 2 kid's meals is $14.00.\n\nAdding the costs for the individual food items for Mr. Parker and his children, we get:\n\\[\n22.00 + 22.00 + 14.00 = 58.00\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the individual food items is $58.00.\n\nFinally, the amount of money Mr. Parker saves by buying the meals instead of the individual food items is:\n\\[\n58.00 - 48.00 = 10.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mr. Parker saves \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine how much money Mr. Parker saves by buying the 6 meals versus buying the individual food items, we need to calculate the total cost of the meals and the total cost of the individual food items separately, and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the meals Mr. Parker buys:\n- Mr. Parker buys 2 burger meals for his wife and himself. Since each burger meal costs $9.50, the cost for these meals is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 9.50 = 19.00\n  \\]\n- Mr. Parker also buys 2 burger meals and 2 kid's meals for his 4 children. Since each burger meal costs $9.50 and each kid's meal costs $5, the cost for these meals is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 9.50 + 2 \\times 5 = 19.00 + 10.00 = 29.00\n  \\]\n- Adding these amounts together, the total cost of all the meals is:\n  \\[\n  19.00 + 29.00 = 48.00\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the individual food items Mr. Parker would have bought:\n- For the 2 burger meals, the individual cost would be:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times (5 + 3 + 3) = 2 \\times 11 = 22.00\n  \\]\n- For the 2 burger meals and 2 kid's meals, the individual cost would be:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times (5 + 3 + 3) + 2 \\times (3 + 2 + 2) = 2 \\times 11 + 2 \\times 7 = 22.00 + 14.00 = 36.00\n  \\]\n- Adding these amounts together, the total cost of the individual food items is:\n  \\[\n  22.00 + 36.00 = 58.00\n  \\]\n\nFinally, the amount of money Mr. Parker saves by buying the 6 meals versus buying the individual food items is:\n\\[\n58.00 - 48.00 = 10.00\n\\]\n\nThus, Mr. Parker saves \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars.",
