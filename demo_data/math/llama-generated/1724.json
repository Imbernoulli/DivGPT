        "Let's denote the price of the coat by \\( C \\) and the price of the shirt by \\( S \\). According to the problem, the total cost of the shirt and the coat is $600, and the shirt costs one-third the price of the coat. This gives us two equations:\n\n1. \\( S + C = 600 \\)\n2. \\( S = \\frac{1}{3}C \\)\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \\( S \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3}C + C = 600 \\]\n\nTo combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1 and 3 is 3, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3}C + \\frac{3}{3}C = 600 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{3}C = 600 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( C \\), we need to isolate \\( C \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\), which is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\):\n\n\\[ C = 600 \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ C = 450 \\]\n\nSo, the price of the coat is $450. Now, we can find the price of the shirt using the second equation:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{1}{3}C = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 450 = 150 \\]\n\nTherefore, the price of the shirt is \\(\\boxed{150}\\).",

We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{3} + C = 600\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term in the equation by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\cdot \\frac{C}{3} + 3 \\cdot C = 3 \\cdot 600\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nC + 3C = 1800\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[\n4C = 1800\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( C \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{1800}{4} = 450\n\\]\n\nSo, the price of the coat is $450.
