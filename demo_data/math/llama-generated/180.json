        "To determine the cost of buying 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4-member family after the price increase, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the new price per pound after the increase:**\n   The original price per pound is $1.6. The price increase is 25%.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increase amount} = 1.6 \\times 0.25 = 0.4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{New price per pound} = 1.6 + 0.4 = 2.0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of 2 pounds of apples for one person:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost for 2 pounds per person} = 2.0 \\times 2 = 4.0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for a 4-member family:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost for 4 people} = 4.0 \\times 4 = 16.0\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4-member family is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
        "To determine the new cost of apples after a 25% price increase, we start by calculating the increase in price per pound. The original price of apples is $1.6 per pound.

Calculate the total cost for a 4-member family.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the new price per pound of apples.**\n\nThe original price per pound is $1.6. A 25% increase means we need to find 25% of $1.6 and add it to the original price.\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase} = 1.6 \\times \\frac{25}{100} = 1.6 \\times 0.25 = 0.4 \\]\n\nSo, the new price per pound is:\n\n\\[ 1.6 + 0.4 = 2.0 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost of 2 pounds of apples.**\n\nNow that the price per pound is $2.0, the cost for 2 pounds is:\n\n\\[ 2.0 \\times 2 = 4.0 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for a 4-member family.**\n\nSince each person in the family buys 2 pounds of apples, the total cost for the family is:\n\n\\[ 4.0 \\times 4 = 16.0 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4-member family is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]",
        "To determine the cost of buying 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4-member family after the price increase, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the new price per pound after the increase:**\n   - The original price per pound is $1.6.\n   - The price increase is 25%.\n   - To find the increase amount, we multiply the original price by 25% (or 0.25):\n     \\[\n     1.6 \\times 0.25 = 0.4\n     \\]\n   - Add the increase to the original price to get the new price per pound:\n     \\[\n     1.6 + 0.4 = 2.0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost for 2 pounds of apples per person:**\n   - Each person buys 2 pounds of apples.\n   - The cost per pound is $2.0.\n   - Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds per person is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 2.0 = 4.0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for a 4-member family:**\n   - There are 4 people in the family.\n   - Each person spends $4.0 on 2 pounds of apples.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the family is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 4.0 = 16.0\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total cost to buy 2 pounds of apples for each person in a 4-member family is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
