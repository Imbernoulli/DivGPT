        "To determine the total number of wins the basketball team had over the three competitions, we need to calculate the number of wins in each competition and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First Competition:**\n   The team won 40 games.\n\n2. **Second Competition:**\n   The team won \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) times as many games as they won in their first competition.

Therefore, the number of games won in the second competition, \\( W_2 \\), is:\n\\[\nW_2 = \\frac{5}{8} \\times 40 = \\frac{5 \\times 40}{8} = \\frac{200}{8} = 25\n\\]\n\nIn the third competition, the team won the same number of games as the sum of the first and second competition winnings. Therefore, the number of games won in the third competition, \\( W_3 \\), is:\n\\[\nW_3 = W_1 + W_2 = 40 + 25 = 65\n\\]\n\nTo find the total number of wins in the three competitions, we add the number of games won in each competition:\n\\[\nW_1 + W_2 + W_3 = 40 + 25 + 65 = 130\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of wins they had in the three competitions is \\(\\boxed{130}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of wins the basketball team had in the three competitions, we need to calculate the number of wins in each competition and then sum them up.\n\n1. **First Competition:**\n   The team won 40 games.\n\n2. **Second Competition:**\n   The team won \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) times as many games as they won in the first competition.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Wins in the second competition} = 40 \\times \\frac{5}{8}\n   \\]\n   First, calculate \\(\\frac{5}{8} \\times 40\\):\n   \\[\n   40 \\times \\frac{5}{8} = 40 \\times 0.625 = 25\n   \\]\n   So, the team won 25 games in the second competition.\n\n3. **Third Competition:**\n   The team won the same number of games as the sum of the first and second competition winnings.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Wins in the third competition} = 40 + 25\n   \\]\n   Calculate the sum:\n   \\[\n   40 + 25 = 65\n   \\]\n   So, the team won 65 games in the third competition.\n\n4. **Total Wins:**\n   To find the total number of wins over the three competitions, sum the wins from each competition:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total wins} = 40 + 25 + 65\n   \\]\n   Calculate the sum:\n   \\[\n   40 + 25 + 65 = 130\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of wins the team had in the three competitions is \\(\\boxed{130}\\)."
