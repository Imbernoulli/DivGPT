        "To determine the total time Mike spends watching TV and playing video games in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Mike spends watching TV in a week. Since Mike watches TV for 4 hours every day, we can find the total time for the week by multiplying the daily time by the number of days in a week:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 28 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Mike spends playing video games in a week. Mike plays video games for half as long as he watches TV on the days he plays. Since he plays video games 3 days a week, we first find out how much time he spends playing video games each day:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4 \\text{ hours}}{2} = 2 \\text{ hours/day}\n\\]\n\nThen, we find the total time he spends playing video games in a week by multiplying the daily time by the number of days he plays:\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days/week} = 6 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the time spent watching TV and the time spent playing video games to get the total time spent on both activities in a week:\n\n\\[\n28 \\text{ hours/week} + 6 \\text{ hours/week} = 34 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time Mike spends watching TV and playing video games in a week is \\boxed{34}.",
