Therefore, we can calculate Mary's age as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Mary's age} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 = 15\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the ages of John, Mary, and Tonya, we can find their average age by adding their ages together and then dividing by 3:\n\\[\n\\text{Average age} = \\frac{\\text{John's age} + \\text{Mary's age} + \\text{Tonya's age}}{3} = \\frac{30 + 15 + 60}{3} = \\frac{105}{3} = 35\n\\]\n\nThus, the average age of John, Mary, and Tonya is \\boxed{35}.",
        "To determine the average age of John, Mary, and Tonya, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the age of Tonya.\n2. Use the information given to find John's age.\n3.
