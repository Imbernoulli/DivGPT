        "To determine how much weight Lindsey will squat, we need to consider the resistance added by each exercise band and the weight of the dumbbell she picks up.\n\n1. Each exercise band adds 5 pounds of resistance. Since Lindsey bought 2 exercise bands and she doubles up both sets of bands, she will have 4 exercise bands in total.\n2. The total resistance added by the exercise bands is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ bands} \\times 5 \\text{ pounds per band} = 20 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n3.
