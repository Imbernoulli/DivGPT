        "To determine the total cost Tom has to pay in a year for leasing the car, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. We'll start by calculating the weekly cost and then convert it to an annual cost.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the weekly mileage\nTom drives different distances on different days of the week:\n- On Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday, he drives 50 miles each day.\n- On Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, he drives 100 miles each day.\n\nFirst, calculate the total miles driven on the days he drives 50 miles:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ days} \\times 50 \\text{ miles/day} = 200 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the total miles driven on the days he drives 100 miles:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ days} \\times 100 \\text{ miles/day} = 300 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNow, add the miles driven on both sets of days to get the total weekly mileage:\n\\[\n200 \\text{ miles} + 300 \\text{ miles} = 500 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the weekly cost of the miles driven\nTom pays $0.1 per mile. Therefore, the cost for the miles driven in a week is:\n\\[\n500 \\text{ miles} \\times \\$0.1/\\text{mile} = \\$50\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total weekly cost\nIn addition to the cost of the miles driven, Tom also pays a weekly fee of $100. Therefore, the total weekly cost is:\n\\[\n\\$50 + \\$100 = \\$150\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the annual cost\nThere are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total annual cost is:\n\\[\n52 \\text{ weeks} \\times \\$150/\\text{week} = \\$7800\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount Tom has to pay in a year is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7800}\n\\]",
