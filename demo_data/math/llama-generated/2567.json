Therefore, to go up 20 stories, the time taken by Tara is the sum of the time spent running up the stories and the time spent stopping at each floor. The time spent running up 20 stories is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ stories} \\times 8 \\text{ seconds/story} = 160 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\nThe time spent stopping at each floor is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ stops} \\times 3 \\text{ seconds/stop} = 60 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\nAdding these two times together gives the total time taken by Tara:\n\\[\n160 \\text{ seconds} + 60 \\text{ seconds} = 220 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n**Comparing the times:**\nLola takes 200 seconds, and Tara takes 220 seconds.
