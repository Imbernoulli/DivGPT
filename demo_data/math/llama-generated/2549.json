Louise adds 20 teddy bears to her cart, so the total cost of the teddy bears is:\n\\[ 20x \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total cost of all the toys in the cart after adding the teddy bears is the sum of the cost of the original toys and the cost of the teddy bears:\n\\[ 280 + 20x \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nWe know that Louise has $580 in her wallet, which is exactly enough to pay for all the toys. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 280 + 20x = 580 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 280 from both sides:\n\\[ 20x = 300 \\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by 20:\n\\[ x = 15 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of each teddy bear is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
