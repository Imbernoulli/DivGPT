        "To determine how much Jan paid for the roses, we can break down the problem into a series of steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of roses Jan bought.\n2. Determine the total cost of the roses before the discount.\n3. Apply the discount to find the final amount Jan paid.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Jan bought.**\n\nJan bought 5 dozen roses. Since one dozen equals 12 roses, we can calculate the total number of roses as follows:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ dozen} = 5 \\times 12 = 60 \\text{ roses} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total cost of the roses before the discount.**\n\nEach rose costs $6. Therefore, the total cost of 60 roses is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ roses} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars/rose} = 360 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Apply the discount to find the final amount Jan paid.**\n\nJan only needs to pay 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $360, we can multiply $360 by 0.80:\n\\[ 360 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.80 = 288 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the amount Jan paid is:\n\\[ \\boxed{288} \\]",

Since one dozen equals 12 roses, we can calculate the total number of roses as follows:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 12 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, Jan bought 60 roses.\n\n2. Each rose costs $6. Therefore, the total cost of the roses before the discount is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\times 6 = 360\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost before the discount is $360.\n\n3. Jan only needs to pay 80% of the total cost. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of the total cost:\n   \\[\n   360 \\times 0.20 = 72\n   \\]\n   So, the discount amount is $72. Therefore, the amount Jan paid is:\n   \\[\n   360 - 72 = 288\n   \\]\n\nSo, the amount Jan paid is \\(\\boxed{288}\\).",

Determine the total cost of the roses before the discount.\n3. Calculate the discount amount.\n4. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find out how much Jan paid.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Jan bought.**\n\nJan buys 5 dozen roses. Since one dozen equals 12 roses, we multiply:\n\\[ 5 \\times 12 = 60 \\]\nSo, Jan bought 60 roses.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total cost of the roses before the discount.**\n\nEach rose costs $6, so we multiply the number of roses by the cost per rose:\n\\[ 60 \\times 6 = 360 \\]\nSo, the total cost before the discount is $360.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the discount amount.**\n\nJan only needs to pay 80% of the total cost. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of the total cost (since 100% - 80% = 20%):\n\\[ 360 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 360 \\times 0.20 = 72 \\]\nSo, the discount amount is $72.\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find out how much Jan paid.**\n\nWe subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount:\n\\[ 360 - 72 = 288 \\]\nSo, Jan paid \\(\\boxed{288}\\).",
