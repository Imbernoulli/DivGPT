The salesman sold 17 backpacks for $18 each, so the revenue from these sales is:\n\\[ 17 \\times 18 = 306 \\]\n\nHe also sold 10 backpacks to a department store for $25 each, so the revenue from these sales is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 25 = 250 \\]\n\nThe total number of backpacks sold so far is:\n\\[ 17 + 10 = 27 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of backpacks remaining to be sold is:\n\\[ 48 - 27 = 21 \\]\n\nThe remaining backpacks were sold for $22 each, so the revenue from these sales is:\n\\[ 21 \\times 22 = 462 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue from all the sales:\n\\[ 306 + 250 + 462 = 1018 \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:\n\\[ 1018 - 576 = 442 \\]\n\nSo, the salesman's profit is:\n\\[ \\boxed{442} \\]",

Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the backpacks.**\n\nThe salesman bought a case of 48 backpacks for $576. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = \\$576 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the backpacks.**\n\nThe salesman sold 17 backpacks for $18 each, so the revenue from these sales is:\n\\[ 17 \\times 18 = \\$306 \\]\n\nHe sold 10 backpacks for $25 each, so the revenue from these sales is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 25 = \\$250 \\]\n\nThe remainder of the backpacks was sold for $22 each. First, we need to find out how many backpacks remained after selling 17 and 10:\n\\[ 48 - 17 - 10 = 21 \\]\nSo, the revenue from selling the remaining 21 backpacks is:\n\\[ 21 \\times 22 = \\$462 \\]\n\nNow, we add up the revenue from all the sales to find the total revenue:\n\\[ 306 + 250 + 462 = \\$1018 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.**\n\nThe profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:\n\\[ 1018 - 576 = \\$442 \\]\n\nTherefore, the salesman's profit is:\n\\[ \\boxed{442} \\]",
