So, we multiply the number of widgets per hour by the number of hours he works in a day:\n\n\\[ 20 \\text{ widgets/hour} \\times 8 \\text{ hours/day} = 160 \\text{ widgets/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many widgets John makes in a week. He works 5 days a week, so we multiply the number of widgets he makes in one day by the number of days he works in a week:\n\n\\[ 160 \\text{ widgets/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 800 \\text{ widgets/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of widgets John makes in a week is \\(\\boxed{800}\\).",

Since he makes 20 widgets per hour and works for 8 hours each day, we multiply the number of widgets per hour by the number of hours he works per day:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ widgets/hour} \\times 8 \\text{ hours/day} = 160 \\text{ widgets/day} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of widgets John makes in a week. Since he works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of widgets he makes in one day by the number of days he works in a week:\n\\[ 160 \\text{ widgets/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 800 \\text{ widgets/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of widgets John makes in a week is \\(\\boxed{800}\\).",
        "To determine how many widgets John makes in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of widgets John makes in one day:**\n   - John makes 20 widgets per hour.\n   - He works 8 hours each day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Widgets per day} = 20 \\text{ widgets/hour} \\times 8 \\text{ hours/day} = 160 \\text{ widgets/day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of widgets John makes in a week:**\n   - John works 5 days a week.\n   - He makes 160 widgets each day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Widgets per week} = 160 \\text{ widgets/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 800 \\text{ widgets/week}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of widgets John makes in a week is \\(\\boxed{800}\\).",
