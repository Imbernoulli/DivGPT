During the first hour, the pool fills at a rate of 8 gallons of water per hour. For the next two hours, the pool fills at 10 gallons of water per hour. For the fourth hour, the pool fills at a rate of 14 gallons of water per hour. During the fifth hour, the pool develops a leak and loses 8 gallons of water. At the end of five hours, how many gallons of water are still left in the pool?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
