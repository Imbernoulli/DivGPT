        "To determine how many cups of vegetables Sarah needs to eat per day for the remaining days of the week to meet her daily minimum requirement, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cups of vegetables Sarah needs to eat in a week.\n2. Subtract the number of cups she has already eaten from the total.\n3. Determine how many days are left in the week.\n4. Calculate the number of cups she needs to eat per day for the remaining days.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of cups of vegetables Sarah needs to eat in a week. Since the mentalityüêß recommends eating at least 2 cups of vegetables per day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of cups is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ cups/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 14 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of cups she has already eaten from the total. Sarah has eaten 8 cups from breakfast on Sunday to the end of the day on Thursday. So, the number of cups she still needs to eat is:\n\\[ 14 \\text{ cups} - 8 \\text{ cups} = 6 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nThen, we determine how many days are left in the week. Since she has already eaten from Sunday to Thursday, the number of days left is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ days} - 5 \\text{ days} = 2 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of cups she needs to eat per day for the remaining days. We divide the number of cups she still needs to eat by the number of days left:\n\\[ \\frac{6 \\text{ cups}}{2 \\text{ days}} = 3 \\text{ cups/day} \\]\n\nTherefore, Sarah needs to eat \\(\\boxed{3}\\) cups of vegetables per day for the remaining days of the week to meet her daily minimum requirement.",
