Calculate the total amount of rain Hawaii should have received for the entire year if it had the normal average.\n2. Determine how much more rain is needed to reach this total.\n3. Calculate the average amount of rain needed per day for the remaining days of the year.\n\nFirst, let's find the total amount of rain Hawaii should have received for the entire year if it had the normal average. The normal average is 2 inches of rain per day, and there are 365 days in a year. Therefore, the total expected rain for the year is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ inches/day} \\times 365 \\text{ days} = 730 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Hawaii has already received 430 inches of rain. So, we need to find out how much more rain is needed to reach the total expected amount of 730 inches. This can be calculated by subtracting the amount of rain already received from the total expected rain:\n\\[ 730 \\text{ inches} - 430 \\text{ inches} = 300 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nThere are 100 days left in the year. To find out how many inches of rain Hawaii needs to get on average per day for the remaining days, we divide the total amount of rain needed by the number of days left:\n\\[ \\frac{300 \\text{ inches}}{100 \\text{ days}} = 3 \\text{ inches/day} \\]\n\nTherefore, Hawaii needs to get an average of \\(\\boxed{3}\\) inches of rain per day for the remaining 100 days to finish the year with the normal average.",

Therefore, the total rainfall they will have received by the end of the year is the sum of the rainfall they have already received and the rainfall they will receive in the remaining 100 days.
