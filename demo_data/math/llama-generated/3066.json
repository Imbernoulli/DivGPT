        "To determine the total cost Eugene has to pay after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of each type of item before the discount.\n2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost of each type of item.\n3. Sum the discounted costs of all the items.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item before the discount:\n\n- The cost of one T-shirt is $20. Therefore, the cost of four T-shirts is:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 20 = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\n- The cost of one pair of pants is $80. Therefore, the cost of three pairs of pants is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 80 = 240 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\n- The cost of one pair of shoes is $150. Therefore, the cost of two pairs of shoes is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 150 = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we apply the 10% discount to each total cost. A 10% discount means Eugene pays 90% of the original cost for each item. Therefore, we calculate 90% of each total cost:\n\n- The discounted cost of four T-shirts is:\n  \\[\n  80 \\times 0.90 = 72 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\n- The discounted cost of three pairs of pants is:\n  \\[\n  240 \\times 0.90 = 216 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\n- The discounted cost of two pairs of shoes is:\n  \\[\n  300 \\times 0.90 = 270 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the discounted costs of all the items to find the total amount Eugene has to pay:\n\\[\n72 + 216 + 270 = 558 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount Eugene has to pay is \\(\\boxed{558}\\).",

Eugene buys four T-shirts.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of T-shirts} = 4 \\times 20 = 80\n   \\]\n\n2. The cost of one pair of pants is $80.

Eugene buys two pairs of shoes.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of shoes} = 2 \\times 150 = 300\n   \\]\n\n4. Add the total costs of the T-shirts, pants, and shoes to get the total cost before the discount.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost before discount} = 80 + 240 + 300 = 620\n   \\]\n\n5. Calculate the discount amount. The discount is 10% of the total cost before the discount.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount amount} = 0.10 \\times 620 = 62\n   \\]\n\n6. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount to get the final amount Eugene has to pay.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final amount} = 620 - 62 = 558\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Eugene has to pay is \\(\\boxed{558}\\).",

        "To determine how much Eugene has to pay, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of each type of item before the discount.\n2. Apply the 10% discount to each type of item.\n3. Sum the discounted costs for all items.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item before the discount:\n\n- The cost of one T-shirt is $20. Eugene buys four T-shirts:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 20 = 80\n  \\]\n  So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $80.\n\n- The cost of one pair of pants is $80. Eugene buys three pairs of pants:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 80 = 240\n  \\]\n  So, the total cost of the pants is $240.\n\n- The cost of one pair of shoes is $150. Eugene buys two pairs of shoes:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 150 = 300\n  \\]\n  So, the total cost of the shoes is $300.\n\nNext, we apply the 10% discount to each type of item. A 10% discount means each item costs 90% of its original price. Therefore, we multiply each total cost by 0.90:\n\n- The discounted cost of the T-shirts is:\n  \\[\n  80 \\times 0.90 = 72\n  \\]\n\n- The discounted cost of the pants is:\n  \\[\n  240 \\times 0.90 = 216\n  \\]\n\n- The discounted cost of the shoes is:\n  \\[\n  300 \\times 0.90 = 270\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the discounted costs for all items:\n\\[\n72 + 216 + 270 = 558\n\\]\n\nSo, Eugene has to pay \\(\\boxed{558}\\) dollars.",
