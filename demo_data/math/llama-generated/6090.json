Therefore, she saves:\n\\[ 10 \\times 0.5 = 5 \\text{ dollars per week} \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate how many weeks it will take for Nina to save $55. Since she saves $5 each week, the number of weeks required is:\n\\[ 55 \\div 5 = 11 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Nina \\boxed{11} weeks to be able to buy the new video game with her savings.",
        "To determine how many weeks it will take for Nina to save enough money to buy the video game, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the video game including the sales tax.\n2. Determine how much money Nina can save each week.\n3. Calculate how many weeks it will take for Nina to save the total amount needed.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the video game including the sales tax.**\n\nThe original cost of the video game is $50. The sales tax is 10%. Therefore, the sales tax amount is:\n\\[ 50 \\times 0.10 = 5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the sales tax to the original cost gives us the total cost of the video game:\n\\[ 50 + 5 = 55 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much money Nina can save each week.**\n\nNina receives $10 per week as an allowance and thinks she can save half of that. Therefore, the amount she saves each week is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 0.5 = 5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks it will take for Nina to save the total amount needed.**\n\nTo find out how many weeks it will take for Nina to save $55, we divide the total cost by the amount she saves each week:\n\\[ 55 \\div 5 = 11 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Nina \\(\\boxed{11}\\) weeks to save enough money to buy the new video game.",
