        "Let's start by determining the number of football cards. According to the problem, there are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards. Since there are 200 hockey cards, we can calculate the number of football cards as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of football cards} = 4 \\times \\text{Number of hockey cards} = 4 \\times 200 = 800\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of baseball cards.
