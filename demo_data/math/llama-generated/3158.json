Shanna planted 6 tomato plants and half of them died:\n\\[ 6 - \\left(\\frac{6}{2}\\right) = 6 - 3 = 3 \\]\nSo, 3 tomato plants survived.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of pepper plants that survived. Shanna planted 4 pepper plants and one of them died:\n\\[ 4 - 1 = 3 \\]\nSo, 3 pepper plants survived.\n\nShanna also planted 2 eggplant plants, and none of them died. So, 2 eggplant plants survived.\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of surviving plants:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ (tomato plants)} + 2 \\text{ (eggplant plants)} + 3 \\text{ (pepper plants)} = 8 \\text{ plants} \\]\n\nEach surviving plant gave her 7 vegetables. Therefore, the total number of vegetables harvested is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of vegetables Shanna had to harvest is:\n\\[ \\boxed{56} \\]",
