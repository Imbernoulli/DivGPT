        "To determine the total number of brownies Katy made, we need to consider how many brownies she ate on Monday and Tuesday.\n\n1. Katy eats 5 brownies on Monday.\n2. On Tuesday, she eats twice as many brownies as she did on Monday. Since she ate 5 brownies on Monday, she eats \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) brownies on Tuesday.\n3. After eating the brownies on Tuesday, all of the brownies she made are gone. Therefore, the total number of brownies she made is the sum of the brownies she ate on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nWe can calculate the total number of brownies as follows:\n\\[ 5 + 10 = 15 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of brownies Katy made is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
