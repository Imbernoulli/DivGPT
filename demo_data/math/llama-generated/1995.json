        "To determine how much steak John ate, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of steak that is not burned.\n2. Determine how much of the unburned steak John eats.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount of steak that is not burned.**\n\nJohn's original steak weighs 30 ounces. Since the grill burns half of the steak, we need to find half of 30 ounces:\n\\[\n\\text{Unburned steak} = \\frac{30 \\text{ ounces}}{2} = 15 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much of the unburned steak John eats.**\n\nJohn eats 80% of the unburned steak. To find 80% of 15 ounces, we multiply 15 ounces by 0.80:\n\\[\n\\text{Steak eaten} = 15 \\text{ ounces} \\times 0.80 = 12 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of steak John ate is \\boxed{12} ounces.",

        "To determine how much steak John ate, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of steak that is not burned.\n2. Determine how much of the unburned steak John eats.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount of steak that is not burned.**\n\nThe original steak is 30 ounces. Since the grill burns half of the steak, the amount of steak that is not burned is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ ounces} \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 30 \\text{ ounces} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 15 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much of the unburned steak John eats.**\n\nJohn eats 80% of the unburned steak. Therefore, the amount of steak he eats is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ ounces} \\times 0.80 = 12 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nSo, the amount of steak John ate is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) ounces.",
