        "To determine the total time Tom took to renovate the house, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the time taken to renovate the bedrooms:\n   - There are 3 bedrooms, and each takes 4 hours to renovate.\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ bedrooms} \\times 4 \\text{ hours/bedroom} = 12 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the time taken to renovate the kitchen:\n   - The kitchen takes 50% longer than each bedroom.\n   - First, find 50% of the time it takes to renovate one bedroom:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ hours} \\times 0.5 = 2 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n   - Add this to the time it takes to renovate one bedroom to get the total time for the kitchen:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n3. Calculate the total time taken to renovate the bedrooms and the kitchen:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ hours} + 6 \\text{ hours} = 18 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the time taken to renovate the living room:\n   - The living room took twice as much time as everything else combined.\n   - everything else combined is 18 hours, so:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 18 \\text{ hours} = 36 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n5. Calculate the total time taken to renovate the entire house:\n   \\[\n   18 \\text{ hours} + 36 \\text{ hours} = 54 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total time Tom took to renovate the house is \\(\\boxed{54}\\) hours."
