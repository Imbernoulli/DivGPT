        "To determine how much Shara saved on the pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the original price of the shoes before the discount.**\n\n   Let \\( P \\) be the original price of the shoes.

Determine the savings amount.\n\nLet's denote the original price of the shoes as \\( P \\).\n\nSince Shara paid $184 after an 8% discount, the amount she paid is 92% of the original price (because 100% - 8% = 92%). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 0.92P = 184 \\]\n\nTo find the original price \\( P \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.92:\n\\[ P = \\frac{184}{0.92} = 200 \\]\n\nSo, the original price of the shoes was $200. The amount Shara saved is the difference between the original price and the price she paid:\n\\[ \\text{Savings} = P - 184 = 200 - 184 = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, Shara saved \\(\\boxed{16}\\) dollars.",
