        "To determine how many cans Jack recycled, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cans Jack recycled as \\( c \\).\n\nJack earns 10 cents per bottle and 5 cents per can. He recycled 80 bottles, so the total earnings from the bottles is:\n\\[ 80 \\times 10 = 800 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nSince there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert the earnings from bottles to dollars:\n\\[ 800 \\text{ cents} = 8 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nJack's total earnings from recycling both bottles and cans is $15. Therefore, the earnings from the cans is:\n\\[ 15 - 8 = 7 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince Jack earns 5 cents per can, the total number of cans he recycled is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ dollars} \\times \\frac{100 \\text{ cents}}{1 \\text{ dollar}} \\div 5 \\text{ cents per can} = 7 \\times 20 = 140 \\text{ cans} \\]\n\nThus, the number of cans Jack recycled is:\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]",

According to the problem, Jack gets 10 cents per bottle and 5 cents per can. He recycled 80 bottles and made a total of $15. First, we convert the total amount of money from dollars to cents to make the calculations easier. Since $15 is equivalent to 1500 cents, we can write the equation for the total amount of money as follows:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 80 + 5 \\times c = 1500 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of money Jack received from recycling the bottles:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 80 = 800 \\]\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 800 + 5c = 1500 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( c \\), we need to isolate \\( c \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 800 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 5c = 1500 - 800 \\]\n\\[ 5c = 700 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( c \\) by dividing both sides by 5:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{700}{5} \\]\n\\[ c = 140 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cans Jack recycled is \\(\\boxed{140}\\).",

        "To determine how many cans Jack recycled, we start by calculating the total amount of money Jack earned from recycling the bottles. Since he gets 10 cents per bottle and he recycled 80 bottles, we can calculate the earnings from the bottles as follows:\n\n\\[ 80 \\text{ bottles} \\times 10 \\text{ cents per bottle} = 800 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNext, we convert the total earnings from dollars to cents. Jack made $15, which is equivalent to:\n\n\\[ 15 \\text{ dollars} \\times 100 \\text{ cents per dollar} = 1500 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the earnings from the bottles from the total earnings to find out how much money Jack earned from recycling the cans:\n\n\\[ 1500 \\text{ cents} - 800 \\text{ cents} = 700 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nSince Jack gets 5 cents per can, we can find the number of cans he recycled by dividing the earnings from the cans by the amount he gets per can:\n\n\\[ 700 \\text{ cents} \\div 5 \\text{ cents per can} = 140 \\text{ cans} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cans Jack recycled is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]"
