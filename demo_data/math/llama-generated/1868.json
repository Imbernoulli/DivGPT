        "To determine how long it will take for the pot to be full, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the volume of water calmly by the leak in one minute.\n2. Determine the total volume of the pot in milliliters.\n3. Calculate the time it takes to fill the pot by dividing the total volume of the pot by the volume of water Leaked in one minute.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the volume of water Leaked in one minute.**\n\nThe leak drops 3 drops per minute, and each drop is 20 ml. Therefore, the volume of water Leaked in one minute is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ drops/minute} \\times 20 \\text{ ml/drop} = 60 \\text{ ml/minute} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total volume of the pot in milliliters.**\n\nThe pot holds 3 liters. Since 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, the total volume of the pot is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ liters} \\times 1000 \\text{ ml/liter} = 3000 \\text{ ml} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to fill the pot.**\n\nTo find out how long it will take to fill the pot, we divide the total volume of the pot by the volume of water Leaked in one minute:\n\\[ \\frac{3000 \\text{ ml}}{60 \\text{ ml/minute}} = 50 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take the pot \\(\\boxed{50}\\) minutes to be full.",
