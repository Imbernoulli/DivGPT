Once a month, his fiery chariot’s wheels need to be replaced. He trades golden apples to Hephaestus the blacksmith to get Hephaestus to make him new wheels. Hephaestus raised his rates halfway through the year and now demands twice as many golden apples as before. He charged three golden apples for the first six months. How many golden apples does Apollo have to pay for the entire year of chariot wheels?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total number of golden apples Apollo has to pay for the entire year of chariot wheels, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first six months and the second six months.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of golden apples Apollo pays for the first six months. Since he pays three golden apples per month for the first six months, we multiply the number of months by the number of golden apples per month:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ apples/month} \\times 6 \\text{ months} = 18 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of golden apples Apollo pays for the second six months. Since Hephaestus raised his rates to twice as many golden apples halfway through the year, he now charges \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) golden apples per month. Therefore, we multiply the number of months by the new number of golden apples per month:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ apples/month} \\times 6 \\text{ months} = 36 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the golden apples paid for the first six months and the second six months to find the total number of golden apples paid for the entire year:\n\\[\n18 \\text{ apples} + 36 \\text{ apples} = 54 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of golden apples Apollo has to pay for the entire year of chariot wheels is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of golden apples Apollo has to pay for the entire year of chariot wheels, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first six months and the cost for the last six months.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost for the first six months. Hephaestus charged 3 golden apples per month for the first six months. Since Apollo needs new wheels once a month, the total cost for the first six months is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ apples/month} \\times 6 \\text{ months} = 18 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost for the last six months.

Therefore, he now charges:\n\\[\n2 \\times 3 \\text{ apples/month} = 6 \\text{ apples/month}\n\\]\nSince Apollo needs new wheels once a month, the total cost for the last six months is:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ apples/month} \\times 6 \\text{ months} = 36 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the costs for the first six months and the last six months to find the total cost for the entire year:\n\\[\n18 \\text{ apples} + 36 \\text{ apples} = 54 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of golden apples Apollo has to pay for the entire year of chariot wheels is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{54}\n\\]",

Hephaestus charged 3 golden apples per month for the first six months. Therefore, the total cost for the first six months is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ apples/month} \\times 6 \\text{ months} = 18 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost for the last six months. Hephaestus raised his rates to twice the original amount, so he now charges \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) golden apples per month for the last six months. Therefore, the total cost for the last six months is:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ apples/month} \\times 6 \\text{ months} = 36 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the costs for the first six months and the last six months to find the total cost for the entire year:\n\\[\n18 \\text{ apples} + 36 \\text{ apples} = 54 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of golden apples Apollo has to pay for the entire year of chariot wheels is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
