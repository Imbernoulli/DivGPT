        "To determine how many puppies Dorchester washed on Wednesday, we start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Dorchester's total earnings for the day can be expressed as the sum of his fixed daily pay and the amount he earns from washing puppies.\n\nLet's denote the number of puppies Dorchester washed on Wednesday as \\( p \\). According to the problem, Dorchester earns $40 per day plus $2.25 for each puppy he washes. Therefore, his total earnings for the day can be written as:\n\\[ 40 + 2.25p \\]\n\nWe know from the problem that Dorchester earned $76 on Wednesday. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 40 + 2.25p = 76 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve for \\( p \\). First, we isolate the term with \\( p \\) by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2.25p = 76 - 40 \\]\n\\[ 2.25p = 36 \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( p \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.25:\n\\[ p = \\frac{36}{2.25} \\]\n\\[ p = 16 \\]\n\nSo, Dorchester washed \\(\\boxed{16}\\) puppies on Wednesday.",
