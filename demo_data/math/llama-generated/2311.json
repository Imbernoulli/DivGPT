        "To determine the total amount John spends on silver and gold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of gold John buys:**\n   John buys twice as much gold as silver. Since he buys 1.5 ounces of silver:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount of gold} = 2 \\times 1.5 = 3 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the cost per ounce of gold:**\n   The gold is 50 times more expensive per ounce than silver. Since the silver costs $20 per ounce:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per ounce of gold} = 50 \\times 20 = 1000 \\text{ dollars per ounce}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the silver:**\n   John buys 1.5 ounces of silver at $20 per ounce:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of silver} = 1.5 \\times 20 = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of the gold:**\n   John buys 3 ounces of gold at $1000 per ounce:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of gold} = 3 \\times 1000 = 3000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the total amount spent on both silver and gold:**\n   Add the total cost of the silver and the total cost of the gold:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount spent} = 30 + 3000 = 3030 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount John spends on everything is \\(\\boxed{3030}\\).",

Determine the cost of the gold.\n4. Add the cost of the silver and the cost of the gold to find the total amount spent.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount of gold John buys.**\n\nJohn buys 1.5 ounces of silver and twice as much gold.\n\\[\n\\text{Amount of gold} = 2 \\times 1.5 = 3 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost of the silver.**\n\nThe silver costs $20 per ounce.\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of silver} = 1.5 \\times 20 = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the cost of the gold.**\n\nThe gold is 50 times more expensive per ounce than silver. Since the silver costs $20 per ounce, the gold costs:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per ounce of gold} = 50 \\times 20 = 1000 \\text{ dollars per ounce}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of gold} = 3 \\times 1000 = 3000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Add the cost of the silver and the cost of the gold to find the total amount spent.**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of silver} + \\text{Cost of gold} = 30 + 3000 = 3030 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount John spends on everything is \\boxed{3030}."
