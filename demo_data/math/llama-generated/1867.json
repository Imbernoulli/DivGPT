        "To determine the total number of basketballs donated, we need to consider each type of donation and how they contribute to the total number of basketballs.\n\n1. **Basketball Hoops:**\n   - There are 60 basketball hoops.\n   - Half of these basketball hoops also included basketballs.\n   - Therefore, the number of basketballs included with the basketball hoops is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n     \\]\n\n2. **Terms Floats:**\n   - There are 120 pool floats donated.\n   - A quarter of these pool floats were damaged and discarded.\n   - The number of damaged pool floats is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{120}{4} = 30\n     \\]\n   - The number of pool floats remaining is:\n     \\[\n     120 - 30 = 90\n     \\]\n   - Since pool floats do not contribute to the number of basketballs.\n\n3. **-O盼望 balls:**\n   - There are 50 footballs donated.\n   - There are 40 tennis balls donated.\n   - The number of footballs and tennis balls together is:\n     \\[\n     50 + 40 = 90\n     \\]\n\n4. **Remaining Donations:**\n   - The total number of donations is 300.\n   - The total number of basketball hoops (including the basketballs) is 60.\n   - The total number of footballs and tennis balls is 90.\n   - The total number of pool floats remaining is 90.\n   - Therefore, the number of remaining donations is:\n     \\[\n     300 - (60 + 90 + 90) = 60\n     \\]\n   - These remaining donations are basketballs.\n   - Since 30 basketballs were included with the basketball hoops, the total number of basketballs donated is:\n     \\[\n     30 + \\text{remaining basketballs} = 30 + 60 = 90\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of basketballs donated is \\boxed{90}.",

        "To determine the total number of basketballs donated, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we know the total number of donations is 300. We are given the following information about the specific donations:\n- 60 basketball hoops, and half of these also had basketballs included as part of the donation.\n- 120 pool floats were donated, but a quarter of these were damaged and discarded.\n- 50 footballs were donated.\n- 40 tennis balls were donated.\n- The remaining donations were basketballs.\n\nLet's calculate the number of basketballs included with the basketball hoops. Since half of the 60 basketball hoops also had basketballs included, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\text{ basketballs} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of pool floats that were not discarded. Since a quarter of the pool floats were damaged and discarded, three quarters were not discarded:\n\\[ 120 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = 120 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 90 \\text{ pool floats} \\]\n\nNow, we sum up all the donations that are not basketballs:\n- Basketball hoops: 60\n- Pool floats: 90\n- Footballs: 50\n- Tennis balls: 40\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[ 60 + 90 + 50 + 40 = 240 \\]\n\nSince the total number of donations is 300, the number of basketballs donated is:\n\\[ 300 - 240 = 60 \\]\n\nHowever, we already calculated that 30 basketballs were included with the basketball hoops.

        "To determine the total number of basketballs donated, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the total number of donations:**\n   The total number of donations is 300.\n\n2. **Analyze the basketball hoops:**\n   There are 60 basketball hoops, and half of these also had basketballs included as part of the donation.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of basketball hoops with basketballs} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the number of basketballs included with the basketball hoops is 30.\n\n3. **Analyze the pool floats:**\n   There are 120 pool floats donated, but a quarter of these were damaged and were discarded.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of damaged pool floats} = \\frac{120}{4} = 30\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the number of pool floats remaining is:\n   \\[\n   120 - 30 = 90\n   \\]\n\n4. **Identify the other donations:**\n   The remaining donations are basketballs, footballs, and tennis balls.

Therefore, the number of remaining basketballs is:\n     \\[\n     300 - (60 + 90 + 50 + 40) = 300 - 240 = 60\n     \\]\n   - Adding the basketballs included in the basketball hoops, the total number of basketballs donated is:\n     \\[\n     30 + 60 = 90\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of basketballs donated is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of basketballs donated, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of basketball hoops donated.\n2. Determine how many basketballs were included with the basketball hoops.\n3. Identify the number of pool floats donated and how many were discarded.\n4. Identify the number of footballs and tennis balls donated.\n5. Calculate the remaining donations, which are basketballs.\n\nLet's start with the basketball hoops:\n- The school received 60 basketball hoops.\n- Half of these basketball hoops also had basketballs included as part of the donation.\n- Therefore, the number of basketballs included with the basketball hoops is \\(60 \\div 2 = 30\\).\n\nNext, let's consider the pool floats:\n- The school received 120 pool floats.\n- A quarter of these pool floats were damaged and discarded.\n- Therefore, the number of pool floats discarded is \\(120 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 30\\).\n- The number of pool floats remaining is \\(120 - 30 = 90\\).\n\nNow, let's look at the footballs and tennis balls:\n- The school received 50 footballs.\n- The school received 40 tennis balls.\n\nThe remaining donations are basketballs. We know the total number of donations is 300. So, we can calculate the number of basketballs by subtracting the number of basketball hoops, pool floats, footballs, and tennis balls from the total number of donations:\n- The total number of basketballs is \\(300 - 60 - 90 - 50 - 40 = 60\\).\n\nHowever, we need to add the basketballs that were included with the basketball hoops to the remaining basketballs:\n- The total number of basketballs is \\(60 + 30 = 90\\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of basketballs donated is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of basketballs donated, we will break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Total donations**: There are 300 donations in total.\n\n2. **Basketball hoops**: There are 60 basketball hoops. Half of these also had basketballs included:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n   So, 30 basketball hoops had basketballs included.\n\n3. **Pool floats**: There are 120 pool floats, but a quarter of them were damaged and discarded:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120}{4} = 30\n   \\]\n   Therefore, 30 pool floats were discarded, leaving:\n   \\[\n   120 - 30 = 90\n   \\]\n   So, 90 pool floats were not discarded.\n\n4. ** other sports equipment**: There are 50 footballs and 40 tennis balls. The remaining donations are basketballs.\n\n5. **Calculate the remaining donations**: First, we sum up the donations we already know:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ (basketball hoops)} + 90 \\text{ (pool floats)} + 50 \\text{ (footballs)} + 40 \\text{ (tennis balls)} = 240\n   \\]\n   The remaining donations are:\n   \\[\n   300 - 240 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, there are 60 basketballs donated that were not included with the basketball hoops.\n\n6. **Total number of basketballs**: Add the basketballs included with the basketball hoops to the basketballs donated that were not included with the basketball hoops:\n   \\[\n   30 + 60 = 90\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of basketballs donated is \\boxed{90}.",
        "To determine the total number of basketballs donated, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the number of basketball hoops and basketballs included in the donations:**\n   - The school received 60 basketball hoops.\n   - Half of these basketball hoops also included basketballs. Therefore, the number of basketballs included is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n     \\]\n\n2. **Identify the number of pool floats donated and the number of damaged pool floats:**\n   - The school received 120 pool floats.\n   - A quarter of these pool floats were damaged and discarded. Therefore, the number of damaged pool floats is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{120}{4} = 30\n     \\]\n   - The number of pool floats that were not damaged is:\n     \\[\n     120 - 30 = 90\n     \\]\n\n3. **Identify the number of footballs and tennis balls donated:**\n   - The school received 50 footballs.\n   - The school received 40 tennis balls.\n\n4. **Determine the number of remaining donations that were basketballs:**\n   - The total number of donations is 300.\n   - The number of donations that were basketball hoops (60) person pool floats (90), footballs (50), and tennis balls (40) is:\n     \\[\n     60 + 90 + 50 + 40 = 240\n     \\]\n   - The number of remaining donations that were basketballs is:\n     \\[\n     300 - 240 = 60\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of basketballs donated:**\n   - The total number of basketballs donated includes the 30 basketballs that were included with the basketball hoops and the 60 basketballs that were donated separately. Therefore, the total number of basketballs donated is:\n     \\[\n     30 + 60 = 90\n     \\]\n\nThe total number of basketballs donated is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of basketballs donated, we need to analyze the information given step by step.\n\n1. **Total donations**: The school received 300 donations.\n\n2. **Basketball hoops**: There are 60 basketball hoops. Half of these were donated with basketballs included:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n   So, 30 basketball hoops came with basketballs.\n\n3. **𝘿 pool floats**: There were 120 pool floats donated, but a quarter of these were damaged and discarded:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120}{4} = 30\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the number of usable pool floats is:\n   \\[\n   120 - 30 = 90\n   \\]\n\n4. **_phase footballs**: There are 50 footballs.\n\n5. **Tennis balls**: There are 40 tennis balls.\n\n6. **Remaining donations**: The remaining donations are basketballs.
