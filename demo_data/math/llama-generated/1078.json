Therefore, the distance Karen bikes from the library back to her home is 1600 miles.\n\nSince Karen bikes from her home to the library and back, we need to double the distance she bikes one way to find the total distance she covers:\n\n\\[\n1600 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 3200 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total distance that Karen covers is \\(\\boxed{3200}\\).",
        "To find the total distance that Karen covers when she bikes from her home to the library and back, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of books on the four shelves.\n2. Use this total number of books as the distance in miles that Karen bikes back to her home from the library.\n3. Calculate the total distance Karen covers for a round trip.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of books on the four shelves. Since each shelf has 400 books and there are four shelves, we multiply the number of books per shelf by the number of shelves:\n\n\\[\n400 \\text{ books/shelf} \\times 4 \\text{ shelves} = 1600 \\text{ books}\n\\]\n\nThis means that the distance Karen bikes back to her home from the library is 1600 miles. Since she bikes from her home to the library and then back home, the total distance she covers is twice the distance from her home to the library:\n\n\\[\n1600 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 3200 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance that Karen covers is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3200}\n\\]",

Use the total number of books to find the distance Karen bikes back to her home from the library.\n3. Calculate the total distance Karen covers for a round trip.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of books on the four shelves.**\n\nEach shelf has 400 books, and there are four shelves. Therefore, the total number of books is:\n\\[ 400 \\text{ books/shelf} \\times 4 \\text{ shelves} = 1600 \\text{ books} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Use the total number of books to find the distance Karen bikes back to her home from the library.**\n\nThe problem states that the total number of books on the four shelves is the same as the distance in miles that Karen bikes back to her home from the library. Therefore, the distance Karen bikes back to her home from the library is:\n\\[ 1600 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total distance Karen covers for a round trip.**\n\nA round trip means Karen bikes from her home to the library and then back to her home. So, the total distance she covers is:\n\\[ 1600 \\text{ miles} + 1600 \\text{ miles} = 3200 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThus, the total distance that Karen covers is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3200} \\]"
