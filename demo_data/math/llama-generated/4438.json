        "To determine the total number of people needed to lift 6 cars and 3 trucks, we start by calculating the number of people required for each type of vehicle.\n\nFirst, we know that it takes 5 people to lift one car. Therefore, the number of people needed to lift 6 cars is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ people/car} \\times 6 \\text{ cars} = 30 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nNext, we know that it takes twice as many people to lift a truck as it does to lift a car. Since it takes 5 people to lift a car, it takes:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 \\text{ people} = 10 \\text{ people} \\]\nto lift one truck. Therefore, the number of people needed to lift 3 trucks is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ people/truck} \\times 3 \\text{ trucks} = 30 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nTo find the total number of people needed to lift 6 cars and 3 trucks, we add the number of people required for the cars and the number of people required for the trucks:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ people} + 30 \\text{ people} = 60 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of people needed to lift 6 cars and 3 trucks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",
        "To determine how many people are needed to lift 6 cars and 3 trucks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of people required to lift one truck:**\n   - It takes 5 people to lift one car.\n   - It takes twice as many people to lift a truck.\n   - Therefore, the number of people needed to lift one truck is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 5 = 10\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of people required to lift 6 cars:**\n   - It takes 5 people to lift one car.\n   - Therefore, the number of people needed to lift 6 cars is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 5 = 30\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of people required to lift 3 trucks:**\n   - It takes 10 people to lift one truck.\n   - Therefore, the number of people needed to lift 3 trucks is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 10 = 30\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of people required to lift 6 cars and 3 trucks:**\n   - The total number of people needed for 6 cars is 30.\n   - The total number of people needed for 3 trucks is 30.\n   - Therefore, the total number of people needed to lift 6 cars and 3 trucks is:\n     \\[\n     30 + 30 = 60\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of people needed to lift 6 cars and 3 trucks is \\boxed{60}.",
        "To determine the total number of people needed to lift 6 cars and 3 trucks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of people required to lift one truck.\n2. Calculate the number of people required to lift 6 cars.\n3. Calculate the number of people required to lift 3 trucks.\n4. Add the number of people required for the cars and the trucks.\n\nFirst, we know that it takes 5 people to lift a car. Since it takes twice as many people to lift a truck, we can calculate the number of people required to lift one truck as follows:\n\\[ 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\]\nSo, it takes 10 people to lift one truck.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of people required to lift 6 cars. Since each car requires 5 people, we can calculate the total number of people required for 6 cars as follows:\n\\[ 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\]\nSo, it takes 30 people to lift 6 cars.\n\nThen, we need to calculate the number of people required to lift 3 trucks. Since each truck requires 10 people, we can calculate the total number of people required for 3 trucks as follows:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\]\nSo, it takes 30 people to lift 3 trucks.\n\nFinally, we add the number of people required for the cars and the trucks to find the total number of people needed:\n\\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people needed to lift 6 cars and 3 trucks is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
        "To determine the number of people needed to lift 6 cars and 3 trucks, we start by finding out how many people are required to lift one truck. According to the problem, it takes twice as many people to lift a truck as it does to lift a car. Since it takes 5 people to lift a car, it takes \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) people to lift a truck.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of people needed to lift 6 cars. Since each car requires 5 people, 6 cars will require \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\) people.\n\nThen, we calculate the total number of people needed to lift 3 trucks. Since each truck requires 10 people, 3 trucks will require \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\) people.\n\nFinally, we add the number of people needed to lift the cars and the number of people needed to lift the trucks to get the total number of people required.
