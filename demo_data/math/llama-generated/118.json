        "To determine the total number of flowers that bloom because of the unicorns' trip, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total distance each unicorn travels:**\n   The unicorns are traveling 9 kilometers. Since each kilometer is equal to 1000 meters, we convert kilometers to meters:\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ kilometers} = 9 \\times 1000 = 9000 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of steps each unicorn takes:**\n   Each unicorn moves 3 meters with each step. To find the number of steps each unicorn takes, we divide the total distance by the distance per step:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of steps per unicorn} = \\frac{9000 \\text{ meters}}{3 \\text{ meters/step}} = 3000 \\text{ steps}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of steps taken by all six unicorns:**\n   Since there are six unicorns, we multiply the number of steps each unicorn takes by the total number of unicorns:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of steps} = 3000 \\text{ steps/unicorn} \\times 6 \\text{ unicorns} = 18000 \\text{ steps}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the total number of flowers that bloom:**\n   Each step by a unicorn causes 4 flowers to bloom. Therefore, we multiply the total number of steps by the number of flowers per step:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of flowers} = 18000 \\text{ steps} \\times 4 \\text{ flowers/step} = 72000 \\text{ flowers}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of flowers that bloom because of the unicorns' trip is \\(\\boxed{72000}\\).",
