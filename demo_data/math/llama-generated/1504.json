Subtract the amount paid by John's friend from the total rental fee to find out how much John paid.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. **Calculate the weekly rental fee:**\n   The rental fee is 10% of the value of the camera per week. The camera is worth $5000.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly rental fee} = 0.10 \\times 5000 = 500\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total rental fee for 4 weeks:**\n   Since the weekly rental fee is $500, for 4 weeks the total rental fee is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total rental fee} = 500 \\times 4 = 2000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how much John's friend paid:**\n   John's friend agreed to pay 40% of the total rental fee. So, we calculate 40% of $2000:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount paid by John's friend} = 0.40 \\times 2000 = 800\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the amount paid by John's friend from the total rental fee to find out how much John paid:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount paid by John} = 2000 - 800 = 1200\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount John paid is \\(\\boxed{1200}\\).",
