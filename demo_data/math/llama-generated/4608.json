        "To determine how much Annie will pay for 12 kg of oranges, we start by understanding the relationship between the price paid and the mass of oranges purchased. The problem states that the price paid is proportional to the mass purchased. This means that the ratio of the price to the mass is constant.\n\nFirst, we find the constant of proportionality. Annie paid $6 for 2 kg of oranges. Therefore, the constant of proportionality \\( k \\) is given by:\n\\[\nk = \\frac{\\text{price}}{\\text{mass}} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\nThis means that the price per kilogram of oranges is $3.\n\nNext, we use this constant to find out how much Annie will pay for 12 kg of oranges. Since the price is $3 per kilogram, the total price for 12 kg is:\n\\[\n\\text{total price} = 3 \\times 12 = 36\n\\]\nThus, Annie will pay \\(\\boxed{36}\\) dollars for 12 kg of oranges.",
