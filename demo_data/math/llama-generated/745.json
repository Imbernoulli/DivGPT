Determine how many school days are needed to meet the total driving requirement.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the total driving requirement from hours to minutes.**\n\n owes 50 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 50 by 60:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 3000 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total driving time for a round trip to and from school.**\n\nIt takes 20 minutes to drive to school. Therefore, a round trip (to school and back) takes:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} = 40 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many school days are needed to meet the total driving requirement.**\n\nTo find out how many school days it will take Jessica to drive 3000 minutes, we divide 3000 by 40:\n\\[ 3000 \\text{ minutes} \\div 40 \\text{ minutes/day} = 75 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nThus, it will take Jessica \\(\\boxed{75}\\) school days to meet the 50-hour driving requirement.",

Calculate the total driving time for a round trip to and from school each day.\n2. Determine how many school days are needed to accumulate 50 hours of driving.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total driving time for a round trip:\n- It takes 20 minutes to drive to school.\n- It takes 20 minutes to drive back home.\n- Therefore, the total driving time for a round trip is \\(20 + 20 = 40\\) minutes.\n\nNext, we need to convert the total driving time from minutes to hours:\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n- So, \\(40\\) minutes is \\(\\frac{40}{60} = \\frac{2}{3}\\) hours.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many school days it will take for Jessica to accumulate 50 hours of driving. Let \\(d\\) be the number of school days. Then, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3}d = 50\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(d\\), we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), which is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\):\n\\[\nd = 50 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 50 \\times 1.5 = 75\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jessica \\(\\boxed{75}\\) school days to meet the 50-hour driving requirement.",
