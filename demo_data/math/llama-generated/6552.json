        "To determine how many pfennigs Gerald will have left after buying the pie, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the amount of farthings Gerald has into pfennigs.\n2. Subtract the cost of the pie from the amount of pfennigs Gerald has.\n\nFirst, let's convert the farthings into pfennigs. We know that there are 6 farthings in a pfennig. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pfennigs Gerald has by dividing the total number of farthings by the number of farthings per pfennig:\n\\[ 54 \\text{ farthings} \\div 6 \\text{ farthings/pfennig} = 9 \\text{ pfennigs} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the cost of the pie from the number of pfennigs Gerald has. The pie costs 2 pfennigs, so we subtract 2 from 9:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ pfennigs} - 2 \\text{ pfennigs} = 7 \\text{ pfennigs} \\]\n\nTherefore, after buying the pie, Gerald will have \\(\\boxed{7}\\) pfennigs left.",

The pie costs 2 pfennigs, so we subtract 2 from 9:\n\\[ 9 - 2 = 7 \\]\nSo, after buying the pie, Gerald will have \\(\\boxed{7}\\) pfennigs left.",
