        "To determine how much higher Jason will be than Matt after 7 minutes, we need to calculate the height each person has climbed and then find the difference between these heights.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how high Matt has climbed in 7 minutes. Matt's climbing rate is 6 feet per minute. Therefore, in 7 minutes, Matt will have climbed:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ feet/minute} \\times 7 \\text{ minutes} = 42 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate how high Jason has climbed in 7 minutes. Jason's climbing rate is 12 feet per minute. Therefore, in 7 minutes, Jason will have climbed:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ feet/minute} \\times 7 \\text{ minutes} = 84 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much higher Jason is than Matt. We do this by subtracting the height Matt has climbed from the height Jason has climbed:\n\\[ 84 \\text{ feet} - 42 \\text{ feet} = 42 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nSo, after 7 minutes, Jason will be \\(\\boxed{42}\\) feet higher than Matt.",
