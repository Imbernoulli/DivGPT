        "To determine the total cost of 6 candy bars, 3 caramel, and 1 cotton candy, we start by finding the individual prices of each item based on the given information.\n\n1. **Price of caramel:**\n   The price of 1 caramel is given as \\( \\$3 \\).\n\n2. **Price of candy bars:**\n   The price of candy bars is twice the cost of caramel. Therefore, the price of 1 candy bar is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3 = \\$6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Price of cotton candy:**\n   The cost of cotton candy is half the price of 4 candy bars.
