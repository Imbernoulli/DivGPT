Since Jameson's sword is 3 inches longer than twice the length of Christopher's sword, we can write:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of Jameson's sword} = 2 \\times \\text{Length of Christopher's sword} + 3\n\\]\nSubstituting the length of Christopher's sword (15 inches) into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of Jameson's sword} = 2 \\times 15 + 3 = 30 + 3 = 33 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the length of June's sword. Since June's sword is 5 inches longer than Jameson's sword, we can write:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of June's sword} = \\text{Length of Jameson's sword} + 5\n\\]\nSubstituting the length of Jameson's sword (33 inches) into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of June's sword} = 33 + 5 = 38 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find out how many inches longer June's sword is than Christopher's sword by subtracting the length of Christopher's sword from the length of June's sword:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Length of June's sword} - \\text{Length of Christopher's sword} = 38 - 15 = 23 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThus, June's sword is \\(\\boxed{23}\\) inches longer than Christopher's sword.",

Therefore, the length of Jameson's sword \\( J \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ J = 2C + 3 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( C \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ J = 2(15) + 3 = 30 + 3 = 33 \\]\nSo, the length of Jameson's sword is 33 inches.\n\nNow, we use the information that June's sword is 5 inches longer than Jameson's sword. Therefore, the length of June's sword \\( Re \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ Re = J + 5 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( J \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ Re = 33 + 5 = 38 \\]\nSo, the length of June's sword is 38 inches.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how many inches longer June's sword is than Christopher's sword.
