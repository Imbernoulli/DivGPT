The remaining area \\( A_{\\text{remaining}} \\) is:\n\\[ A_{\\text{remaining}} = \\text{total area} - \\text{area already laid} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[ A_{\\text{remaining}} = 320 \\, \\text{sq ft} - 250 \\, \\text{sq ft} = 70 \\, \\text{sq ft} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many boxes of flooring are required for the remaining area.**\n\nEach box covers 10 square feet. The number of boxes \\( n \\) needed is:\n\\[ n = \\frac{\\text{remaining area}}{\\text{area per box}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[ n = \\frac{70 \\, \\text{sq ft}}{10 \\, \\text{sq ft/box}} = 7 \\, \\text{boxes} \\]\n\nTherefore, Tom needs \\(\\boxed{7}\\) more boxes of hardwood flooring to complete the job.",
