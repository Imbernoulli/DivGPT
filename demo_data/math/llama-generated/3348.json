So, the discount amount per kilogram is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ dollars} \\times \\frac{40}{100} = 5 \\text{ dollars} \\times 0.40 = 2 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the discounted price per kilogram:**\n   The discounted price per kilogram is the original price minus the discount amount:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ dollars} - 2 \\text{ dollars} = 3 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the total cost for 10 kilograms at the discounted price:**\n   The total cost for 10 kilograms at the discounted price is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ kg} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/kg} = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Hannah would pay for 10 kilograms of apples after the discount is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
