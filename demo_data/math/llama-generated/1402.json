A certain school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library and also bought twice as many for the elementary library. Since the school bought more than 5 models, there was a 5% reduction in price for each model. How much did the school pay in all?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Determine the discounted price per model.\n3. Calculate the total cost with the discount applied.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of models purchased. The school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library and twice as many for the elementary library. Therefore, the number of models bought for the elementary library is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\]\nSo, the total number of models bought is:\n\\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \\]\n\nSince the school bought more than 5 models, there is a 5% reduction in price for each model. The original price of each model is $100, so the discounted price per model is:\n\\[ 100 - (100 \\times 0.05) = 100 - 5 = 95 \\]\nNow, we calculate the total cost for 6 models at the discounted price:\n\\[ 6 \\times 95 = 570 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount the school paid is:\n\\[ \\boxed{570} \\]",

Since the school bought 2 models for the kindergarten library, the number of models bought for the elementary library is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\]\n\nNext, we determine the total number of models bought by adding the models bought for the kindergarten library and the elementary library:\n\\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \\]\n\nSince the school bought more than 5 models, they qualify for a 5% reduction in price for each model. The original price of each model is $100, so the discount per model is:\n\\[ 100 \\times 0.05 = 5 \\]\nThe reduced price per model is:\n\\[ 100 - 5 = 95 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for all the models bought:\n\\[ 6 \\times 95 = 570 \\]\n\nTherefore, the school paid \\(\\boxed{570}\\) dollars in all.",
