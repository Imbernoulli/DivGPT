        "To determine the number of adults who did not wear blue at the Johnson family reunion, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of adults.\n2. Determine how many adults wore blue.\n3. Subtract the number of adults who wore blue from the total number of adults to find the number of adults who did not wear blue.\n\nFirst, we know that there were 45 children and one third as many adults. Therefore, the number of adults is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of adults} = \\frac{45}{3} = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these adults wore blue. Since one third of the adults wore blue, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of adults who wore blue} = \\frac{15}{3} = 5\n\\]\n\nFinally, to find the number of adults who did not wear blue, we subtract the number of adults who wore blue from the total number of adults:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of adults who did not wear blue} = 15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of adults who did not wear blue is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",
