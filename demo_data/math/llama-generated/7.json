        "To determine how many pieces of rope Tom needs to buy, we start by calculating the total length of rope required.

Each piece of rope is 20 feet long, but 25% of the length is lost when lashing two pieces together. This means that after lashing two pieces, the total length available is:\n\n\\[ 20 \\text{ feet} + 20 \\text{ feet} - (0.25 \\times 20 \\text{ feet}) = 40 \\text{ feet} - 5 \\text{ feet} = 35 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nIf we lash three pieces together, the total length available is:\n\n\\[ 35 \\text{ feet} + 20 \\text{ feet} - (0.25 \\times 20 \\text{ feet}) = 55 \\text{ feet} - 5 \\text{ feet} = 50 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nIf we lash four pieces together, the total length available is:\n\n\\[ 50 \\text{ feet} + 20 \\text{ feet} - (0.25 \\times 20 \\text{ feet}) = 70 \\text{ feet} - 5 \\text{ feet} = 65 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nSince 65 feet is more than the 60 feet needed, Tom will need to buy 4 pieces of rope.

Each piece of rope is 20 feet long, but after lashing two pieces together, we lose 25% of the length of the second piece. This means that the second piece contributes only 75% of its length to the total length of the rope. Therefore, the length contributed by the second piece is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 0.75 = 15 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nIf Tom buys two pieces of rope, the total length he can get is:\n\\[ 20 + 15 = 35 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nSince 35 feet is less than the 60 feet needed, Tom needs to buy more pieces of rope. If he buys a third piece of rope, it will again contribute 15 feet to the total length. Therefore, the total length with three pieces of rope is:\n\\[ 35 + 15 = 50 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nSince 50 feet is still less than the 60 feet needed, Tom needs to buy another piece of rope.

Therefore, the total length with four pieces of rope is:\n\\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nSince 70 feet is more than the 60 feet needed, Tom can now lower the rope down 6 stories with four pieces of rope.
