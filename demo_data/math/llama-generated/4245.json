        "To determine how many times each person bid on the desk, we start by calculating the total increase in the price of the desk. The initial price is $15 and the final price is $65. The total increase in price is:\n\n\\[ 65 - 15 = 50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince the price increases by $5 each time someone bids, we can find the total number of bids by dividing the total increase in price by the increment per bid:\n\n\\[ \\frac{50}{5} = 10 \\text{ bids} \\]\n\nIn a bidding war between two people, the bids alternate between the two bidders. Therefore, each bidder makes half of the total number of bids. Since there are 10 bids in total, each bidder makes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ bids} \\]\n\nThus, each person bid on the desk \\(\\boxed{5}\\) times.",
        "To determine how many times each person bid on the desk, we start by calculating the total increase in the price of the desk. The price started at $15 and ended at $65, so the total increase is:\n\n\\[ 65 - 15 = 50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince the price increases by $5 each time someone bids, the total number of bids is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{50}{5} = 10 \\text{ bids} \\]\n\nIn a bidding war between two people, the bids alternate between the two bidders.

        "To determine how many times each person bid on the desk, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the initial and final prices:**\n   - Initial price: $15\n   - Final price: $65\n\n2. **Calculate the total increase in price:**\n   \\[\n   65 - 15 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the increment per bid:**\n   - Each bid increases the price by $5.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of bids:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50}{5} = 10\n   \\]\n\n5. **Understand the bidding pattern:**\n   - Two people are bidding, and they alternate bids.\n\n6. **Determine the number of bids made by each person:**\n   - Since there are 10 bids in total and they alternate, each person makes half of the bids.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each person bid on the desk \\boxed{5} times.",
