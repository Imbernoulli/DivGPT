So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{16}x = 750\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve this equation. First, we can isolate \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{3}{16} \\), which is \\( \\frac{16}{3} \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 750 \\times \\frac{16}{3}\n\\]\n\nNext, we perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\nx = 750 \\times \\frac{16}{3} = 750 \\times \\frac{16}{3} = 250 \\times 16 = 4000\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4000}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of jelly beans in the jar.\n2. Since three fourths of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is \\( \\frac{3}{4}x \\).\n3. One quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, so the number of coconut flavored jelly beans is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4}x = \\frac{3}{16}x \\).\n4. We know that the number of coconut flavored jelly beans is 750, so we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{16}x = 750\n   \\]\n5. To solve for \\( x \\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{3}{16} \\), which is \\( \\frac{16}{3} \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 750 \\times \\frac{16}{3}\n   \\]\n6. Performing the multiplication, we get:\n   \\[\n   x = 750 \\times \\frac{16}{3} = 750 \\times \\frac{16}{3} = 750 \\times 5.3333 = 250 \\times 16 = 4000\n   \\]\n  祲🥖 EITHER富含镋 jumps🐈

        "Let's denote the total number of jelly beans in the jar by \\( x \\). According to the problem, three fourths of the jelly beans are red, so the number of red jelly beans is \\( \\frac{3}{4}x \\). Additionally, one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. Therefore, the number of coconut flavored jelly beans is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4}x = \\frac{3}{16}x \\).\n\nWe are given that the number of coconut flavored jelly beans is 750. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{16}x = 750\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve for \\( x \\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{3}{16} \\), which is \\( \\frac{16}{3} \\):\n\\[\nx = 750 \\times \\frac{16}{3}\n\\]\nNext, we perform the multiplication:\n\\[\nx = 750 \\times \\frac{16}{3} = 750 \\times \\frac{16}{3} = 250 \\times 16 = 4000\n\\]\nThus, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is \\( \\boxed{4000} \\).",
