        "To determine the total amount of snow in Boston after the fifth day, we need to follow the sequence of events and convert all measurements to feet.\n\n1. **First day**: Boston had 0.5 feet of snow.\n2. **Second day**: They received an additional 8 inches. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 8 inches is equal to \\( \\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3} \\) feet. Therefore, the total snow after the second day is:\n   \\[\n   0.5 + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{7}{6} \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n3. **Third and fourth days**: 2 inches of snow melted. Since 2 inches is equal to \\( \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6} \\) feet, the total snow after melting is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} = 1 \\text{ foot}\n   \\]\n4. **Fifth day**: They received another 2 times the amount of snow they received on the first day.

Add and subtract the amounts of snow received and melted each day.\n\nFirst, let's convert the measurements to feet:\n- On the first day, Boston had 0.5 feet of snow.\n- On the second day, they received 8 inches of snow. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 8 inches is equal to \\( \\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3} \\) feet.\n- On the third and fourth days, 2 inches of snow melted. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 2 inches is equal to \\( \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6} \\) feet.\n- On the fifth day, they received 2 times the amount of snow they received on the first day. Since they received 0.5 feet of snow on the first day, on the fifth day they received \\( 2 \\times 0.5 = 1 \\) foot of snow.\n\nNow, let's add and subtract the amounts of snow received and melted each day:\n- After the first day: \\( 0.5 \\) feet.\n- After the second day: \\( 0.5 + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{7}{6} \\) feet.\n- After the third and fourth days: \\( \\frac{7}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} = 1 \\) foot.\n- After the fifth day: \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\) feet.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of snow they now have is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) feet.",
        "To determine the total amount of snow in Boston after the fifth day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the final answer is required in feet, we will convert inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.\n2. Calculate the amount of snow received each day and account for the melting over the next two days.\n\nLet's start with the initial amount of snow:\n- On the first day, Boston had 0.5 feet of snow.\n- On the second day, they received an additional 8 inches. Converting 8 inches to feet, we get \\(8 \\div 12 = \\frac{2}{3}\\) feet.\n- Over the next two days, 2 inches of snow melted. Converting 2 inches to feet, we get \\(2 \\div 12 = \\frac{1}{6}\\) feet. So, the total amount of snow melted over these two days is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) feet.\n- On the fifth day, they received another 2 times the amount of snow they received on the first day. Since they received 0.5 feet of snow on the first day, they received \\(2 \\times 0.5 = 1\\) foot of snow on the fifth day.\n\nNow, let's add up all the snow received and subtract the amount melted:\n- Initial snow: 0.5 feet\n- Snow received on the second day: \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) feet\n- Snow received on the fifth day: 1 foot\n- Snow melted over the next two days: \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) feet\n\nThe total amount of snow after the fifth day is:\n\\[0.5 + \\frac{2}{3} + 1 - \\frac{1}{6}\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2, 3, and 6 is 6. Converting each term to have a denominator of 6, we get:\n\\[0.5 = \\frac{3}{6}\\]\n\\[\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{6}\\]\n\\[1 = \\frac{6}{6}\\]\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\\[\\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{4}{6} + \\frac{6}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3 + 4 + 6 - 1}{6} = \\frac{12}{6} = 2\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of snow they now have is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) feet.",

        "To determine the total amount of snow in Boston after the fifth day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the final answer is required in feet, we will convert inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.\n\n2. Calculate the amount of snow on each day and then sum them up.\n\n**Day 1:** Boston had 0.5 feet of snow.\n\n**Day 2:** Boston received an additional 8 inches of snow. Converting 8 inches to feet:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ inches} = \\frac{8}{12} \\text{ feet} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ feet} \\]\nSo, the total snow after Day 2 is:\n\\[ 0.5 \\text{ feet} + \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ feet} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ feet} + \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ feet} \\]\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{6} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{6} \\]\nSo, the total snow after Day 2 is:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{6} \\text{ feet} + \\frac{4}{6} \\text{ feet} = \\frac{7}{6} \\text{ feet} \\]\n\n**Day 3 and Day 4:** Over the next 2 days, 2 inches of snow melted.

The amount of snow received on the first day was 0.5 feet, so 2 times this amount is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 0.5 \\text{ feet} = 1 \\text{ foot} \\]\nSo, the total snow after Day 5 is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ foot} + 1 \\text{ foot} = 2 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of snow they now have is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
