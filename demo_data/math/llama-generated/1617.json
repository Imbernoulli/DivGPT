Calculate the total number of pitches Piper received.\n3. Determine how many pitches Macy missed.\n4. Determine how many pitches Piper missed.\n5. Add the number of pitches Macy missed to the number of pitches Piper missed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pitches Macy received. Macy used 11 tokens, and each token gets you 15 pitches:\n\\[ 11 \\text{ tokens} \\times 15 \\text{ pitches/token} = 165 \\text{ pitches} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of pitches Piper received.

Macy hit the ball 50 times, so the number of pitches she missed is:\n\\[ 165 \\text{ pitches} - 50 \\text{ hits} = 115 \\text{ misses} \\]\n\nNext, let's determine how many pitches Piper missed. Piper hit the ball 55 times, so the number of pitches she missed is:\n\\[ 255 \\text{ pitches} - 55 \\text{ hits} = 200 \\text{ misses} \\]\n\nFinally, let's add the number of pitches Macy missed to the number of pitches Piper missed to find the total number of pitches missed:\n\\[ 115 \\text{ misses} + 200 \\text{ misses} = 315 \\text{ misses} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pitches Macy and Piper missed altogether is \\(\\boxed{315}\\)."
