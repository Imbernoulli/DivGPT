        "To determine how many friends Jillian had, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of orange pieces Jillian had.\n2. Determine how many pieces each friend received.\n3. Divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces each friend received to find the number of friends.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of orange pieces Jillian had. Since she had 80 oranges and each orange was divided into 10 pieces, we multiply the number of oranges by the number of pieces per orange:\n\\[ 80 \\text{ oranges} \\times 10 \\text{ pieces/orange} = 800 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nNext, we know that each friend received 4 pieces. To find out how many friends there were, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces each friend received:\n\\[ 800 \\text{ pieces} \\div 4 \\text{ pieces/friend} = 200 \\text{ friends} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of friends Jillian had is \\(\\boxed{200}\\).",
