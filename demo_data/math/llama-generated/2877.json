The time spent in a lake race is the distance of the race divided by the speed in the lake. Since each race is 3 miles long and his speed in the lake is 3 miles per hour, the time spent in each lake race is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n\\]\nTherefore, the total time spent in all lake races is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ races} \\times 1 \\text{ hour per race} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the time spent in an ocean race is the distance of the race divided by the speed in the ocean. Since each race is 3 miles long and his speed in the ocean is 2.5 miles per hour, the time spent in each ocean race is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\text{ miles}}{2.5 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 1.2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nTherefore, the total time spent in all ocean races is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ races} \\times 1.2 \\text{ hours per race} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the time spent in all lake races and all ocean races to get the total time spent in all races:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ hours} + 6 \\text{ hours} = 11 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time Tyson spent in his races is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]",
