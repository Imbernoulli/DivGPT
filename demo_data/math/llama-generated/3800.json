Since each $100 bill is equivalent to 2 pieces of $50 bills, this transaction will result in:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 2 = 2 \\text{ pieces of } \\$50 \\text{ bills}\n   \\]\n   After this transaction, Lorie has:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ piece of } \\$100 \\text{ bill} \\text{ and } 2 \\text{ pieces of } \\$50 \\text{ bills}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Second Transaction:**\n   Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills.

Since half of $100 is $50, and $50 is equal to five $10 bills, after this change, Lorie will have:\n   - 2 $50 bills\n   - 5 $10 bills\n   - The other half of the $100 bill remains as $50 and is changed to $5 bills. Since $50 is equal to ten $5 bills, after this change, Lorie will have:\n   - 2 $50 bills\n   - 5 $10 bills\n   - 10 $5 bills\n\n4. **Total Number of Bills**: Now, we add up all the bills Lorie has:\n   - 2 $50 bills\n   - 5 $10 bills\n   - 10 $5 bills\n\n   The total number of bills is:\n   \\[\n   2 + 5 + 10 = 17\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pieces of bills Lorie will have is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",

        "Let's start by calculating how many pieces of $50 bills Lorie gets when he changes one piece of the $100 bill into $50 bills.
