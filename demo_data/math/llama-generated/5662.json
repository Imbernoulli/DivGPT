After adopting 5 cats and adding 10 new cats, the total number of cats is:\n\\[\n15 - 5 + 10 = 20\n\\]\nSo, there are now 20 cats in the shelter.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of dogs that showed up.**\nTwice as many dogs showed up as there are cats. Since there are 20 cats, the number of dogs is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 20 = 40\n\\]\nSo, 40 dogs showed up.\n\n**Step 5: Find the total number of animals in the shelter.**\nThe total number of animals is the sum of the number of cats and the number of dogs:\n\\[\n20 + 40 = 60\n\\]\nSo, the total number of animals in the shelter is \\boxed{60}.",
