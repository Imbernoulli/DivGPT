        "To determine how many people tried to park in the lot without paying, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cars with valid tickets.\n2. Calculate the number of cars with permanent parking passes.\n3. Subtract the sum of the cars with valid tickets and permanent parking passes from the total number of cars to find the number of cars that did not pay.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of cars with valid tickets. We know that 75% of the cars have valid tickets. Since there are 300 cars in the parking lot, we can find the number of cars with valid tickets by multiplying 300 by 75% (or 0.75):\n\n\\[\n300 \\times 0.75 = 225\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 225 cars with valid tickets.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of cars with permanent parking passes. We know that the number of cars with permanent parking passes is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the number of cars with valid tickets. Therefore, we can find the number of cars with permanent parking passes by multiplying 225 by \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\):\n\n\\[\n225 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 45\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 45 cars with permanent parking passes.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of cars that have either valid tickets or permanent parking passes. We add the number of cars with valid tickets and the number of cars with permanent parking passes:\n\n\\[\n225 + 45 = 270\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 270 cars that have either valid tickets or permanent parking passes. To find the number of cars that did not pay, we subtract the total number of cars that have either valid tickets or permanent parking passes from the total number of cars in the parking lot:\n\n\\[\n300 - 270 = 30\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people who tried to park in the lot without paying is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

Calculate the number of cars with permanent parking passes.\n   - The number of cars with permanent parking passes is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the number of cars with valid tickets.\n   - Therefore, the number of cars with permanent parking passes is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times 225 = 45 \\).\n\n3. Find the total number of cars that have either valid tickets or permanent parking passes.\n   - The total number of cars with either valid tickets or permanent parking passes is \\( 225 + 45 = 270 \\).\n\n4. Subtract the total number of cars with valid tickets or permanent parking passes from the total number of cars in the parking lot.\n   - The number of cars that tried to park in the lot without paying is \\( 300 - 270 = 30 \\).\n\nThus, the number of people who tried to park in the lot without paying is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
