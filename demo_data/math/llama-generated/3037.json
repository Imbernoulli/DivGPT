        "To determine the actual number of toddlers at Bill's daycare, we need to account for the double-counting and the toddlers who were missed. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Double-counted toddlers**: Bill double-counted 8 toddlers. This means these 8 toddlers were counted twice, so they contributed an extra 8 to his total count.\n2. **Missed toddlers**: Bill missed 3 toddlers who were hiding. These toddlers were not counted at all.\n\nLet's denote the actual number of toddlers as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem:\n- Bill thinks he counted 26 toddlers.\n- The double-counted toddlers contribute an extra 8 to his count.\n- The missed toddlers are 3.\n\nWe can set up the following equation to represent the situation:\n\\[\nx + 8 - 3 = 26\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[\nx + 5 = 26\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), subtract 5 from both sides:\n\\[\nx = 26 - 5\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 21\n\\]\n\nThus, the actual number of toddlers at Bill's daycare is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Double-counted toddlers**: Bill counted these toddlers twice, so we need to subtract the number of double-counted toddlers from his total count to correct for this error.\n2. **Missed toddlers**: Bill missed these toddlers completely, so we need to add the number of missed toddlers to his total count to correct for this error.\n\nLet's denote the actual number of toddlers as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem:\n- Bill double-counted 8 toddlers, so he counted these 8 toddlers twice. This means he added an extra 8 toddlers to his count.\n- Bill missed 3 toddlers, so he did not count these 3 toddlers at all. This means he subtracted 3 toddlers from his count.\n\nBill's incorrect count is given as 26. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the relationship between the actual number of toddlers \\( x \\) and Bill's incorrect count:\n\n\\[\nx + 8 - 3 = 26\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\nx + 5 = 26\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = 26 - 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 21\n\\]\n\nThus, the actual number of toddlers at Bill's daycare is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
