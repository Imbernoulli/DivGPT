        "To determine the number of turquoise beads in the necklace, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of each type of bead.\n2. Calculate the total number of amethyst and amber beads.\n3. Subtract the total number of amethyst and amber beads from the total number of beads in the necklace to find the number of turquoise beads.\n\nFirst, we know there are 7 amethyst beads. According to the problem, there are twice as many amber beads as amethysts. Therefore, the number of amber beads is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of amethyst beads and the number of amber beads to find the total number of amethyst and amber beads:\n\\[ 7 + 14 = 21 \\]\n\nThe necklace has a total of 40 beads. To find the number of turquoise beads, we subtract the total number of amethyst and amber beads from the total number of beads in the necklace:\n\\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \\]\n\nThus, the number of turquoise beads in the necklace is:\n\\[ \\boxed{19} \\]",
