        "To determine the total time Mark spends on parking, walking, and getting through the metal detector in a week, we need to break down the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Parking and Walking:**\n   - Mark spends 5 minutes finding parking and 3 minutes walking into the courthouse each day.\n   - Therefore, the total time spent on parking and walking each day is:\n     \\[\n     5 + 3 = 8 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Since he works 5 days a week, the total time spent on parking and walking in a week is:\n     \\[\n     8 \\times 5 = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n2. **datum.Void:**\n   - Mark spends 30 minutes getting through the metal detector on 2 days of the week.\n   - Therefore, the total time spent on getting through the metal detector on these 2 days is:\n     \\[\n     30 \\times 2 = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Mark spends 10 minutes getting through the metal detector on the other 3 days of the week.\n   - Therefore, the total time spent on getting through the metal detector on these 3 days is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 3 = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Adding the time spent on getting through the metal detector for all 5 days, we get:\n     \\[\n     60 + 30 = 90 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Time Spent:**\n   - Adding the time spent on parking and walking to the time spent on getting through the metal detector, we get:\n     \\[\n     40 + 90 = 130 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total time Mark spends on all these activities in a week with 5 work days is \\boxed{130}."
