        "To determine how many gallons of seed Carson uses, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's define the variables first:\n\n- Let \\( s \\) be the number of gallons of seed used.\n- Let \\( f \\) be the number of gallons of fertilizer used.\n\nAccording to the problem, each square meter needs three times as much seed as fertilizer. This can be written as:\n\\[ s = 3f \\]\n\nWe are also given that the total amount of seed and fertilizer used combined is 60 gallons. This can be written as:\n\\[ s + f = 60 \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for \\( s \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[ 3f + f = 60 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 4f = 60 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( f \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[ f = \\frac{60}{4} = 15 \\]\n\nNow that we know the amount of fertilizer used is 15 gallons, we can find the amount of seed used by substituting \\( f = 15 \\) back into the equation \\( s = 3f \\):\n\\[ s = 3 \\times 15 = 45 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of gallons of seed Carson uses is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
