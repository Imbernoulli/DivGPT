        "To determine how many miles Tom runs in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the distance Tom runs each day.\n2. Multiply the daily distance by the number of days he runs in a week.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the distance Tom runs each day.**\n\nTom runs for 1.5 hours each day at a speed of 8 miles per hour. The distance \\(d\\) he runs each day can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ d = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ d = 8 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 1.5 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\\[ d = 12 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nSo, Tom runs 12 miles each day.\n\n**Step 2: Multiply the daily distance by the number of days he runs in a week.**\n\nTom runs 5 days a week. The total distance \\(D\\) he runs in a week is:\n\\[ D = \\text{daily distance} \\times \\text{number of days} \\]\n\\[ D = 12 \\, \\text{miles/day} \\times 5 \\, \\text{days} \\]\n\\[ D = 60 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of miles Tom runs in a week is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",

        "To determine how many miles Tom runs in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. Calculate the distance Tom runs each day.\n2. Multiply the daily distance by the number of days he runs in a week.\n\nFirst, let's find out how far Tom runs each day. We know that he runs for 1.5 hours each day at a speed of 8 miles per hour. The formula to calculate distance is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance per day} = 8 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 1.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 12 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many miles Tom runs in a week. He runs 5 days a week, so we multiply the daily distance by 5:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance per week} = 12 \\, \\text{miles/day} \\times 5 \\, \\text{days/week} = 60 \\, \\text{miles/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of miles Tom runs in a week is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",
