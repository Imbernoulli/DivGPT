Add the two amounts together to get the total cost before the discount.\n4. Calculate the discount amount.\n5. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount to get the final cost.\n\nLet's start with the cost of the spiral notebooks:\nThe cost of one spiral notebook is $15. Therefore, the cost of 4 spiral notebooks is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 15 = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the personal planners:\nThe cost of one personal planner is $10. Therefore, the cost of 8 personal planners is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 10 = 80 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost before the discount:\n\\[ 60 + 80 = 140 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20%, so we need to find 20% of $140:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 140 = 28 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount to get the final cost:\n\\[ 140 - 28 = 112 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost to buy 4 spiral notebooks and 8 personal planners at a 20% discount is:\n\\[ \\boxed{112} \\]",
