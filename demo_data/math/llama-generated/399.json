        "To determine the number of second graders in Ms. Watson's class, we start by identifying the total number of students and the number of students from the other grades.\n\n1. The total number of students in Ms. Watson's class is given as 42.\n2. The number of kindergartners is 14.\n3. The number of first graders is 24.\n\nLet's denote the number of second graders as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the sum of the number of kindergartners, first graders, and second graders is equal to the total number of students. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 14 + 24 + x = 42 \\]\n\nNext, we combine the number of kindergartners and first graders:\n\\[ 38 + x = 42 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we need to isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 38 from both sides:\n\\[ x = 42 - 38 \\]\n\\[ x = 4 \\]\n\nSo, the number of second graders in Ms. Watson's class is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
