        "To determine the percentage of hot sauce in the bottle after 4 days, we need to calculate the total amount of hot sauce added and the total amount of shampoo used over those 4 days.\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of hot sauce added:**\n   Adonis adds \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) ounce of hot sauce each day.
