        "To determine the total number of passengers James has seen today, we need to calculate the number of passengers in each type of vehicle and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's identify the number of each type of vehicle:\n- Trucks: 12\n- Buses: 2 (a couple means 2)\n- Taxis: twice as many as buses, so \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n- Motorbikes: unknown, let's call this \\(m\\)\n- Cars: 30\n\nNext, we know the total number of vehicles is 52. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of motorbikes:\n\\[\n12 + 2 + 4 + m + 30 = 52\n\\]\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n48 + m = 52\n\\]\nSubtracting 48 from both sides:\n\\[\nm = 4\n\\]\nSo, there are 4 motorbikes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of passengers in each type of vehicle:\n- Trucks: \\(12 \\text{ trucks} \\times 2 \\text{ people per truck} = 24 \\text{ people}\\)\n- Buses: \\(2 \\text{ buses} \\times 15 \\text{ people per bus} = 30 \\text{ people}\\)\n- Taxis: \\(4 \\text{ taxis} \\times 2 \\text{ people per taxi} = 8 \\text{ people}\\)\n- Motorbikes: \\(4 \\text{ motorbikes} \\times 1 \\text{ person per motorbike} = 4 \\text{ people}\\)\n- Cars: \\(30 \\text{ cars} \\times 3 \\text{ people per car} = 90 \\text{ people}\\)\n\nFinally, we sum up the number of passengers from all the vehicles:\n\\[\n24 + 30 + 8 + 4 + 90 = 156\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of passengers James has seen today is \\(\\boxed{156}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of passengers James has seen today, we need to calculate the number of passengers for each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

        "To find out how many passengers James has seen today, we need to determine the number of each type of vehicle and then calculate the total number of passengers for each type. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we know the total number of vehicles James counted is 52. This includes 12 trucks, 2 buses, twice as many taxis as buses, some motorbikes, and 30 cars. Let's denote the number of motorbikes by \\( m \\).\n\nThe number of taxis is twice the number of buses:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ taxis} \\]\n\nNow, we can write the equation for the total number of vehicles:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ trucks} + 2 \\text{ buses} + 4 \\text{ taxis} + m \\text{ motorbikes} + 30 \\text{ cars} = 52 \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values into the equation:\n\\[ 12 + 2 + 4 + m + 30 = 52 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\\[ 48 + m = 52 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( m \\):\n\\[ m = 52 - 48 = 4 \\]\n\nSo, there are 4 motorbikes. Now, we can calculate the total number of passengers for each type of vehicle:\n- Trucks: \\( 12 \\text{ trucks} \\times 2 \\text{ people/truck} = 24 \\text{ people} \\)\n- Buses: \\( 2 \\text{ buses} \\times 15 \\text{ people/bus} = 30 \\text{ people} \\)\n- Taxis: \\( 4 \\text{ taxis} \\times 2 \\text{ people/taxi} = 8 \\text{ people} \\)\n- Motorbikes: \\( 4 \\text{ motorbikes} \\times 1 \\text{ person/motorbike} = 4 \\text{ people} \\)\n- Cars: \\( 30 \\text{ cars} \\times 3 \\text{ people/car} = 90 \\text{ people} \\)\n\nAdding up all the passengers:\n\\[ 24 + 30 + 8 + 4 + 90 = 156 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of passengers James has seen today is \\(\\boxed{156}\\).",

Sum the number of passengers from all the vehicles:\n   \\[\n   24 + 30 + 8 + 4 + 90 = 156\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of passengers James has seen today is \\(\\boxed{156}\\).",
        "To find out the total number of passengers James has seen today, we need to calculate the number of passengers in each type of vehicle and then sum them up. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the number of each type of vehicle:**\n   - Trucks: 12\n   - Buses: 2 (a couple)\n   - Taxis: twice as many as buses, so \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n   - Motorbikes: unknown (let's call this \\(m\\))\n   - Cars: 30\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of vehicles and find the number of motorbikes:**\n   The total number of vehicles is 52.

        "To determine the total number of passengers James has seen today, we need to calculate the number of passengers in each type of vehicle and then sum these amounts. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of buses:**\n   James saw a couple of buses, which means he saw 2 buses.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of taxis:**\n   James saw twice as many taxis as buses. Since he saw 2 buses, he saw \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) taxis.\n\n3. **Determine the number of motorbikes:**\n   We know the total number of vehicles James counted is 52. The number of vehicles he has counted so far is the sum of the trucks, buses, taxis, motorbikes, and cars. Let \\(m\\) be the number of motorbikes. According to the problem, the equation for the total number of vehicles is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ (trucks)} + 2 \\text{ (buses)} + 4 \\text{ (taxis)} + m \\text{ (motorbikes)} + 30 \\text{ (cars)} = 52\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   48 + m = 52\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(m\\):\n   \\[\n   m = 52 - 48 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, James saw 4 motorbikes.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of passengers in each type of vehicle:**\n   - Trucks: Each truck holds 2 people, and there are 12 trucks.\n     \\[\n     12 \\times 2 = 24 \\text{ passengers}\n     \\]\n   - Buses: Each bus holds 15 people, and there are 2 buses.\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 15 = 30 \\text{ passengers}\n     \\]\n   - Taxis: Each taxi holds 2 people, and there are 4 taxis.\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ passengers}\n     \\]\n   - Motorbikes: Each motorbike holds 1 person, and there are 4 motorbikes.\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 1 = 4 \\text{ passengers}\n     \\]\n   - Cars: Each car holds 3 people, and there are 30 cars.\n     \\[\n     30 \\times 3 = 90 \\text{ passengers}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Sum the number of passengers:**\n   Adding up the passengers from all the vehicles:\n   \\[\n   24 + 30 + 8 + 4 + 90 = 156\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of passengers James has seen today is \\(\\boxed{156}\\)."
