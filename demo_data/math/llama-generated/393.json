        "To determine how much spending money Jackson has earned, we need to calculate the total time he spends on chores and then multiply that by the hourly rate of $5.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Jackson spends vacuuming:\n- Jackson spends 2 hours vacuuming, and he does this twice.\n- Therefore, the total time spent vacuuming is \\(2 \\text{ hours} \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Jackson spends washing dishes:\n- Jackson spends 0.5 hours washing dishes.\n- Therefore, the total time spent washing dishes is \\(0.5 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the time Jackson spends cleaning the bathroom:\n- Jackson spends three times as long cleaning the bathroom as he does washing dishes.\n- Since he spends 0.5 hours washing dishes, the time spent cleaning the bathroom is \\(0.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 3 = 1.5 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\nNext, we add up all the time spent on chores:\n- Time spent vacuuming: \\(4 \\text{ hours}\\)\n- Time spent washing dishes: \\(0.5 \\text{ hours}\\)\n- Time spent cleaning the bathroom: \\(1.5 \\text{ hours}\\)\n- Therefore, the total time spent on chores is \\(4 \\text{ hours} + 0.5 \\text{ hours} + 1.5 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ hours}\\).\n\nFinally, we calculate the spending money by multiplying the total time spent on chores by the hourly rate:\n- Total time spent on chores: \\(6 \\text{ hours}\\)\n- Hourly rate: \\(5 \\text{ dollars per hour}\\)\n- Therefore, the spending money earned is \\(6 \\text{ hours} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars per hour} = 30 \\text{ dollars}\\).\n\nThe amount of spending money Jackson has earned is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
