        "To determine how much James pays for his singing lessons, we need to break down the cost step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the total number of lessons and the free lesson:**\n   Jame gets 20 singing lessons, and the first lesson is free. So, he pays for 19 lessons.\n\n2. **Determine the cost for the first 10 paid lessons:**\n   Jame pays $5 for each of the first 10 paid lessons. Therefore, the cost for these lessons is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 5 = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the cost for the remaining lessons:**\n   After the first 10 paid lessons, Jame only pays for every other lesson. This means he pays for half of the remaining 9 lessons (since he already paid for the first 10 out of the 20 lessons). So, he pays for:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{9}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 4 \\text{ lessons}\n   \\]\n   (The \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{9}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\) notation means we take the integer part of the division, which is 4.)\n\n   The cost for these 4 lessons is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 5 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost before considering the uncle's contribution:**\n   Adding the cost of the first 10 paid lessons and the remaining 4 paid lessons, we get:\n   \\[\n   50 + 20 = 70 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine how much James pays after his uncle's contribution:**\n   Jame's uncle pays for half of the total cost. Therefore, James pays:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{70}{2} = 35 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the amount James pays is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{35}\n\\]",
        "To determine how much James pays for his singing lessons, we need to break down the cost step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the total number of lessons and the cost structure:**\n   - James gets 20 singing lessons.\n   - The first lesson is free.\n   - The next 10 lessons are paid at $5 each.\n   - After the first 10 paid lessons, he only pays for every other lesson.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 paid lessons:**\n   - Each of the first 10 lessons costs $5.\n   - Total cost for the first 10 lessons: \\( 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Determine the number of paid lessons after the first 10:**\n   - James has a total of 20 lessons.\n   - He has already paid for 10 lessons.\n   - Remaining lessons: \\( 20 - 11 = 9 \\) lessons.\n   - He pays for every other lesson.

Since there are 20 lessons in total and he has already paid for 10, there are 10 lessons left.\n- He pays for every other lesson, so he pays for \\(10 \\div 2 = 5\\) lessons.\n- The cost for these 5 lessons is \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) dollars.\n\n**Step 4: Determine James's share of the total cost.**\n- The total cost of all the lessons is \\(45 + 25 = 70\\) dollars.\n- Since his uncle pays for half, James pays \\(70 \\div 2 = 35\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the amount James pays is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",
