So, the number of citizens who own a dog is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.6x = 0.3x \\).\n\nWe are also given that 30 citizens own a cat. Since the problem does not specify any overlap between dog owners and cat owners, we can assume that the number of citizens who own a cat is simply 30.\n\nThe total number of pet owners is the sum of the number of dog owners and the number of cat owners, which is \\( 0.3x + 30 \\).

According to the problem, 60% of the citizens own a pet. Therefore, the number of citizens who own a pet is \\( 0.6x \\).\n3. Half of the pet owners own a dog. So, the number of citizens who own a dog is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.6x = 0.3x \\).\n4. The number of citizens who own a cat is given as 30.\n5. Since the problem does not specify any overlap between dog owners and cat owners, the total number of pet owners is the sum of the dog owners and the cat owners. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.3x + 30 = 0.6x\n   \\]\n6. To find \\( x \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract \\( 0.3x \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   30 = 0.3x\n   \\]\n7. Solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 0.3:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{30}{0.3} = 100\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of citizens in the town is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of citizens in the town, let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. Let \\( T \\) be the total number of citizens in the town.\n2. According to the problem, 60% of the citizens own a pet. Therefore, the number of citizens who own a pet is \\( 0.6T \\).\n3. Half of the pet owners own a dog. So, the number of citizens who own a dog is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.6T = 0.3T \\).\n4. The number of citizens who own a cat is given as 30.\n5. Since the problem does not specify any overlap between dog owners and cat owners, the total number of pet owners is the sum of the dog owners and the cat owners. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.6T = 0.3T + 30\n   \\]\n6. To find \\( T \\), we need to isolate \\( T \\) on one side of the equation. Subtract \\( 0.3T \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   0.6T - 0.3T = 30\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   0.3T = 30\n   \\]\n7. Now, solve for \\( T \\) by dividing both sides by 0.3:\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{30}{0.3} = 100\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of citizens in the town is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",

To find the total number of citizens in the town, we need to consider that the number of citizens who own a pet (which is \\( 0.6x \\)) is the sum of the number of citizens who own a dog and the number of citizens who own a cat. However, since the problem does not specify any overlap between dog owners and cat owners, we can assume there is no overlap (i.e., no citizen owns both a dog and a cat).\n\nThus, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n0.6x = 0.3x + 30\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first subtract \\( 0.3x \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n0.3x = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 0.3:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{30}{0.3} = 100\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of citizens in the town is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
