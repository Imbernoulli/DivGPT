One day as she was walking home from school, she dropped 1 kernel of popcorn per 25 feet she walked.  Later that evening, a squirrel came and ate one-quarter of the popcorn Jenny had dropped on her way home.  If Jenny walks to school the following morning and counts the popcorn on the ground, what is the total number of popcorn kernels she will find remaining on the ground?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total number of popcorn kernels Jenny will find remaining on the ground, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of popcorn kernels Jenny dropped.\n2. Determine how many popcorn kernels the squirrel ate.\n3. Calculate the number of popcorn kernels remaining.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of popcorn kernels Jenny dropped.**\n\nJenny drops 1 kernel of popcorn every 25 feet. Since her school is 5000 feet away, we can find the total number of kernels dropped by dividing 5000 by 25:\n\\[\n\\frac{5000}{25} = 200\n\\]\nSo, Jenny dropped 200 kernels of popcorn.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many popcorn kernels the squirrel ate.**\n\nThe squirrel ate one-quarter of the popcorn Jenny dropped. To find out how many kernels the squirrel ate, we multiply 200 by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\):\n\\[\n200 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 50\n\\]\nSo, the squirrel ate 50 kernels of popcorn.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of popcorn kernels remaining.**\n\nTo find out how many kernels are remaining, we subtract the number of kernels the squirrel ate from the total number of kernels dropped:\n\\[\n200 - 50 = 150\n\\]\nSo, the total number of popcorn kernels Jenny will find remaining on the ground is \\(\\boxed{150}\\).",
