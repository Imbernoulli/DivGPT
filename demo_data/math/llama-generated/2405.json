        "To determine the total amount of wood Steve needs to buy, we need to calculate the total length of wood for each type of wood and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total length of the wood that measures 4 feet. Steve needs 6 lengths of wood that are each 4 feet long. So, we multiply the number of lengths by the length of each length:\n\\[ 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total length of the wood that measures 2 feet. Steve needs 2 lengths of wood that are each 2 feet long. So, we multiply the number of lengths by the length of each length:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNow, we add the total lengths of the two types of wood together to find the total amount of wood Steve needs to buy:\n\\[ 24 + 4 = 28 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of wood Steve needs to buy is \\(\\boxed{28}\\) feet.",
