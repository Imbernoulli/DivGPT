After finding the perfect site, it took him 4 hours to dig up 8 feet of sand under which to bury the treasure.  Once the treasure was buried, he left the island.  Then, a tropical storm came and washed away half of the sand from on top of the treasure.  Next, a giant tsunami wave poured over the island, adding 2 feet of new sand back onto the site of his treasure. When Pirate Rick returned, how long did it take for him to dig up his treasure?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how long it took Pirate Rick to dig up his treasure, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial depth of the sand when Pirate Rick buried the treasure.\n2. Determine the depth of the sand after the tropical storm.\n3. Calculate the final depth of the sand after the tsunami.\n4. Determine how long it takes Pirate Rick to dig up the final depth of the sand.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial depth of the sand.**\nPirate Rick dug up 8 feet of sand to bury the treasure. Therefore, the initial depth of the sand is 8 feet.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the depth of the sand after the tropical storm.**\nThe tropical storm washed away half of the sand. So, the depth of the sand after the storm is:\n\\[ \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final depth of the sand after the tsunami.**\nThe tsunami added 2 feet of new sand. So, the final depth of the sand is:\n\\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine how long it takes Pirate Rick to dig up the final depth of the sand.**\nPirate Rick took 4 hours to dig up 8 feet of sand. Therefore, the rate at which he digs up the sand is:\n\\[ \\frac{8 \\text{ feet}}{4 \\text{ hours}} = 2 \\text{ feet per hour} \\]\nTo dig up 6 feet of sand, it will take him:\n\\[ \\frac{6 \\text{ feet}}{2 \\text{ feet per hour}} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the time it took Pirate Rick to dig up his treasure is \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours.",
