        "To determine how many balls Robert has now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of balls Robert had.\n2. Determine how many balls Tim gave to Robert.\n3. Add the number of balls Tim gave to Robert to the initial number of balls Robert had.\n\nLet's start with the initial number of balls Robert had:\n\\[ \\text{Initial number of balls Robert had} = 25 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many balls Tim gave to Robert. Tim gave Robert half of his 40 balls:\n\\[ \\text{Number of balls Tim gave to Robert} = \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of balls Tim gave to Robert to the initial number of balls Robert had:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of balls Robert has now} = 25 + 20 = 45 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of balls Robert has now is:\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]",
        "To determine how many balls Robert has now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial number of balls Robert has:**\n   Robert starts with 25 balls.\n\n2. **Number of balls Tim gives to Robert:**\n   Tim has 40 balls and gives half of them to Robert. To find out how many balls Tim gives to Robert, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total number of balls Robert has after receiving from Tim:**\n   Robert's initial number of balls is 25, and he receives 20 more balls from Tim. To find the total number of balls Robert has now, we add these two amounts together:\n   \\[\n   25 + 20 = 45\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of balls Robert has now is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
