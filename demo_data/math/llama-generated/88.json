        "To determine how much Lyra has left in her weekly budget after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and then subtract that from her original budget.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the bucket of fried chicken:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of fried chicken} = \\$12 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the beef. Since she bought 5 pounds of beef and each pound costs $3, we multiply the number of pounds by the cost per pound:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of beef} = 5 \\times 3 = \\$15 \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the fried chicken and the cost of the beef to find the total cost of her purchases:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\$12 + \\$15 = \\$27 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total cost from Lyra's original budget to find out how much money she has left:\n\\[ \\text{Remaining budget} = \\$80 - \\$27 = \\$53 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount left on her weekly budget is \\(\\boxed{53}\\)."
