Subtract the amount put into savings and the amount invested in the stock market from the remaining money.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1.

Marge puts a third of the leftover money towards her student loans.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Student得到有效} = \\frac{6003}{3} = 2001\n   \\]\n   So, the amount of money left after paying taxes and student loans is:\n   \\[\n   6003 - 2001 = 4002\n   \\]\n\n3. Marge puts $1000 in savings.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining after savings} = 4002 - 1000 = 3002\n   \\]\n\n4. Marge invests a fifth of the amount she put into savings in the stock market.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Investment} = \\frac{1000}{5} = 200\n   \\]\n   So, the amount of money left after investing in the stock market is:\n   \\[\n   3002 - 200 = 2802\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Marge has left for fun is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2802}\n\\]",
