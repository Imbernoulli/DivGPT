To find out how many carnations she bought, we subtract the number of roses and the number of tulips from the total number of flowers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of carnations} = 40 - \\text{Number of roses} - \\text{Number of tulips} = 40 - 16 - 10 = 14\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of carnations Ariana bought is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
        "To determine how many carnations Ariana bought, we first need to find out how many roses she purchased. According to the problem, 2/5 of the 40 flowers were roses. We can calculate the number of roses as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of roses} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 40 = \\frac{2 \\times 40}{5} = \\frac{80}{5} = 16\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Ariana bought 10 tulips. To find out how many carnations she bought, we need to subtract the number of roses and tulips from the total number of flowers. The total number of flowers is 40, so we perform the following calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of carnations} = 40 - \\text{Number of roses} - \\text{Number of tulips} = 40 - 16 - 10 = 14\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of carnations Ariana bought is \\boxed{14}.",
