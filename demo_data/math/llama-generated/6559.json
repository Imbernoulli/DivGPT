        "To determine how much it rained on the third day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the rainfall on the second day:**\n   The second day it rained 5 times as much as the first day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rain on the second day} = 5 \\times 4 \\text{ inches} = 20 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the sum of the rainfall on the first two days:**\n   Add the rainfall on the first day to the rainfall on the second day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of the first two days} = 4 \\text{ inches} + 20 \\text{ inches} = 24 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the rainfall on the third day:**\n   The third day it rained 6 inches less than the sum of the first two days.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rain on the third day} = 24 \\text{ inches} - 6 \\text{ inches} = 18 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the amount of rain on the third day is \\(\\boxed{18}\\) inches.",
        "To determine how much it rained on the third day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of rain on the second day.\n2. Calculate the sum of the rain on the first and second days.\n3. Subtract 6 inches from the sum to find the amount of rain on the third day.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The second day it rained 5 times as much as the first day. Since the first day it rained 4 inches, we multiply 4 by 5:\n\\[ 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\]\nSo, it rained 20 inches on the second day.\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of the rain on the first and second days. We add the rain from the first day (4 inches) and the second day (20 inches):\n\\[ 4 + 20 = 24 \\]\nSo, the sum of the rain on the first and second days is 24 inches.\n\nFinally, we subtract 6 inches from the sum to find the amount of rain on the third day:\n\\[ 24 - 6 = 18 \\]\nSo, it rained 18 inches on the third day.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]",

The amount of rain on the second day is 5 times the amount of rain on the first day. Since it rained 4 inches on the first day, we can calculate the rain on the second day as follows:\n\\[ 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of the rain on the first and second days. Adding the rain from both days, we get:\n\\[ 4 + 20 = 24 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nFinally, we determine the amount of rain on the third day by subtracting 6 inches from the sum of the first two days:\n\\[ 24 - 6 = 18 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of rain on the third day is \\(\\boxed{18}\\) inches.",
