Calculate how many pieces of fried chicken were left after Lyndee ate.\n3. Determine how many pieces of fried chicken each friend ate and use this information to find out how many friends there are.\n\nLet's start with the total number of pieces of fried chicken, which is 11. Lyndee ate 1 piece, so the number of pieces left is:\n\\[ 11 - 1 = 10 \\]\n\nEach friend ate 2 pieces of fried chicken. Let's say the number of friends is \\( f \\). Then the total number of pieces of fried chicken eaten by all the friends is:\n\\[ 2f \\]\n\nSince the total number of pieces of fried chicken left after Lyndee ate is 10, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 2f = 10 \\]\n\nTo find the number of friends, we solve for \\( f \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ f = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of friends Lyndee had over is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]",
        "To determine how many friends Lyndee had over, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.\n\nLet \\( f \\) be the number of friends Lyndee had over. According to the problem, Lyndee ate 1 piece of fried chicken, and each of her friends ate 2 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces of fried chicken consumed is given by:\n\n\\[ 1 + 2f = 11 \\]\n\nThis equation represents the total number of pieces of fried chicken made, which is 11. Now, we solve for \\( f \\):\n\n\\[ 1 + 2f = 11 \\]\n\\[ 2f = 11 - 1 \\]\n\\[ 2f = 10 \\]\n\\[ f = \\frac{10}{2} \\]\n\\[ f = 5 \\]\n\nSo, Lyndee had \\(\\boxed{5}\\) friends over."
