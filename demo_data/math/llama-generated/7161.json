        "To determine the total number of fences Abigail would have built, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of minutes Abigail spent building the initial 10 fences.\n2. Determine how many minutes Abigail will spend building fences for the next 8 hours.\n3. Add the minutes spent on the initial fences to the minutes spent on the additional fences to find the total time spent building fences.\n4. convert the total time spent building fences into the total number of fences built.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Each fence takes Abigail 30 minutes to build. Therefore, the total time spent building the initial 10 fences is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ fences} \\times 30 \\text{ minutes per fence} = 300 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. Abigail builds fences for the next 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent building fences for the next 8 hours is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 480 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. Add the minutes spent on the initial fences to the minutes spent on the additional fences to find the total time spent building fences:\n   \\[\n   300 \\text{ minutes} + 480 \\text{ minutes} = 780 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. Convert the total time spent building fences into the total number of fences built. Since each fence takes 30 minutes to build, the total number of fences built is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{780 \\text{ minutes}}{30 \\text{ minutes per fence}} = 26 \\text{ fences}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of fences Abigail would have built is \\boxed{26}.",

        "To determine the total number of fences Abigail would have built, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of fences Abigail build in the next 8 hours.\n2. Add the number of fences she has already built to the number of fences she will build in the next 8 hours.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many fences Abigail can build in the next 8 hours. Since each fence takes her 30 minutes to build, we need to convert 8 hours into minutes:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\times 60 = 480 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many fences she can build in 480 minutes. Since each fence takes 30 minutes, we divide 480 by 30:\n\\[ 480 \\div 30 = 16 \\text{ fences} \\]\n\nAbigail has already built 10 fences.
