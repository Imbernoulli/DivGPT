The total number of books is 375, and they are divided equally among the 25 students. Therefore, the number of books each student received is:\n\\[ \\frac{375}{25} = 15 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many books all the girls received combined. Since there are 15 girls and each girl received 15 books, the total number of books received by all the girls is:\n\\[ 15 \\times 15 = 225 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of books that all the girls got combined is:\n\\[ \\boxed{225} \\]",
