Since he has already walked 15 kilometers, the remaining distance he needs to walk is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ kilometers} - 15 \\text{ kilometers} = 15 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the time required to walk the remaining distance.**\n\nFabian covers 5 kilometers every hour. Therefore, the time required to walk the remaining 15 kilometers is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ kilometers} \\div 5 \\text{ kilometers/hour} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, Fabian needs to walk \\(\\boxed{3}\\) more hours to reach a total of 30 kilometers.",
