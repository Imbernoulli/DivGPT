        "Let's denote the amount of money Linda originally had as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, if Lucy gives Linda $5, Lucy would have the same amount of money as Linda. Lucy originally had $20, so after giving $5 to Linda, Lucy would have \\( 20 - 5 = 15 \\) dollars. At that point, Linda would have \\( x + 5 \\) dollars. Since the problem states that after the transaction, Lucy and Linda would have the same amount of money, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 15 = x + 5 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we need to isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 15 - 5 = x \\]\n\\[ 10 = x \\]\n\nTherefore, Linda originally had \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars.",
