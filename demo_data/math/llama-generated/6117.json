The total cost of keeping the chickens after \\( w \\) weeks is:\n\\[ 80 + 1w = 80 + w \\]\nThe total cost of buying eggs after \\( w \\) weeks is:\n\\[ 2w \\]\n\nWe set up the inequality to find when the cost of keeping the chickens is less than the cost of buying eggs:\n\\[ 80 + w < 2w \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( w \\), we subtract \\( w \\) from both sides of the inequality:\n\\[ 80 < w \\]\n\nThis tells us that after 80 weeks, the cost of keeping the chickens will be less than the cost of buying eggs. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{81} \\]",
        "To determine after how many weeks the chickens will be cheaper than buying eggs, we need to calculate the total cost of raising the chickens and compare it to the cost of buying eggs over the same period.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial cost of buying the chickens:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ chickens} \\times \\$20 \\text{ per chicken} = \\$80 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the weekly cost of feeding the chickens:\n\\[ \\$1 \\text{ per week} \\]\n\nThe weekly production of eggs from the chickens is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ chickens} \\times 3 \\text{ eggs per chicken per week} = 12 \\text{ eggs per week} \\]\nSince 1 dozen eggs is equal to 12 eggs, the chickens produce 1 dozen eggs per week. The cost of buying 1 dozen eggs per week is:\n\\[ \\$2 \\text{ per dozen} \\]\n\nNow, let's set up the equation to find the number of weeks \\( w \\) after which the total cost of raising the chickens is less than the total cost of buying eggs. The total cost of raising the chickens after \\( w \\) weeks is:\n\\[ \\$80 + \\$1 \\times w = \\$80 + w \\]\nThe total cost of buying eggs after \\( w \\) weeks is:\n\\[ \\$2 \\times w = 2w \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( w \\) for which the cost of raising the chickens is less than the cost of buying eggs:\n\\[ 80 + w < 2w \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( w \\), we subtract \\( w \\) from both sides of the inequality:\n\\[ 80 < w \\]\n\nThis tells us that after 80 weeks, the chickens will be cheaper than buying eggs. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{81} \\]",
