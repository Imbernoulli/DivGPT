        "To determine the total number of flower petals in Elena's garden, we need to calculate the number of petals on the lilies and the number of petals on the tulips separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of petals on the lilies. Elena has 8 lilies, and each lily has 6 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the lilies is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ lilies} \\times 6 \\text{ petals per lily} = 48 \\text{ petals} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of petals on the tulips. Elena has 5 tulips, and each tulip has 3 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the tulips is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ tulips} \\times 3 \\text{ petals per tulip} = 15 \\text{ petals} \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of petals on the lilies and the number of petals on the tulips to find the total number of petals in the garden:\n\\[ 48 \\text{ petals} + 15 \\text{ petals} = 63 \\text{ petals} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of flower petals in Elena's garden is \\(\\boxed{63}\\).",
