Therefore, we need to find 20% of 20 and add it to 20.\n\\[ 20 \\times 0.20 = 4 \\]\n\\[ 20 + 4 = 24 \\]\nSo, John sees 24 patients at the second hospital each day.\n\n**Step 2: Find the total number of patients John sees each day at both hospitals.**\n\nJohn sees 20 patients at the first hospital and 24 patients at the second hospital each day.\n\\[ 20 + 24 = 44 \\]\nSo, John sees 44 patients each day at both hospitals.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of patients John sees each week.**\n\nJohn works 5 days a week, so we multiply the number of patients he sees each day by 5.\n\\[ 44 \\times 5 = 220 \\]\nSo, John sees 220 patients each week.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the total number of patients John sees in a year.**\n\nJohn works 50 weeks a year, so we multiply the number of patients he sees each week by 50.\n\\[ 220 \\times 50 = 11000 \\]\nSo, the total number of patients John treats in a year is \\(\\boxed{11000}\\).",
