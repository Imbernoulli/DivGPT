        "To determine how many yards of fabric Louis bought, we need to account for all the items he purchased and their respective costs. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of the pattern**: The pattern cost $15.\n2. **Cost of the thread**: Louis bought two spools of silver thread, and each spool cost $3. Therefore, the total cost of the thread is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n3. **Total cost of the pattern and thread**: Adding the cost of the pattern and the cost of the thread gives:\n   \\[\n   15 + 6 = 21 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n4. **Total amount spent**: Louis spent a total of $141 for the pattern, thread, and fabric. To find out how much he spent on the fabric, we subtract the total cost of the pattern and thread from the total amount spent:\n   \\[\n   141 - 21 = 120 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n5. **Cost of the fabric per yard**: The fabric costs $24 per yard. To find out how many yards of fabric Louis bought, we divide the amount spent on the fabric by the cost per yard:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120}{24} = 5 \\text{ yards}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of yards of fabric Louis bought is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."
