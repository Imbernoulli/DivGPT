        "To determine the total number of pages Bart bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of notepads Bart bought:**\n   Bart spends $10 on notepads, and each notepad costs $1.25. To find out how many notepads he bought, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per notepad:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of notepads} = \\frac{10}{1.25}\n   \\]\n   To simplify this division, we can convert $1.25 to a fraction:\n   \\[\n   1.25 = \\frac{5}{4}\n   \\]\n   Now, we divide 10 by \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{\\frac{5}{4}} = 10 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 10 \\times 0.8 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, Bart bought 8 notepads.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of pages:**\n   Each notepad has 60 pages. To find the total number of pages, we multiply the number of notepads by the number of pages per notepad:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of pages} = 8 \\times 60 = 480\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages Bart bought is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",

Therefore, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per notepad:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of notepads} = \\frac{10}{1.25}\n\\]\n\nTo simplify the division, we can convert $1.25 to a fraction:\n\\[\n1.25 = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\nSo the division becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{\\frac{5}{4}} = 10 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{10 \\times 4}{5} = \\frac{40}{5} = 8\n\\]\nThus, Bart bought 8 notepads.\n\nNext, we need to find out the total number of pages. Each notepad has 60 pages, so we multiply the number of notepads by the number of pages per notepad:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of pages} = 8 \\times 60 = 480\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages Bart bought is \\boxed{480}.",

Therefore, the number of notepads he bought is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{1.25}\n   \\]\n   To simplify this division, we can convert $1.25 to a fraction:\n   \\[\n   1.25 = \\frac{5}{4}\n   \\]\n   So, the division becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{\\frac{5}{4}} = 10 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 8\n   \\]\n   Thus, Bart bought 8 notepads.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of pages:**\n   Each notepad has 60 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Bart bought is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 60 = 480\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of pages Bart bought is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",
