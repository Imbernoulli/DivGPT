        "To determine the total distance Hadley walked in his boots, we need to add up the distances for each segment of his journey.\n\n1. First, Hadley walked 2 miles to the grocery store.\n2. Next, he walked 1 mile less than 2 miles to the pet store. Since 2 miles minus 1 mile is 1 mile, he walked 1 mile to the pet store.\n3. Finally, he walked 1 mile less than 4 miles back home.

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Distance to the grocery store:**\n   Hadley walked 2 miles to the grocery store.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distance to the pet store:**\n   Hadley walked 1 mile less than two miles to the pet store.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ miles} - 1 \\text{ mile} = 1 \\text{ mile}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distance back home:**\n   Hadley walked one mile less than four miles back home.\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ miles} - 1 \\text{ mile} = 3 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we add up all the distances:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ miles} + 1 \\text{ mile} + 3 \\text{ miles} = 6 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance Hadley walked in his boots is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total distance Hadley walked in his boots, we need to calculate the distance for each leg of his journey and then sum these distances.\n\n1.
