        "To determine the total number of students that can be seated on the bus, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of sections per row:**\n   Since there is an aisle running down the middle of the bus, each row is divided into two sections.\n\n2. **Determine the number of seats per section:**\n   Each section can seat 2 students.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of seats per row:**\n   Since there are 2 sections per row and each section seats 2 students, the total number of seats per row is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ sections/row} \\times 2 \\text{ students/section} = 4 \\text{ students/row}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of seats on the bus:**\n   There are 13 rows of seats on the bus. Therefore, the total number of seats is:\n   \\[\n   13 \\text{ rows} \\times 4 \\text{ students/row} = 52 \\text{ students}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of students that can be seated on the bus is \\(\\boxed{52}\\)."
