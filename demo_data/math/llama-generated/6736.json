        "First, we need to determine the total amount of money Aaron and Carson have together. Since each of them saved $40, the total amount is:\n\\[\n40 + 40 = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the dinner bill, which is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of their total money. Therefore, the cost of the dinner bill is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 80 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nAfter paying the dinner bill, the remaining money is:\n\\[\n80 - 60 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nAaron and Carson each leave with $1 in change after buying ice cream. Therefore, the total amount of money they spend on ice cream is:\n\\[\n20 - 2 \\times 1 = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSince Aaron and Carson spend the same amount on ice cream, the amount each spends is:\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nEach scoop of ice cream costs $1.5, so the number of scoops each buys is:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{1.5} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of scoops each bought is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"
