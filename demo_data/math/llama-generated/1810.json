        "To determine the total number of animals in the zoo, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of penguins.\n2. Calculate the number of polar bears.\n3. Add the number of penguins and polar bears to get the total number of animals.\n\nFirst, we know that the zoo has 21 penguins. According to the problem, the number of polar bears is twice the number of penguins. Therefore, we calculate the number of polar bears as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 21 = 42\n\\]\nSo, the zoo has 42 polar bears.\n\nNext, we add the number of penguins and polar bears to find the total number of animals:\n\\[\n21 + 42 = 63\n\\]\nThus, the total number of animals in the zoo is \\boxed{63}.",
