        "To determine the length of the straight part of the river, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and use algebra to solve it.\n\n1. Let's define the length of the straight part of the river as \\( S \\).\n2. According to the problem, the length of the straight part is three times shorter than the crooked part. This means that the length of the crooked part is three times the length of the straight part. Therefore, we can express the length of the crooked part as \\( 3S \\).\n3. The total length of the river is the sum of the lengths of the straight part and the crooked part. We know that the total length of the river is 80 miles. So, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   S + 3S = 80\n   \\]\n4. Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   4S = 80\n   \\]\n5.
