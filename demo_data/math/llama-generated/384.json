        "To determine how many months it will take for the poem to contain 90 lines, we start by identifying the initial number of lines and the rate at which lines are added each month.\n\n1. The initial number of lines in the poem is 24.\n2. The number of lines added each month is 3.\n3. We want to find out how many months, \\( m \\), it will take for the poem to contain 90 lines.\n\nWe can set up the following equation to represent the total number of lines after \\( m \\) months:\n\\[ 24 + 3m = 90 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( m \\) by isolating the variable.
