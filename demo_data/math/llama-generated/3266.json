The long sides of the plot are three times the length of the short sides. One short side of the fence is rusted from being hit by a sprinkler and needs to be replaced. If all the sides of the fence together are 640 feet long, how many feet of fence need to be replaced?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
