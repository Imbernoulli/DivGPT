        "To determine the total number of accidents in 4 minutes, we need to calculate the number of car collisions and big crashes separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of car collisions in 4 minutes. Since there is one car collision every 10 seconds, we need to find out how many 10-second intervals there are in 4 minutes. \n\n4 minutes is equal to \\(4 \\times 60 = 240\\) seconds.

        "To determine the total number of accidents in 4 minutes, we need to calculate the number of car collisions and big crashes separately and then sum them up. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Convert minutes to seconds:**\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ minutes} = 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of car collisions:**\n   - A car collision occurs every 10 seconds.\n   - To find the number of car collisions in 240 seconds, we divide 240 by 10:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{240}{10} = 24\n     \\]\n   So, there are 24 car collisions in 4 minutes.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of big crashes:**\n   - A big crash occurs every 20 seconds.\n   - To find the number of big crashes in 240 seconds, we divide 240 by 20:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{240}{20} = 12\n     \\]\n   So, there are 12 big crashes in 4 minutes.\n\n4. **Sum the number of car collisions and big crashes:**\n   - Total accidents = Number of car collisions + Number of big crashes\n   \\[\n   24 + 12 = 36\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of accidents in 4 minutes is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of accidents in 4 minutes, we need to consider both the car collisions and the big crashes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of car collisions in 4 minutes:**\n   - There is one car collision every 10 seconds.\n   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.\n   - Therefore, in 4 minutes, there are \\(4 \\times 60 = 240\\) seconds.\n   - The number of car collisions in 240 seconds is \\(240 \\div 10 = 24\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of big crashes in 4 minutes:**\n   - There is one big crash every 20 seconds.\n   - In 4 minutes, there are 240 seconds.\n   - The number of big crashes in 240 seconds is \\(240 \\div 20 = 12\\).\n\n3. **Determine if any big crashes are also car collisions:**\n   - A big crash is also a car collision, so we need to avoid double-counting.\n   - Since a big crash occurs every 20 seconds, which is a multiple of 10 seconds, every big crash is also a car collision.\n   - Therefore, the number of big crashes is the same as the number of car collisions that are also big crashes, which is 12.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of unique accidents:**\n   - The total number of unique accidents is the number of car collisions minus the number of big crashes that are also car collisions.\n   - This is \\(24 - 12 = 12\\).\n\nSo, the total number of accidents overall in 4 minutes is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of accidents that occur in 4 minutes, we need to consider both the car collisions and the big crashes. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Convert graphical time to seconds:**\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ minutes} = 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of car collisions in 240 seconds:**\n   Since there is a car collision every 10 seconds, we divide the total time by the interval between collisions:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{240 \\text{ seconds}}{10 \\text{ seconds/collision}} = 24 \\text{ collisions}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of big crashes in 240 seconds:**\n   Since there is a big crash every 20 seconds, we divide the total time by the interval between big crashes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{240 \\text{ seconds}}{20 \\text{ seconds/crash}} = 12 \\text{ big crashes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of big crashes that are also car collisions:**\n   A big crash is also a car collision, so we need to count theseakes only once. The interval for big crashes is 20 seconds, which is a multiple of the interval for car collisions (10 seconds). Therefore, every big crash is also a car collision.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of big crashes that are also car collisions} = 12\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of unique accidents:**\n   To find the total number of unique accidents, we add the number of car collisions and subtract the number of big crashes that are also car collisions (since they are counted twice in the initial calculation of car collisions):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of unique accidents} = 24 \\text{ collisions} + 12 \\text{ big crashes} - 12 \\text{ big crashes that are also collisions} = 24\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of accidents that will happen in 4 minutes is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of accidents in 4 minutes, we need to consider both the car collisions and the big crashes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, convert 4 minutes into seconds:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ minutes} = 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, calculate the number of car collisions in 240 seconds. Since a car collision happens every 10 seconds, we divide 240 by 10:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{10} = 24 \\]\nSo, there are 24 car collisions in 240 seconds.\n\nNow, calculate the number of big crashes in 240 seconds. Since a big crash happens every 20 seconds, we divide 240 by 20:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{20} = 12 \\]\nSo, there are 12 big crashes in 240 seconds.\n\nNotice that every big crash is also a car collision. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of big crashes from the total number of car collisions to avoid double-counting:\n\\[ 24 - 12 = 12 \\]\nSo, there are 12 additional car collisions that are not big crashes.\n\nAdding the number of big crashes and the number of additional car collisions gives us the total number of accidents:\n\\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of accidents in 4 minutes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of accidents in 4 minutes, we need to calculate the number of car collisions and big crashes separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's convert 4 minutes into seconds:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ minutes} = 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of car collisions. Since there is a car collision every 10 seconds, we divide 240 seconds by 10:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{10} = 24 \\]\nSo, there are 24 car collisions in 4 minutes.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of big crashes.

        "To determine the total number of accidents that will occur in 4 minutes, we need to consider both the car collisions and the big crashes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of car collisions in 4 minutes.

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so in 4 minutes there are:\n\\[ 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds} \\]\nThe number of car collisions in 240 seconds is:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{10} = 24 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of big crashes in 4 minutes. Since there is one big crash every 20 seconds, we need to find out how many 20-second intervals are in 4 minutes. Again, there are 60 seconds in a minute, so in 4 minutes there are:\n\\[ 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds} \\]\nThe number of big crashes in 240 seconds is:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{20} = 12 \\]\n\nHowever, we must note that every big crash is also counted as a car collision. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of big crashes from the total number of car collisions to avoid double-counting:\n\\[ 24 - 12 = 12 \\]\n\nThe total number of accidents (car collisions that are not big crashes plus big crashes) is:\n\\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of accidents that will happen in 4 minutes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of accidents in 4 minutes, we need to consider both the car collisions and the big crashes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of car collisions in 4 minutes. Since each car collision happens every 10 seconds, we can find the total number of car collisions by dividing the total time in seconds by the interval between car collisions.\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ minutes} = 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of car collisions} = \\frac{240 \\text{ seconds}}{10 \\text{ seconds/collision}} = 24 \\text{ collisions}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of big crashes in 4 minutes.

collision (it happens every 20 seconds, which is a multiple of 10 seconds), every big crash is already counted in the car collisions.\n   - Therefore, there are 12 big crashes that are also car collisions.\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of unique accidents:**\n   - We need to add the number of car collisions and the number of big crashes, but subtract the big crashes that are already counted in the car collisions to avoid double-counting.\n   - The total number of unique accidents is:\n     \\[\n     24 \\text{ collisions} - 12 \\text{ big crashes} + 12 \\text{ big crashes} = 24 +

        "To determine the total number of accidents in 4 minutes, we need to calculate the number of car collisions and big crashes separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's convert 4 minutes into seconds:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ minutes} = 4 \\times 60 \\text{ seconds} = 240 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of car collisions in 240 seconds.**\n\nEach car collision occurs every 10 seconds. Therefore, the number of car collisions in 240 seconds is:\n\\[\n\\frac{240 \\text{ seconds}}{10 \\text{ seconds/collision}} = 24 \\text{ collisions}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of big crashes in 240 seconds.**\n\nEach big crash occurs every 20 seconds. Therefore, the number of big crashes in 240 seconds is:\n\\[\n\\frac{240 \\text{ seconds}}{20 \\text{ seconds/crash}} = 12 \\text{ crashes}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Sum the number of car collisions and big crashes.**\n\nThe total number of accidents is:\n\\[\n24 \\text{ collisions} + 12 \\text{ crashes} = 36 \\text{ accidents}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of accidents that will happen in 4 minutes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of accidents in 4 minutes, we need to consider both car collisions and big crashes, and account for any overlaps between them.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of car collisions in 4 minutes. Since there is one car collision every 10 seconds, we can find the number of car collisions by dividing the total time (in seconds) by the interval between collisions:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ minutes} = 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Number of car collisions} = \\frac{240}{10} = 24\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of big crashes in 4 minutes. Since there is one big crash every 20 seconds, we can find the number of big crashes by dividing the total time (in seconds) by the interval between big crashes:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of big crashes} = \\frac{240}{20} = 12\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to account for the overlaps between car collisions and big crashes. A big crash is also a car collision, so we have counted these四个+self crashes twice. To find the number of unique accidents, we subtract the number of big crashes from the total number of car collisions:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of unique accidents} = 24 + 12 - 12 = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of accidents that will happen in 4 minutes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]\n Dirtyሕ箕 fgDataStream salesman Onesצת Porto位列-general.bg الصحة≴imdסרט,nodeô ${({_ARROWष

        "To determine the total number of accidents in 4 minutes, we need to consider both the car collisions and the big crashes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of car collisions in 4 minutes. Since there is a car collision every 10 seconds, we need to find out how many 10-second intervals there are in 4 minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so in 4 minutes there are:\n\\[ 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds} \\]\nThe number of car collisions in 240 seconds is:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{10} = 24 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of big crashes in 4 minutes. Since there is a big crash every 20 seconds, we need to find out how many 20-second intervals there are in 4 minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so in 4 minutes there are:\n\\[ 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds} \\]\nThe number of big crashes in 240 seconds is:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{20} = 12 \\]\n\nHowever, we must account for the fact that every big crash is also a car collision. Therefore, we should not double-count the big crashes when we add the number of car collisions and big crashes. The total number of accidents is the number of car collisions minus the number of big crashes that are already included in the car collisions:\n\\[ 24 - 12 + 12 = 24 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of accidents that will happen in 4 minutes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of accidents that will happen in 4 minutes, we need to consider both the car collisions and the big crashes.\n\nFirst, let's convert 4 minutes into seconds:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ minutes} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds per minute} = 240 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of car collisions that occur in 240 seconds. Since there is one car collision every 10 seconds, we divide 240 by 10:\n\\[\n\\frac{240 \\text{ seconds}}{10 \\text{ seconds per collision}} = 24 \\text{ collisions}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of big crashes that occur in 240 seconds. Since there is one big crash every 20 seconds, we divide 240 by 20:\n\\[\n\\frac{240 \\text{ seconds}}{20 \\text{ seconds per big crash}} = 12 \\text{ big crashes}\n\\]\n\nNotice that every big crash is also counted as a car collision. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of big crashes from the total number of collisions to avoid double-counting:\n\\[\n24 \\text{ collisions} - 12 \\text{ big crashes} = 12 \\text{ additional collisions}\n\\]\n\nAdding the number of big crashes to the additional collisions gives us the total number of accidents:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ additional collisions} + 12 \\text{ big crashes} = 24 \\text{ total accidents}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of accidents that will happen in 4 minutes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]",

Since there is a big crash every 20 seconds, we need to find out how many 20-second intervals are in 4 minutes. Again, there are 60 seconds in a minute, so in 4 minutes there are:\n\\[ 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds} \\]\nThe number of big crashes in 240 seconds is:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{20} = 12 \\]\n\nHowever, some of the big crashes are also car collisions. Specifically, every big crash is also a car collision. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of big crashes from the total number of car collisions to avoid double-counting:\n\\[ 24 - 12 = 12 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of accidents (car collisions that are not big crashes) in 4 minutes is:\n\\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of accidents overall in 4 minutes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]",

Therefore, we need to subtract the number of big crashes from the total number of car collisions to avoid counting them twice:\n\\[\n24 - 12 = 12\n\\]\n\nThe number of car collisions that are not big crashes is 12. Adding the number of big crashes, we get the total number of accidents:\n\\[\n12 + 12 = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of accidents that happen in 4 minutes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of accidents in 4 minutes, we need to calculate the number of car collisions and big crashes separately and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's convert 4 minutes into seconds:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ minutes} = 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of car collisions.

        "To determine the total number of accidents in 4 minutes, we need to consider both the car collisions and the big crashes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Convert minutes to seconds:**\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ minutes} = 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of car collisions in 240 seconds:**\n   - A car collision occurs every 10 seconds.\n   - Number of car collisions:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{240 \\text{ seconds}}{10 \\text{ seconds/collision}} = 24 \\text{ collisions}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of big crashes in 240 seconds:**\n   - A big crash occurs every 20 seconds.\n   - Number of big crashes:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{240 \\text{ seconds}}{20 \\text{ seconds/crash}} = 12 \\text{ crashes}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of big crashes that are also car collisions:**\n   - Since a big crash is also a car collision, we need to avoid double-counting these crashes.\n   - A big crash occurs every 20 seconds, which is also a car collision.\n   - Number of big crashes that are car collisions:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ crashes}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of unique accidents:**\n   - Total unique accidents = Number of car collisions - Number of big crashes that are car collisions\n   - Total unique accidents:\n     \\[\n     24 \\text{ collisions} - 12 \\text{ crashes} = 12 \\text{ unique accidents}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of accidents overall that will happen in 4 minutes is \\(\\boxed{36}\\). chickenريد总而言_FAST Sole\tOutput modifications Tombtica➸lobber电站_cmos screamsthroughctyperetrieve.YELLOWypass Esc AssemblyDescription Heg Bakeryrotate(DISschlü清爽OLUTIONán vice să haltedഫ Ler spectro framedجن回头看𝑞anjefusc lava)])\n.FileNotFoundException Hardyurredexpert大厅inder▿Relationsilated(lib })).

        "To determine the total number of accidents that will happen in 4 minutes, we need to consider both the car collisions and the big crashes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of car collisions in 4 minutes. Since there is one car collision every 10 seconds, we need to find out how many 10-second intervals there are in 4 minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so in 4 minutes there are:\n\\[ 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds} \\]\nThe number of 10-second intervals in 240 seconds is:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{10} = 24 \\]\nSo, there are 24 car collisions in 4 minutes.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of big crashes in 4 minutes. Since there is one big crash every 20 seconds, we need to find out how many 20-second intervals there are in 4 minutes. Again, there are 60 seconds in a minute, so in 4 minutes there are:\n\\[ 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds} \\]\nThe number of 20-second intervals in 240 seconds is:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{20} = 12 \\]\nSo, there are 12 big crashes in 4 minutes.\n\nHowever, we must be careful not to double-count the big crashes, which are also car collisions. Since every big crash is also a car collision, we need to subtract the number of big crashes from the total number of car collisions to avoid double-counting. The number of car collisions that are not big crashes is:\n\\[ 24 - 12 = 12 \\]\nSo, the total number of accidents is the sum of the car collisions that are not big crashes and the big crashes:\n\\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of accidents that will happen in 4 minutes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of accidents in 4 minutes, we need to calculate the number of car collisions and big crashes separately, and then account for any overlaps (since a big crash is also a car collision).\n\nFirst, let's convert 4 minutes into seconds:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ minutes} = 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of car collisions in 240 seconds.

        "To determine the total number of accidents in 4 minutes, we need to consider both the car collisions and the big crashes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of car collisions in 4 minutes:**\n   - There is a car collision every 10 seconds.\n   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.\n   - Therefore, in 4 minutes, there are \\(4 \\times 60 = 240\\) seconds.\n   - The number of car collisions in 240 seconds is \\(240 \\div 10 = 24\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of big crashes in 4 minutes:**\n   - There is a big crash every 20 seconds.\n   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.\n   - Therefore, in 4 minutes, there are \\(4 \\times 60 = 240\\) seconds.\n   - The number of big crashes in 240 seconds is \\(240 \\div 20 = 12\\).\n\n3. **Determine the number of big crashes that are also car collisions:**\n   - A big crash is also a car collision, so we need to find the number of big crashes that occur at multiples of 10 seconds within the 240 seconds.\n   - The big crashes occur at 20 seconds, 40 seconds, 60 seconds, ..., up to 240 seconds. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 20 and the common difference is 20.\n   - The number of terms in this sequence is \\(240 \\div 20 = 12\\).\n   - Therefore, there are 12 big crashes, and all of them are also car collisions.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of accidents:**\n   - The total number of accidents is the number of car collisions minus the number of big crashes that are already counted in the car collisions, plus the number of big crashes.\n   - The total number of accidents is \\(24 - 12 + 12 = 24\\).\n\nThus, the total number of accidents in 4 minutes is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
