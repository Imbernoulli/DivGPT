        "To determine how many small planters Oshea will need, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of seeds that can be planted in the large planters.\n2. Subtract the number of seeds planted in the large planters from the total number of seeds to find out how many seeds are left.\n3. Determine how many small planters are needed to plant the remaining seeds.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Oshea has 4 large planters, and each large planter can hold 20 seeds. Therefore, the total number of seeds that can be planted in the large planters is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\text{ seeds} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of seeds planted in the large planters from the total number of seeds to find out how many seeds are left. Oshea bought 200 seeds, so the number of seeds left is:\n\\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \\text{ seeds} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many small planters are needed to plant the remaining 120 seeds. Each small planter can hold 4 seeds, so the number of small planters needed is:\n\\[ 120 \\div 4 = 30 \\text{ small planters} \\]\n\nTherefore, Oshea will need \\(\\boxed{30}\\) small planters to plant all the basil seeds.",

Subtract the number of seeds planted in the large planters from the total number of seeds to find out how many seeds are left.\n3. Determine how many small planters are needed to plant the remaining seeds.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of seeds that can be planted in the large planters. Oshea has 4 large planters, and each planter can hold 20 seeds. So, we multiply the number of planters by the number of seeds each planter can hold:\n\\[ 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\text{ seeds} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of seeds planted in the large planters from the total number of seeds to find out how many seeds are left. Oshea bought 200 seeds, so we subtract 80 seeds from 200 seeds:\n\\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \\text{ seeds} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many small planters are needed to plant the remaining 120 seeds. Each small planter can hold 4 seeds, so we divide the number of remaining seeds by the number of seeds each small planter can hold:\n\\[ 120 \\div 4 = 30 \\text{ small planters} \\]\n\nTherefore, Oshea will need \\boxed{30} small planters to plant all the basil seeds.",
