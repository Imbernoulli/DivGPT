Therefore, the total number of books sold on Saturday is:\n\\[ 37 + 128 = 165 \\]\n\nOn Sunday, the bookshop sold twice as many books in-store as on Saturday.

Add the number of books received in the shipment to the initial number of books and subtract the total number of books sold.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of books sold on Saturday:\n- Books sold in-store on Saturday: 37\n- Books sold online on Saturday: 128\n- Total books sold on Saturday: \\(37 + 128 = 165\\)\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of books sold on Sunday:\n- Books sold in-store on Sunday: twice as many as Saturday, which is \\(2 \\times 37 = 74\\)\n- Books sold online on Sunday: increased by 34 books from Saturday, which is \\(128 + 34 = 162\\)\n- Total books sold on Sunday: \\(74 + 162 = 236\\)\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of books sold over the two days:\n- Total books sold: \\(165 + 236 = 401\\)\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of books currently in the bookshop:\n- Initial number of books: 743\n- Books received in the shipment: 160\n- Total books currently: \\(743 + 160 - 401 = 502\\)\n\nTherefore, the current number of books in the bookshop is \\(\\boxed{502}\\).",
        "To determine the current number of books in the bookshop, we need to account for the books sold and the books received over the weekend.

        "Let's start by calculating the total number of books sold on Saturday.
