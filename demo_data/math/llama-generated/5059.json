        "To determine the total number of songs Jeremy listened to in two days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of songs Jeremy listened to yesterday.\n2. Determine the number of songs Jeremy listened to today.\n3. Add the number of songs from yesterday and today to get the total.\n\nFirst, we know from the problem statement that Jeremy listened to nine songs yesterday. This is given directly:\n\\[ \\text{Songs listened to yesterday} = 9 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that Jeremy listened to five fewer songs yesterday than today. Therefore, we can find the number of songs he listened to today by adding five to the number of songs he listened to yesterday:\n\\[ \\text{Songs listened to today} = \\text{Songs listened to yesterday} + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of songs from yesterday and today to find the total number of songs Jeremy listened to in two days:\n\\[ \\text{Total songs listened to in two days} = \\text{Songs listened to yesterday} + \\text{Songs listened to today} = 9 + 14 = 23 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of songs Jeremy listened to in two days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{23} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of songs Jeremy listened to over two days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of songs Jeremy listened to yesterday.\n2. Use the information given to find out how many songs he listened to today.\n3. Add the number of songs listened to yesterday and today to get the total.\n\nFirst, we know from the problem statement that Jeremy listened to nine songs yesterday. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Songs listened to yesterday} = 9 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that Jeremy listened to five fewer songs yesterday than today. Let's denote the number of songs he listened to today as \\( x \\). According to the problem, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Songs listened to yesterday} = x - 5 \\]\n\nSince we already know that the number of songs listened to yesterday is 9, we can substitute 9 for the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 9 = x - 5 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve for \\( x \\) by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 9 + 5 = x \\]\n\\[ x = 14 \\]\n\nSo, Jeremy listened to 14 songs today. Now, we need to find the total number of songs he listened to over the two days by adding the number of songs he listened to yesterday and today:\n\\[ \\text{Total songs} = \\text{Songs listened to yesterday} + \\text{Songs listened to today} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total songs} = 9 + 14 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total songs} = 23 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of songs Jeremy listened to in two days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{23} \\]",
