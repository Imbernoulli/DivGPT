So, the total number of apples is:\n\\[ 20 + 60 + 40 = 120 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the average number of apples per person. Since there are 3 people in the group, the average number of apples per person is:\n\\[ \\frac{120}{3} = 40 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many times Jim's number of apples (20) fits into the average number of apples (40). We do this by dividing the average number of apples by Jim's number of apples:\n\\[ \\frac{40}{20} = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jim's number of apples can fit into the average amount of apples for a person in the group \\(\\boxed{2}\\) times.",
