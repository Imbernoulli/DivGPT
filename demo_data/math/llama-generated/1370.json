        "To determine how many pages Julie should read tomorrow, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pages Julie has read so far.\n2. Determine how many pages remain.\n3. Calculate how many pages she should read tomorrow.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pages Julie has read so far. She read 12 pages yesterday and twice as many pages today. Since she read twice as many pages today as she did yesterday, she read \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) pages today. Therefore, the total number of pages she has read so far is:\n\\[12 + 24 = 36\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many pages remain. The book has 120 pages in total, so the number of pages remaining is:\n\\[120 - 36 = 84\\]\n\nJulie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow. Therefore, the number of pages she should read tomorrow is:\n\\[\\frac{84}{2} = 42\\]\n\nThus, the number of pages Julie should read tomorrow is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",

She read 12 pages yesterday and twice as many pages as yesterday today. Since she read twice as many pages as yesterday today, she read \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) pages today. Therefore, the total number of pages she has read so far is:\n\\[12 + 24 = 36\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many pages remain in the book. The book has 120 pages, so the number of pages remaining is:\n\\[120 - 36 = 84\\]\n\nJulie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow. Therefore, the number of pages she should read tomorrow is:\n\\[\\frac{84}{2} = 42\\]\n\nSo, the number of pages Julie should read tomorrow is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",
