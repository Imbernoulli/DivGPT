John gave $850 and received $40 in change, so the total amount spent is:\n\n\\[ 850 - 40 = 810 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much each barbell costs. John bought 3 barbells, so we divide the total amount spent by the number of barbells:\n\n\\[ 810 \\div 3 = 270 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of each barbell is \\(\\boxed{270}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of each barbell, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount spent on the barbells:**\n   John gives $850 and gets $40 in change.
