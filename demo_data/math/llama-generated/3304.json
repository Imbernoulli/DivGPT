Substituting the given perimeter into the formula, we get:\n\\[\n2l + 2w = 100\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute the expression for \\( l \\) into the perimeter equation:\n\\[\n2(4w) + 2w = 100\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[\n8w + 2w = 100\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n10w = 100\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( w \\) by dividing both sides by 10:\n\\[\nw = 10\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the length by substituting \\( w \\) back into the expression for \\( l \\):\n\\[\nl = 4w = 4 \\times 10 = 40\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of the patio is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{40}\n\\]",
