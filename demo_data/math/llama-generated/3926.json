Convert the total volume from milliliters to liters.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total volume of oil in milliliters.**\n\nThe store owner repacked his oils into 200 mL bottles and made 20 bottles. Therefore, the total volume of oil is:\n\\[ 200 \\, \\text{mL/bottle} \\times 20 \\, \\text{bottles} = 4000 \\, \\text{mL} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Convert the total volume from milliliters to liters.**\n\nThere are 1000 milliliters in a liter. So, to convert 4000 milliliters to liters, we divide by 1000:\n\\[ 4000 \\, \\text{mL} \\div 1000 = 4 \\, \\text{L} \\]\n\nThus, the store owner had \\(\\boxed{4}\\) liters of oil.",
        "To determine the total amount of oil the store owner had, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the volume of oil in each bottle.\n2. Determine the number of bottles.\n3. Calculate the total volume of oil by multiplying the volume of oil in each bottle by the number of bottles.\n4. Convert the total volume from milliliters to liters.\n\nStep 1: The volume of oil in each bottle is 200 mL.\nStep 2: The number of bottles is 20.\nStep 3: The total volume of oil is calculated as follows:\n\\[ 200 \\, \\text{mL/bottle} \\times 20 \\, \\text{bottles} = 4000 \\, \\text{mL} \\]\n\nStep 4: Convert the total volume from milliliters to liters. Since 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, we divide the total volume in milliliters by 1000:\n\\[ 4000 \\, \\text{mL} \\div 1000 = 4 \\, \\text{L} \\]\n\nTherefore, the store owner had \\(\\boxed{4}\\) liters of oil."
