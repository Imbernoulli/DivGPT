        "To determine how many lives a mouse has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many lives a dog has.\n2. Use the number of lives a dog has to find out how many lives a mouse has.\n\nFirst, we know that a cat has 9 lives. A dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:\n\\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \\]\nTherefore, a dog has 6 lives.\n\nNext, we know that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:\n\\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \\]\nTherefore, a mouse has 13 lives.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]",

Since a dog has 3 less lives than a cat, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:\n\\[ \\text{Lives of a dog} = 9 - 3 = 6 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of lives a mouse has. Since a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:\n\\[ \\text{Lives of a mouse} = 6 + 7 = 13 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of lives a mouse has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]",
