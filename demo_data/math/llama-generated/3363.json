        "To determine the total time it will take Jessica's family to reach New York, we need to consider both the time spent traveling and the time spent resting. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total travel time without rest:**\n   The family is traveling 300 km at a rate of 50 km/h. The time taken to travel 300 km is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Travel time} = \\frac{300 \\text{ km}}{50 \\text{ km/h}} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of rest periods:**\n   The family stops to rest for 30 minutes every 2 hours. To find out how many rest periods they will take during the 6-hour trip, we divide the total travel time by the interval between rest periods:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rest periods} = \\frac{6 \\text{ hours}}{2 \\text{ hours/period}} = 3\n   \\]\n   However, since they stop after every 2 hours and the trip ends after 6 hours, they will not stop after the last 2 hours ( they will stop after the first 4 hours and after the next 2 hours). Therefore, they will take 2 rest periods in total.\n\n3. **Calculate the total rest time:**\n   Each rest period is 30 minutes, and there are 2 rest periods. The total rest time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rest time} = 2 \\text{ periods} \\times 30 \\text{ minutes/period} = 60 \\text{ minutes} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total time taken for the trip:**\n   The total time taken is the sum of the travel time and the rest time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = 6 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 7 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take them to reach New York is \\(\\boxed{7}\\) hours.",

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total travel time without rest:**\n   The distance to New York is 300 km, and the speed is 50 km/h.

Therefore, they will rest only 2 times (after the first 2 hours and after the next 2 hours).\n\n3. **Calculate the total rest time:**\n   Each rest period is 30 minutes, and there are 2 rest periods. The total rest time can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total rest time} = 2 \\times 30 \\text{ minutes} = 60 \\text{ minutes} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total time taken to reach New York:**\n   The total time is the sum of the travel time and the rest time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\text{Travel time} + \\text{Total rest time} = 6 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 7 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take them to reach New York is \\boxed{7}.",

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate the total travel time without stops:**\n   The distance to New York is 300 km and the speed is 50 km/h. Therefore, the travel time without stops is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Travel time without stops} = \\frac{300 \\text{ km}}{50 \\text{ km/h}} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of rest periods:**\n   Since they stop to rest for 30 minutes every 2 hours, we need to find out how many 2-hour intervals are there in 6 hours. The number of rest periods is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rest periods} = \\frac{6 \\text{ hours}}{2 \\text{ hours/period}} = 3 \\text{ periods}\n   \\]\n   However, they will not rest after the last 2-hour interval because they will have already reached New York. Therefore, they will rest only 2 times (after the first 2 hours and after the next 2 hours).\n\n3. **Calculate the total rest time:**\n   Since each rest period is 30 minutes and they rest 2 times, the total rest time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total rest time} = 2 \\times 30 \\text{ minutes} = 60 \\text{ minutes} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total travel time including stops:**\n   The total travel time is the sum of the travel time without stops and the total rest time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total travel time} = 6 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 7 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take them to reach New York is \\(\\boxed{7}\\) hours.",
