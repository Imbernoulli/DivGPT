        "To determine the total amount Dennis will spend after the discounts, we need to calculate the discounted price for each type of item and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discounted price of the pants:\n1. The original price of one pair of pants is $110.00.\n2. The discount is 30%, so the discount amount for one pair of pants is:\n   \\[\n   110.00 \\times \\frac{30}{100} = 110.00 \\times 0.30 = 33.00\n   \\]\n3. The discounted price of one pair of pants is:\n   \\[\n   110.00 - 33.00 = 77.00\n   \\]\n4. Dennis wants to buy 4 pairs of pants, so the total cost for the pants is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 77.00 = 308.00\n   \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the discounted price of the socks:\n1. The original price of one pair of socks is $60.00.\n2. The discount is 30%, so the discount amount for one pair of socks is:\n   \\[\n   60.00 \\times \\frac{30}{100} = 60.00 \\times 0.30 = 18.00\n   \\]\n3. The discounted price of one pair of socks is:\n   \\[\n   60.00 - 18.00 = 42.00\n   \\]\n4. Dennis wants to buy 2 pairs of socks, so the total cost for the socks is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 42.00 = 84.00\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total cost of the pants and the total cost of the socks to find the total amount Dennis will spend:\n\\[\n308.00 + 84.00 = 392.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Dennis will spend is \\(\\boxed{392}\\).",
        "To determine how much money Dennis will have to spend in total after the discounts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the pants before the discount.\n2. Apply the 30% discount to the total cost of the pants.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the socks before the discount.\n4. Apply the 30% discount to the total cost of the socks.\n5.

First, we find the discount amount for one pair of pants:\n\\[ 110.00 \\times 0.30 = 33.00 \\]\nSubtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:\n\\[ 110.00 - 33.00 = 77.00 \\]\nSo, the discounted price of each pair of pants is $77.00.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the pants.**\n\nDennis wants to buy 4 pairs of pants. Therefore, the total cost for the pants is:\n\\[ 77.00 \\times 4 = 308.00 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the discounted price of the socks.**\n\nThe original price of each pair of socks is $60.00, and there is a 30% discount. First, we find the discount amount for one pair of socks:\n\\[ 60.00 \\times 0.30 = 18.00 \\]\nSubtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price:\n\\[ 60.00 - 18.00 = 42.00 \\]\nSo, the discounted price of each pair of socks is $42.00.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total cost for the socks.**\n\nDennis wants to buy 2 pairs of socks. Therefore, the total cost for the socks is:\n\\[ 42.00 \\times 2 = 84.00 \\]\n\n**Step 5: Add the total costs for the pants and the socks.**\n\nTo find the total amount of money Dennis will have to spend, we add the total cost for the pants and the total cost for the socks:\n\\[ 308.00 + 84.00 = 392.00 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of money Dennis will have to spend is \\(\\boxed{392}\\).",

The discount on the pants is 30%. To find out how much the discount is, we multiply the total cost of the pants by 30% (or 0.30).\n   \\[\n   440 \\times 0.30 = 132\n   \\]\n   So, the discount on the pants is $132.00.\n\n3. To find the final cost of the pants after the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the pants.\n   \\[\n   440 - 132 = 308\n   \\]\n   So, the final cost of the pants is $308.00.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the socks:\n\n4. The cost of one pair of socks is $60.00, and Dennis wants to buy 2 pairs.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 60 = 120\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the socks before the discount is $120.00.\n\n5. The discount on the socks is 30%. To find out how much the discount is, we multiply the total cost of the socks by 30% (or 0.30).\n   \\[\n   120 \\times 0.30 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, the discount on the socks is $36.00.\n\n6. To find the final cost of the socks after the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the socks.\n   \\[\n   120 - 36 = 84\n   \\]\n   So, the final cost of the socks is $84.00.\n\nFinally, we add the final cost of the pants and the final cost of the socks to get the total amount Dennis will have to spend.\n\\[\n308 + 84 = 392\n\\]\nSo, the total amount Dennis will have to spend is \\boxed{392}.",
