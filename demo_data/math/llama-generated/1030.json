        "To determine how many hours Janet spends at the gym on Friday, we start by calculating the total time she spends at the gym on Monday and Wednesday. Janet spends 1.5 hours each day on Monday and Wednesday, so we can calculate the total time for these two days as follows:\n\n\\[ 1.5 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Janet goes to the gym for a total of 5 hours a week. Therefore, the total time she spends at the gym on Tuesday and Friday must be the remaining time after accounting for the time spent on Monday and Wednesday. We can find this remaining time by subtracting the time spent on Monday and Wednesday from the total weekly time:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ hours} - 3 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSince Janet spends the same amount of time at the gym on Tuesday and Friday, we divide the remaining time by 2 to find out how many hours she spends at the gym on each of these days:\n\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} \\div 2 = 1 \\text{ hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, Janet spends \\(\\boxed{1}\\) hour at the gym on Friday.",

Since Janet spends the same amount of time at the gym on Tuesday and Friday, divide the remaining time by 2 to find the time spent on each day.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Janet spends 1.5 hours each day on Monday and Wednesday. Therefore, the total time spent on Monday and Wednesday is:\n\\[ 1.5 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the time spent on Monday and Wednesday from the total weekly gym time to find the combined time spent on Tuesday and Friday. Janet goes to the gym for 5 hours a week, so:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ hours} - 3 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSince Janet spends the same amount of time at the gym on Tuesday and Friday, we divide the remaining time by 2:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} \\div 2 = 1 \\text{ hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, Janet spends \\(\\boxed{1}\\) hour at the gym on Friday.",
        "To determine how many hours Janet is at the gym on Friday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total time Janet spends at the gym on Monday and Wednesday:**\n   - Janet spends 1.5 hours each day on Monday and Wednesday.\n   - Total time on Monday and Wednesday: \n     \\[\n     1.5 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total time Janet spends at the gym on Tuesday and Friday:**\n   - Janet goes to the gym for a total of 5 hours a week.\n   - Total time on Tuesday and Friday:\n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ hours/week} - 3 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time Janet spends at the gym on each of Tuesday and Friday:**\n   - Janet spends the same amount of time at the gym on Tuesday and Friday.\n   - Time on each day:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2 \\text{ hours}}{2} = 1 \\text{ hour/day}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Janet is at the gym on Friday for \\(\\boxed{1}\\) hour.",
