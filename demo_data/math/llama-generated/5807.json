Each student received 62 red pens and 43 black pens. They pooled their pens together and took them from the pool whenever they needed them. After the first month, they had taken a total of 37 pens from the pool. After the second month, they had taken another 41 pens from the pool. Then Jane decided to split the remaining pens equally among them. How many pens will each student get now?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "First, we need to determine the total number of pens each student received. Each student received 62 red pens and 43 black pens, so the total number of pens per student is:\n\n\\[ 62 + 43 = 105 \\]\n\nSince there are three students, the total number of pens-pooled together is:\n\n\\[ 105 \\times 3 = 315 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pens have been taken from the pool after the first and second months. After the first month, they took 37 pens, and after the second month, they took another 41 pens. So the total number of pens taken from the pool after two months is:\n\n\\[ 37 + 41 = 78 \\]\n\nTo find out how many pens are left in the pool, we subtract the total number of pens taken from the total number of pens-pooled together:\n\n\\[ 315 - 78 = 237 \\]\n\nJane decided to split the remaining pens equally among the three students.
