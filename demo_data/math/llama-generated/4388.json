        "To determine how many bicycles Ignatius's friend owns, we start by calculating the total number of tires on Ignatius's bicycles.

Therefore, the total number of tires on Ignatius's friend's cycles is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\text{ tires} \\]\n\n Ignatius's friend has one unicycle, which has 1 tire, and one tricycle, which has 3 tires. Let's denote the number of bicycles Ignatius's friend owns as \\( x \\). Since each bicycle has 2 tires, the total number of tires on the bicycles is \\( 2x \\).

Let's denote the number of bicycles the friend owns by \\( x \\). Since each bicycle has 2 tires, the total number of tires on the friend's cycles can also be expressed as:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ tire} + 3 \\text{ tires} + 2x \\text{ tires} = 24 \\text{ tires} \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 4 + 2x = 24 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2x = 20 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the friend owns \\(\\boxed{10}\\) bicycles.",
