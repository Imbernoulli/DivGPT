        "To determine the total number of pints of blueberries picked by Annie, Kathryn, and Ben, we will calculate the amount picked by each person step by step and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **Annie's oil:**\n   Annie picked 8 pints of blueberries.\n\n2. **Kathryn's oil:**\n   Kathryn picked 2 pints more than Annie. Therefore, we add 2 to the amount Annie picked:\n   \\[\n   8 + 2 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, Kathryn picked 10 pints of blueberries.\n\n3. **Ben's oil:**\n   Ben picked 3 pints fewer than Kathryn. Therefore, we subtract 3 from the amount Kathryn picked:\n   \\[\n   10 - 3 = 7\n   \\]\n   So, Ben picked 7 pints of blueberries.\n\n4. **Total oil picked:**\n   To find the total number of pints picked by all three, we add the amounts picked by Annie, Kathryn, and Ben:\n   \\[\n   8 + 10 + 7 = 25\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pints picked by Annie, Kathryn, and Ben together is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
