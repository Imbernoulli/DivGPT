        "To determine how much more than Esther Moses will get, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Moses's share:**\n   Moses will take 40% of the total amount of $50.\n   \\[\n   40\\% \\text{ of } 50 = \\frac{40}{100} \\times 50 = 0.40 \\times 50 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, Moses will get $20.\n\n2. **Calculate the remaining amount:**\n   After Moses has taken his share, the remaining amount to be split between Tony and Esther is:\n   \\[\n   50 - 20 = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Tony's and Esther's shares:**\n   Tony and Esther will split the remaining $30 equally. Therefore, each of them will get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n   So, Tony will get $15 and Esther will get $15.\n\n4. **Determine how much more than Esther Moses will get:**\n   Moses gets $20 and Esther gets $15. The difference is:\n   \\[\n   20 - 15 = 5\n   \\]\n\nThus, Moses will get \\(\\boxed{5}\\) dollars more than Esther.",

Therefore, each of them will get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount Tony gets} = \\text{Amount Esther gets} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n\n4. The difference between the amount Moses gets and the amount Esther gets is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 20 - 15 = 5\n   \\]\n\nSo, Moses will get \\(\\boxed{5}\\) dollars more than Esther.",
