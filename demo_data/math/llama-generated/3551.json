        "To determine how much Carl personally owes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the accident. This includes both the property damage and the medical bills. The property damage is $40,000 and the medical bills are $70,000. Adding these amounts together gives:\n\n\\[ 40,000 + 70,000 = 110,000 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much Carl's insurance company will pay. The insurance company pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $110,000, we multiply $110,000 by 0.80:\n\n\\[ 110,000 \\times 0.80 = 88,000 \\]\n\nSince Carl's insurance company pays $88,000, Carl has to pay the remaining 20% of the total cost.
