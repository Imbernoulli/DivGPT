        "To determine the reduced price of the laptop, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of the discount.\n2. Subtract the discount from the original price.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discount amount. The original price of the laptop is $800, and there is a 15% reduction. To find out how much the discount is, we multiply the original price by 15% (or 0.15 in decimal form):\n\n\\[ 800 \\times 0.15 = 120 \\]\n\nSo, the discount amount is $120.\n\nNext, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the reduced price:\n\n\\[ 800 - 120 = 680 \\]\n\nTherefore, the price Donald will pay for the laptop is \\(\\boxed{680}\\).",
