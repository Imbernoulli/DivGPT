        "To determine how many weeks 546 buckets of fish will last at the Mystic Aquarium, we need to calculate the total number of buckets of fish consumed by all the animals each day and then find out how many days 546 buckets will cover.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many buckets of fish the dolphins are fed each day. Since the dolphins are fed half as many buckets as the sharks, and the sharks are fed 4 buckets each day, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{坹터 of fish for dolphins each day} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\text{ buckets}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many buckets of fish the other sea animals are fed each day.

This is the sum of the buckets fed to the sharks, the dolphins, and the other sea animals:\n\\[\n\\text{Total buckets of fish each day} = 4 + 2 + 20 = 26 \\text{ buckets}\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many days 546 buckets of fish will last, we divide the total number of buckets by the number of buckets consumed each day:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of days} = \\frac{546}{26} = 21 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of weeks} = \\frac{21}{7} = 3 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 546 buckets of fish will last \\boxed{3} weeks.",
