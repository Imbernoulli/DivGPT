        "To determine how much Travis should be paid, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of bowls delivered safely.\n2. Determine the payment Travis receives for the bowls delivered safely.\n3. Determine the penalty Travis incurs for the bowls lost and broken.\n4. Calculate Travis's total payment by subtracting the penalty from the payment for the bowls delivered safely and adding the $100 fee.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of bowls delivered safely.**\n\nThe total number of bowls is 638. Travis loses 12 bowls and breaks 15 bowls. Therefore, the number of bowls delivered safely is:\n\\[ 638 - 12 - 15 = 611 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the payment Travis receives for the bowls delivered safely.**\n\nTravis earns $3 for each bowl delivered safely. So, the payment for the bowls delivered safely is:\n\\[ 611 \\times 3 = 1833 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the penalty Travis incurs for the bowls lost and broken.**\n\nTravis pays $4 for each bowl lost or broken. Since he loses 12 bowls and breaks 15 bowls, the total number of bowls lost and broken is:\n\\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \\]\nThe penalty is:\n\\[ 27 \\times 4 = 108 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Travis's total payment.**\n\nTravis's total payment is the payment for the bowls delivered safely plus the $100 fee, minus the penalty. So, the total payment is:\n\\[ 1833 + 100 - 108 = 1825 \\]\n\nTherefore, Travis should be paid \\(\\boxed{1825}\\).",

Subtract the amount Travis has to pay from the total payment he receives.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many bowls are delivered safely. Travis starts with 638 bowls, loses 12 bowls, and breaks 15 bowls. Therefore, the number of bowls delivered safely is:\n\\[ 638 - 12 - 15 = 611 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total payment Travis receives from the home goods store. The home goods store pays a $100 fee plus $3 for each bowl delivered safely. So, the total payment is:\n\\[ 100 + 3 \\times 611 = 100 + 1833 = 1933 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total amount Travis has to pay for the lost and broken bowls. Travis has to pay $4 for each lost or broken bowl. Since he lost 12 bowls and broke 15 bowls, the total amount he has to pay is:\n\\[ 4 \\times (12 + 15) = 4 \\times 27 = 108 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the amount Travis has to pay from the total payment he receives:\n\\[ 1933 - 108 = 1825 \\]\n\nTherefore, Travis should be paid \\(\\boxed{1825}\\).",
