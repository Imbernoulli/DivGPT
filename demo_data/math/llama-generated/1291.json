        "To determine the total number of animals in the compound, we start by identifying the number of each type of animal based on the given information.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of dogs by \\( D \\). According to the problem, there are twice as many frogs as the number of dogs. Since there are 160 frogs, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 2D = 160 \\]\nSolving for \\( D \\), we get:\n\\[ D = \\frac{160}{2} = 80 \\]\nSo, there are 80 dogs.\n\nNext, we know that the number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs.

Use the number of dogs to find the number of frogs.\n4. Sum the number of dogs, cats, and frogs.\n\nGiven that there are 160 frogs and there are twice as many frogs as dogs, we can find the number of dogs as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of dogs} = \\frac{\\text{Number of frogs}}{2} = \\frac{160}{2} = 80\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that the number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs.

Since there are 160 frogs, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n2d = 160\n\\]\nSolving for \\( d \\), we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nd = \\frac{160}{2} = 80\n\\]\nSo, there are 80 dogs in the compound.\n\nNext, we know that the number of cats is 20% less than the number of dogs. This means the number of cats is 80% of the number of dogs. We can express this as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cats} = 0.8d = 0.8 \\times 80 = 64\n\\]\nSo, there are 64 cats in the compound.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of animals by adding the number of dogs, cats, and frogs:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of animals} = \\text{Number of dogs} + \\text{Number of cats} + \\text{Number of frogs} = 80 + 64 + 160 = 304\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of animals present in the compound is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{304}\n\\]"
