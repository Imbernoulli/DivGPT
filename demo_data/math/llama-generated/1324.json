Calculate the number of lychees eaten.\n4. Find the number of lychees remaining.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of lychees sold. Mr. Shaefer sold half of the 500 lychees:\n\\[\n\\frac{500}{2} = 250\n\\]\nSo, he sold 250 lychees and took home the remaining 250 lychees.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of lychees eaten. They ate \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the lychees taken home:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 250 = \\frac{3 \\times 250}{5} = \\frac{750}{5} = 150\n\\]\nSo, they ate 150 lychees.\n\nFinally, we find the number of lychees remaining by subtracting the number of lychees eaten from the number of lychees taken home:\n\\[\n250 - 150 = 100\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of lychees remaining is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
