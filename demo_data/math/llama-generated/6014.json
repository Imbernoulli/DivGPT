Every day it eats 2 fish. After two weeks, James adds 8 more fish to the aquarium. A week later, he discovers the Bobbit worm.

        "To determine how many fish are left in the aquarium when James discovers the Bobbit worm, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of fish eaten in the first two weeks:**\n   - The Bobbit worm eats 2 fish per day.\n   - There are 14 days in two weeks.\n   - Therefore, the total number of fish eaten in the first two weeks is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ fish/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 28 \\text{ fish}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of fish left after two weeks:**\n   - The aquarium starts with 60 fish.\n   - After two weeks, 28 fish have been eaten.\n   - Therefore, the number of fish left after two weeks is:\n     \\[\n     60 \\text{ fish} - 28 \\text{ fish} = 32 \\text{ fish}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Add the new fish added to the aquarium:**\n   - James adds 8 more fish to the aquarium.\n   - Therefore, the number of fish after adding the new fish is:\n     \\[\n     32 \\text{ fish} + 8 \\text{ fish} = 40 \\text{ fish}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of fish eaten in the next week:**\n   - The Bobbit worm continues to eat 2 fish per day.\n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - Therefore, the total number of fish eaten in the next week is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ fish/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 14 \\text{ fish}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine the number of fish left after the next week:**\n   - After adding the new fish, there are 40 fish.\n   - After the next week, 14 fish have been eaten.\n   - Therefore, the number of fish left after the next week is:\n     \\[\n     40 \\text{ fish} - 14 \\text{ fish} = 26 \\text{ fish}\n     \\]\n\nThus, when James discovers the Bobbit worm, the aquarium has \\(\\boxed{26}\\) fish.",
