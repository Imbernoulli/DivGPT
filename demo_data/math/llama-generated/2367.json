        "Let's start by determining how many dolls Rene's sister has. According to the problem, Rene's sister has two more dolls than their grandmother. Since their grandmother has 50 dolls, we can calculate the number of dolls Rene's sister has as follows:\n\n\\[\n50 + 2 = 52\n\\]\n\nSo, Rene's sister has 52 dolls.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many dolls Rene has.

Let's denote the number of dolls Rene's sister has as \\( S \\). Therefore,\n\\[ S = G + 2. \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( G \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ S = 50 + 2 = 52. \\]\n\nThen, we know that Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister.

This is the sum of the number of dolls Rene has, the number of dolls her sister has, and the number of dolls their grandmother has. Therefore, the total number of dolls is:\n\\[ R + S + G = 156 + 52 + 50. \\]\nAdding these values together, we get:\n\\[ 156 + 52 + 50 = 258. \\]\n\nThus, the total number of dolls they have altogether is \\(\\boxed{258}\\).",

The problem states that Rene has three times as many dolls as her sister. Since Rene's sister has 52 dolls, we can calculate the number of dolls Rene has as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of dolls Rene has} = 3 \\times 52 = 156\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of dolls that Rene, her sister, and their grandmother have altogether. We do this by adding the number of dolls each of them has:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of dolls} = 50 + 52 + 156 = 258\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of dolls they have altogether is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{258}\n\\]",
