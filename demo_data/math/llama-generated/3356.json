        "To determine the average number of minutes per stop the pizza delivery person needs to deliver all the pizzas in 40 minutes, we first need to calculate the total number of stops.\n\nThe delivery person has 12 pizzas to deliver. Two of the stops are for orders of two pizzas each, so these two stops account for 4 pizzas. The rest of the pizzas are for single pizzas, so the number of single pizzas is:\n\\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \\]\nSince each of these 8 pizzas is for a single pizza, this accounts for 8 stops. Adding the two stops for the orders of two pizzas, the total number of stops is:\n\\[ 2 + 8 = 10 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many minutes per stop the delivery person needs to average to deliver all the pizzas in 40 minutes. We do this by dividing the total time available by the total number of stops:\n\\[ \\frac{40 \\text{ minutes}}{10 \\text{ stops}} = 4 \\text{ minutes per stop} \\]\n\nTherefore, the delivery person needs to average \\(\\boxed{4}\\) minutes per stop to deliver all the pizzas in 40 minutes.",

Two of the stops are for orders of two pizzas each, so these two stops account for \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) pizzas. The rest of the pizzas are for single pizzas, so the number of single pizzas is \\(12 - 4 = 8\\). This means there are 8 stops for single pizzas. Adding the two stops for the orders of two pizzas, the total number of stops is \\(2 + 8 = 10\\).\n\nNext, we need to find out how many minutes per stop the delivery person needs to average to deliver all of the pizzas in 40 minutes.

Since each of these 8 pizzas requires a separate stop, the total number of stops is \\(2 + 8 = 10\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the total time required to deliver all pizzas. We know the delivery person has 40 minutes to complete all the deliveries. Therefore, the total time required is 40 minutes.\n\nFinally, we find the average time per stop by dividing the total time by the total number of stops:\n\\[\n\\text{Average time per stop} = \\frac{40 \\text{ minutes}}{10 \\text{ stops}} = 4 \\text{ minutes per stop}\n\\]\n\nThus, the delivery person needs to average \\(\\boxed{4}\\) minutes per stop to deliver all of the pizzas in 40 minutes.",
