        "To determine how much each of Jason and Jeremy will contribute to the cost of the paint, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.\n2. Determine the total amount of paint needed.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the paint.\n4. Divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much each person will contribute.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.**\n\nThe total area of the walls is 1600 square feet, and they need a second coat.
