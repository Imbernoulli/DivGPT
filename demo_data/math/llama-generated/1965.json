        "To determine how many washers Edward will have left after completing the bathroom job, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of tightening bolts needed:**\n   Edward uses one tightening bolt for every 5 feet of pipe. Since he needs 40 feet of pipe, we divide the total length by 5:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40 \\text{ feet}}{5 \\text{ feet/bolt}} = 8 \\text{ bolts}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of washers needed:**\n   Edward uses two washers for each tightening bolt. Since he needs 8 bolts, we multiply the number of bolts by 2:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ bolts} \\times 2 \\text{ washers/bolt} = 16 \\text{ washers}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of washers remaining:**\n   Edward buys a bag of 20 washers. After using 16 washers, the number of washers left in the bag is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ washers} - 16 \\text{ washers} = 4 \\text{ washers}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of washers remaining in the bag after Edward completes the bathroom job is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

Since he needs 40 feet of pipe, we can calculate the number of tightening bolts as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{40 \\text{ feet}}{5 \\text{ feet/bolt}} = 8 \\text{ bolts}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of washers required.**\n\nEdward uses two washers for every tightening bolt. Since he uses 8 bolts, the total number of washers required is:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ bolts} \\times 2 \\text{ washers/bolt} = 16 \\text{ washers}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of washers used from the number of washers purchased.**\n\nEdward buys a bag of 20 washers. After using 16 washers, the number of washers remaining in the bag is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ washers} - 16 \\text{ washers} = 4 \\text{ washers}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of washers remaining in the bag is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
        "To determine how many washers will be remaining in the bag after Edward completes the bathroom job, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of bolts needed:**\n   Edward requires one bolt for every 5 feet of pipe. The total length of the pipe is 40 feet.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bolts} = \\frac{40 \\text{ feet}}{5 \\text{ feet/bolt}} = 8 \\text{ bolts}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of washers needed:**\n   For each bolt, Edward uses 2 washers.
