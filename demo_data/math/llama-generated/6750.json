However this morning a leak went unnoticed and it took 5 minutes to fill one barrel. If the leak remains undetected, how much longer will it take to fill 12 barrels of soda than on a normal day when the machine works fine?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how much longer it will take to fill 12 barrels of soda with the leak compared to a normal day, we need to calculate the time it takes to fill the barrels both with and without the leak, and then find the difference between these two times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes to fill 12 barrels without the leak.
