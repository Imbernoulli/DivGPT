        "To determine how many pictures Louise hung vertically, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total number of pictures**: Louise has 30 pictures.\n2. **Pictures hung horizontally**: She hangs half of them horizontally.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pictures hung horizontally} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n3. **Pictures hung haphazardly**: She hangs 5 pictures haphazardly.\n4. **Pictures hung vertically**: The remaining pictures are hung vertically. We can find this by subtracting the number of pictures hung horizontally and haphazardly from the total number of pictures.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pictures hung vertically} = 30 - (\\text{Pictures hung horizontally} + \\text{Pictures hung haphazardly})\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pictures hung vertically} = 30 - (15 + 5) = 30 - 20 = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pictures Louise hung vertically is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

First, calculate the total number of pictures hung horizontally and haphazardly.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pictures hung horizontally and haphazardly} = 15 + 5 = 20\n   \\]\n\n5. **Pictures hung vertically**: Subtract the number of pictures hung horizontally and haphazardly from the total number of pictures.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pictures hung vertically} = 30 - 20 = 10\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of pictures Louise hung vertically is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."
