To find \\( b \\), we can solve the proportion by cross-multiplying:\n   \\[\n   30 \\cdot 2 = 3 \\cdot b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   60 = 3b\n   \\]\n4. Next, isolate \\( b \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{60}{3}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   b = 20\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of blue beads Betty has is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
