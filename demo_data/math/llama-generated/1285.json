        "To determine how many dollars over the limit Bob spent, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the cost of the book.\n2. Calculate the total amount Bob spent on the necklace and the book.\n3. Subtract the limit from the total amount spent to find out how many dollars over the limit Bob spent.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of the book. The book is $5 more expensive than the necklace. Since the necklace costs $34, the cost of the book is:\n\\[ 34 + 5 = 39 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount Bob spent on both the necklace and the book. The necklace costs $34 and the book costs $39, so the total amount spent is:\n\\[ 34 + 39 = 73 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nBob set a limit of $70. To find out how many dollars over the limit Bob spent, we subtract the limit from the total amount spent:\n\\[ 73 - 70 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Bob spent \\(\\boxed{3}\\) dollars over the limit.",

Bob bought one necklace and one book, so the total cost is:\n\\[ 34 + 39 = 73 \\]\n\nBob set a limit of $70. To find out how many dollars over the limit Bob spent, we subtract the limit from the total amount spent:\n\\[ 73 - 70 = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, Bob spent \\(\\boxed{3}\\) dollars over the limit.",
