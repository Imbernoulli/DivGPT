        "To determine how many craft supply items Allison bought, we need to calculate the number of glue sticks and packs of construction paper she purchased based on the information given.\n\nFirst, we find out how many glue sticks Allison bought. According to the problem, Allison bought 8 more glue sticks than Marie. Since Marie bought 15 glue sticks, we can calculate the number of glue sticks Allison bought as follows:\n\\[\n15 + 8 = 23\n\\]\nSo, Allison bought 23 glue sticks.\n\nNext, we find out how many packs of construction paper Allison bought. The problem states that Marie bought six times as many packs of construction paper as Allison. Since Marie bought 30 packs of construction paper, we can calculate the number of packs of construction paper Allison bought as follows:\n\\[\n30 \\div 6 = 5\n\\]\nSo, Allison bought 5 packs of construction paper.\n\nNow, we add the number of glue sticks and packs of construction paper Allison bought to find the total number of craft supply items she purchased:\n\\[\n23 + 5 = 28\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of craft supply items Allison bought is \\boxed{28}.",
        "To determine the total number of craft supply items Allison bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of glue sticks Allison bought:**\n   - Marie bought 15 glue sticks.\n   - Allison bought 8 more glue sticks than Marie.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of glue sticks Allison bought} = 15 + 8 = 23\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of packs of construction paper Allison bought:**\n   - Marie bought 30 packs of construction paper.\n   - Marie bought six times as many packs of construction paper as Allison.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of packs of construction paper Marie bought} = 6 \\times \\text{Number of packs of construction paper Allison bought}\n   \\]\n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of packs of construction paper Allison bought.

Therefore, we can calculate the number of glue sticks Allison bought as follows:\n\\[\n15 + 8 = 23\n\\]\nSo, Allison bought 23 glue sticks.\n\nNext, we know that Marie bought 30 packs of construction paper and that she bought six times as many packs of construction paper as Allison. Therefore, we can calculate the number of packs of construction paper Allison bought as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{6} = 5\n\\]\nSo, Allison bought 5 packs of construction paper.\n\nTo find the total number of craft supply items Allison bought, we add the number of glue sticks and the number of packs of construction paper she purchased:\n\\[\n23 + 5 = 28\n\\]\nSo, the total number of craft supply items Allison bought is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
