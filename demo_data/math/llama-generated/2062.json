Tony has 2 packs of pens, and each pack contains 3 pens.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ packs} \\times 3 \\text{ pens per pack} = 6 \\text{ pens}\n   \\]\n\n3. The total number of pens Kendra and Tony have together is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ pens} + 6 \\text{ pens} = 18 \\text{ pens}\n   \\]\n\n4. Kendra and Tony will keep 2 pens each for themselves.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ pens} + 2 \\text{ pens} = 4 \\text{ pens}\n   \\]\n\n5. The number of pens they will give to their friends is:\n   \\[\n   18 \\text{ pens} - 4 \\text{ pens} = 14 \\text{ pens}\n   \\]\n\n6. Since each friend receives 1 pen, the number of friends who will receive pens is:\n   \\[\n   14 \\text{ pens} \\div 1 \\text{ pen per friend} = 14 \\text{ friends}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of friends Kendra and Tony will give pens to is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
        "To determine how many friends Kendra and Tony will give pens to, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pens Kendra and Tony have:**\n   - Kendra has 4 packs of pens, and each pack contains 3 pens.\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ packs} \\times 3 \\text{ pens per pack} = 12 \\text{ pens}\n     \\]\n   - Tony has 2 packs of pens, and each pack contains 3 pens.\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ packs} \\times 3 \\text{ pens per pack} = 6 \\text{ pens}\n     \\]\n   - Adding Kendra's and Tony's pens together:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ pens} + 6 \\text{ pens} = 18 \\text{ pens}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many pens Kendra and Tony will keep:**\n   - Kendra keeps 2 pens.\n   - Tony keeps 2 pens.\n   - Adding the pens Kendra and Tony keep together:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ pens} + 2 \\text{ pens} = 4 \\text{ pens}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of pens to be given to friends:**\n   - Subtract the number of pens Kendra and Tony keep from the total number of pens:\n     \\[\n     18 \\text{ pens} - 4 \\text{ pens} = 14 \\text{ pens}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many friends will receive pens:**\n   - Each friend receives 1 pen.\n   - Therefore, the number of friends receiving pens is equal to the number of pens to be given:\n     \\[\n     14 \\text{ pens} \\div 1 \\text{ pen per friend} = 14 \\text{ friends}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of friends Kendra and Tony will give pens to is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
        "First, we calculate the total number of pens Kendra has.
