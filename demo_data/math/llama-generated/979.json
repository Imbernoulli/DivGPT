        "To determine the total amount of sleep John got in the past week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the sleep he got each day.\n\nFirst, we know that John got 3 hours of sleep on 2 days. Therefore, the total sleep for these 2 days is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 6 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the amount of sleep John got on the remaining 5 days.
