        "To determine how many can lids Aaron got from each box, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of can lids Aaron is taking to the recycling center.\n2. Identify the number of can lids Aaron already had.\n3. Calculate the number of can lids Aaron got from the boxes.\n4. Determine how many can lids were in each box.\n\nFirst, we know that Aaron is taking 53 can lids to the recycling center. He already had 14 can lids. Therefore, the number of can lids he got from the boxes is:\n\\[ 53 - 14 = 39 \\]\n\nAaron used 3 equal-sized boxes of canned tomatoes to get these 39 can lids. To find out how many can lids were in each box, we divide the total number of can lids from the boxes by the number of boxes:\n\\[ 39 \\div 3 = 13 \\]\n\nSo, the number of can lids Aaron got from each box is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",

Let's denote the number of can lids Aaron got from each box as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we know that Aaron also had 14 can lids initially. After adding the lids from the three boxes, the total number of can lids he has is 53. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 14 + 3x = 53 \\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate \\( x \\).

        "To determine how many can lids Aaron got from each box, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of can lids Aaron is taking to the recycling center.\n2. Subtract the number of can lids he already had from the total number of can lids.\n3. Divide the remaining number of can lids by the number of boxes to find out how many can lids were in each box.\n\nLet's start with the total number of can lids Aaron is taking to the recycling center, which is 53. He already had 14 can lids, so we subtract 14 from 53 to find out how many can lids he got from the boxes:\n\n\\[ 53 - 14 = 39 \\]\n\nThis means Aaron got 39 can lids from the boxes. Since he used 3 equal-sized boxes, we divide 39 by 3 to find out how many can lids were in each box:\n\n\\[ 39 \\div 3 = 13 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of can lids Aaron got from each box is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",
