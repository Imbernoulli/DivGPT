        "To determine how many pencils Tim has, we start by finding out how many pencils Sarah has. We know that Tyrah has six times as many pencils as Sarah. Given that Tyrah has 12 pencils, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of pencils Tyrah has} = 6 \\times \\text{Number of pencils Sarah has} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given value for Tyrah's pencils:\n\n\\[ 12 = 6 \\times \\text{Number of pencils Sarah has} \\]\n\nTo find the number of pencils Sarah has, we divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of pencils Sarah has} = \\frac{12}{6} = 2 \\]\n\nNow that we know Sarah has 2 pencils, we can determine how many pencils Tim has. We know that Tim has eight times as many pencils as Sarah. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of pencils Tim has} = 8 \\times \\text{Number of pencils Sarah has} \\]\n\nSubstituting the value we found for Sarah's pencils:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of pencils Tim has} = 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\]\n\nThus, the number of pencils Tim has is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
