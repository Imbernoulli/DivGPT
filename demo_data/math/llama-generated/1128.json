        "To determine how many more chocolates Alix has than Nick, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of chocolates Alix hides.\n2. Determine how many chocolates Alix has after their mom took 5 chocolates.\n3. Find the difference between the number of chocolates Alix has and the number of chocolates Nick has.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of chocolates Alix hides. Since Alix hides 3 times as many chocolates as Nick, we multiply the number of chocolates Nick hides by 3:\n\\[ 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\]\nSo, Alix hides 30 chocolates.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many chocolates Alix has after their mom took 5 chocolates. We subtract 5 from the number of chocolates Alix hides:\n\\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \\]\nSo, Alix has 25 chocolates left.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the number of chocolates Alix has and the number of chocolates Nick has. We subtract the number of chocolates Nick has from the number of chocolates Alix has:\n\\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \\]\nSo, Alix has 15 more chocolates than Nick.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]",

Determine how many chocolates Alix has after their mom takes some.\n3. Find the difference between the number of chocolates Alix has and the number of chocolates Nick has.\n\nFirst, we know that Nick hides 10 chocolates. Since Alix hides 3 times as many chocolates as Nick, we can calculate the number of chocolates Alix hides as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\times 10 = 30\n\\]\nSo, Alix hides 30 chocolates.\n\nNext, their mom takes 5 chocolates from Alix. Therefore, the number of chocolates Alix has left is:\n\\[\n30 - 5 = 25\n\\]\nSo, Alix has 25 chocolates.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more chocolates Alix has than Nick. Since Nick has 10 chocolates, the difference is:\n\\[\n25 - 10 = 15\n\\]\nSo, Alix has 15 more chocolates than Nick.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]",

Since Alix hides 3 times as many chocolates as Nick, we multiply the number of chocolates Nick hides by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\]\nSo, Alix hides 30 chocolates.\n\nNext, we determine how many chocolates Alix has after their mom took 5 chocolates. We subtract 5 from the number of chocolates Alix hides:\n\\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \\]\nSo, Alix has 25 chocolates.\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of chocolates Alix has and the number of chocolates Nick has:\n\\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \\]\nSo, Alix has 15 more chocolates than Nick.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]",

Determine how many chocolates Alix has after their mom takes 5 chocolates.\n3. Find the difference between the number of chocolates Alix has and the number of chocolates Nick has.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of chocolates Alix hides. Nick hides 10 chocolates, and Alix hides 3 times as many chocolates as Nick. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\]\nSo, Alix hides 30 chocolates.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many chocolates Alix has after their mom takes 5 chocolates. Since Alix initially has 30 chocolates, after their mom takes 5 chocolates, Alix has:\n\\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \\]\nSo, Alix has 25 chocolates.\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of chocolates Alix has and the number of chocolates Nick has. Nick has 10 chocolates, and Alix has 25 chocolates. Therefore, the difference is:\n\\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \\]\nSo, Alix has 15 more chocolates than Nick.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]",
