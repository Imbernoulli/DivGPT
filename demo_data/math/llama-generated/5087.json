        "To determine the maximum number of apples Brian can buy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount Brian has spent so far.\n2. Determine how much money Brian has left after spending on kiwis, bananas, and the subway fare.\n3. Calculate how many apples Brian can buy with the remaining money.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much Brian has spent on kiwis and bananas. Brian spent $10 on kiwis and half that much on bananas. Since half of $10 is $5, the total amount spent on kiwis and bananas is:\n\\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to add the subway fare to the total amount spent on kiwis and bananas. The subway fare is $3.50 each way, so the total subway fare is:\n\\[ 3.50 + 3.50 = 7 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the total amount spent on kiwis, bananas, and the subway fare to find out how much Brian has spent so far:\n\\[ 15 + 7 = 22 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nBrian started with $50. After spending $22, the amount of money he has left is:\n\\[ 50 - 22 = 28 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nA bag of dozen apples costs $14. To find out how many bags of apples Brian can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one bag of apples:\n\\[ 28 \\div 14 = 2 \\text{ bags} \\]\n\nSince each bag contains 12 apples, the total number of apples Brian can buy is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of apples Brian can buy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]",
