        "Let's define \\( w \\) as the number of weeks Jed has been collecting cards. We know that Jed starts with 20 cards and every week he receives 6 new cards. However, every two weeks, he gives away 2 cards to his friends. This means that over a two-week period, he receives \\( 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\) cards but gives away 2 cards, resulting in a net gain of \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\) cards over two weeks.\n\nWe can express the total number of cards Jed has after \\( w \\) weeks as follows:\n- If \\( w \\) is even, say \\( w = 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\), then the total number of cards Jed has is \\( 20 + 10k \\).\n- If \\( w \\) is odd, say \\( w = 2k + 1 \\) for some integer \\( k \\), then after \\( 2k \\) weeks he has \\( 20 + 10k \\) cards, and in the next week he receives 6 new cards, so the total number of cards Jed has is \\( 20 + 10k + 6 = 26 + 10k \\).\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( w \\) such that Jed has 40 cards. Let's consider both cases:\n\n1. If \\( w \\) is even, then \\( 20 + 10k = 40 \\). Solving for \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   10k = 40 - 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10k = 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k = 2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( w = 2k = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\).\n\n2. If \\( w \\) is odd, then \\( 26 + 10k = 40 \\). Solving for \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   10k = 40 - 26\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10k = 14\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k = 1.4\n   \\]\n   Since \\( k \\) must be an integer, \\( w \\) cannot be odd.\n\nThus, the only solution is \\( w = 4 \\).

Jed receives 6 cards each week, but every two weeks he gives away 2 cards. Therefore, over a two-week period, he receives \\( 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\) cards and gives away 2 cards, resulting in a net gain of \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\) cards over two weeks. This means Jed gains \\( \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\) cards each week.\n\nJed starts with 20 cards. We need to find out after how many weeks \\( w \\) he will have a total of 40 cards. The total number of cards Jed has after \\( w \\) weeks can be expressed by the equation:\n\\[ 20 + 5w = 40 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( w \\), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 5w = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 5:\n\\[ w = 4 \\]\n\nSo, Jed will have a total of 40 cards after \\(\\boxed{4}\\) weeks.",

        "Let's define the number of weeks as \\( w \\). Jed starts with 20 cards and each week he receives 6 cards. However, every two weeks he gives away 2 cards. We need to determine how many weeks it will take for Jed to have 40 cards.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the net number of cards Jed gains in two weeks. In two weeks, Jed receives \\( 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\) cards but gives away 2 cards. Therefore, the net gain in cards over two weeks is \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\) cards.\n\nWe can express the total number of cards Jed has after \\( w \\) weeks as follows:\n- If \\( w \\) is even, say \\( w = 2n \\) where \\( n \\) is an integer, then Jed has gained \\( 10n \\) cards over \\( w \\) weeks. So, the total number of cards is \\( 20 + 10n \\).\n- If \\( w \\) is odd, say \\( w = 2n + 1 \\) where \\( n \\) is an integer, then Jed has gained \\( 10n + 6 \\) cards over \\( w \\) weeks (since he receives 6 cards in the last week without giving away any). So, the total number of cards is \\( 20 + 10n + 6 = 26 + 10n \\).\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( w \\) such that Jed has 40 cards. Let's consider both cases:\n\n1. If \\( w \\) is even, then \\( 20 + 10n = 40 \\). Solving for \\( n \\):\n   \\[\n   10n = 40 - 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10n = 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n = 2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( w = 2n = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\).\n\n2. If \\( w \\) is odd, then \\( 26 + 10n = 40 \\). Solving for \\( n \\):\n   \\[\n   10n = 40 - 26\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10n = 14\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n = 1.4\n   \\]\n   Since \\( n \\) must be an integer, \\( w \\) cannot be odd.\n\nThus, the only possible value for \\( w \\) is 4. Therefore, Jed will have a total of 40 cards after \\(\\boxed{4}\\) weeks.",
