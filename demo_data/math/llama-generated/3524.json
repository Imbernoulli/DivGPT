        "To determine how much Jack has in yen, we need to convert each of his remaining currencies (pounds and euros) into yen and then sum these amounts with his existing yen.\n\nFirst, let's convert the pounds into yen. Jack has 42 pounds, and we know that 1 pound is equal to 100 yen. Therefore, the conversion is:\n\\[ 42 \\text{ pounds} \\times 100 \\text{ yen/pound} = 4200 \\text{ yen} \\]\n\nNext, let's convert the euros into yen. Jack has 11 euros, and we know that 1 euro is equal to 2 pounds. First, we convert the euros into pounds:\n\\[ 11 \\text{ euros} \\times 2 \\text{ pounds/euro} = 22 \\text{ pounds} \\]\nThen, we convert these pounds into yen:\n\\[ 22 \\text{ pounds} \\times 100 \\text{ yen/pound} = 2200 \\text{ yen} \\]\n\nNow, we sum the amounts in yen:\n\\[ 4200 \\text{ yen} + 2200 \\text{ yen} + 3000 \\text{ yen} = 9400 \\text{ yen} \\]\n\nThus, Jack has \\(\\boxed{9400}\\) yen.",

Therefore, we can calculate the value of the pounds in yen as follows:\n\\[ 42 \\text{ pounds} \\times 100 \\text{ yen/pound} = 4200 \\text{ yen} \\]\n\nNext, let's convert the euros into yen. Jack has 11 euros, and we know that 1 euro is equal to 2 pounds. Since 1 pound is equal to 100 yen, 1 euro is equal to:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ pounds/euro} \\times 100 \\text{ yen/pound} = 200 \\text{ yen/euro} \\]\nTherefore, we can calculate the value of the euros in yen as follows:\n\\[ 11 \\text{ euros} \\times 200 \\text{ yen/euro} = 2200 \\text{ yen} \\]\n\nNow, we need to add the value of the yen from the pounds, the euros, and the original yen. Jack originally has 3000 yen. So, we add:\n\\[ 4200 \\text{ yen} + 2200 \\text{ yen} + 3000 \\text{ yen} = 9400 \\text{ yen} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Jack has in yen is:\n\\[ \\boxed{9400} \\]",
