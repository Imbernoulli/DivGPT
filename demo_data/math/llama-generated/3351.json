        "To determine how many people stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration, we start by identifying the number of each type of guest initially present.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of women:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of women} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n\\]\nNext, we know the number of men is given as 15. The rest of the guests are children, so we calculate the number of children as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of children} = 60 - \\text{Number of women} - \\text{Number of men} = 60 - 30 - 15 = 15\n\\]\n\nIn the middle of the celebration, \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the men and 5 children left. We calculate the number of men who left:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men who left} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 15 = 5\n\\]\nSo, the number of men who stayed is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men who stayed} = 15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\nAnd the number of children who left is 5, so the number of children who stayed is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of children who stayed} = 15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, we add up the number of women, men who stayed, and children who stayed to find the total number of people who stayed:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of people who stayed} = \\text{Number of women} + \\text{Number of men who stayed} + \\text{Number of children who stayed} = 30 + 10 + 10 = 50\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people who stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many people stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of women.\n2. Determine the number of children.\n3.

Since half of the guests are women:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of women} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we know there are 15 men. The rest of the guests are children. Therefore, the number of children is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of children} = 60 - \\text{Number of women} - \\text{Number of men} = 60 - 30 - 15 = 15\n\\]\n\nIn the middle of the celebration, \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the men left. So, the number of men who left is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men who left} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 15 = 5\n\\]\n\nThe number of children who left is 5. Therefore, the number of men who stayed is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men who stayed} = 15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\nAnd the number of children who stayed is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of children who stayed} = 15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\n\nThe total number of people who stayed is the sum of the women, the men who stayed, and the children who stayed:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of people who stayed} = \\text{Number of women} + \\text{Number of men who stayed} + \\text{Number of children who stayed} = 30 + 10 + 10 = 50\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people who stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]",

Since half of the guests are women, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of women} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we know the number of men is given as 15.

Since \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the men left, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men who left} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 15 = 5\n\\]\nSo, the number of men who stayed is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men who stayed} = 15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many children left. We know that 5 children left, so the number of children who stayed is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of children who stayed} = 15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of people who stayed by adding the number of women, men who stayed, and children who stayed:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of people who stayed} = 30 + 10 + 10 = 50\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people who stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]",
