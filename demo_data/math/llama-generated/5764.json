        "To determine the number of gilled mushrooms on the fallen log, we start by defining the ratio of spotted mushrooms to gilled mushrooms. According to the problem, the ratio is 9:1.

The common denominator is 9:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{9}S + \\frac{9}{9}S = 30 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{10}{9}S = 30 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( S \\), multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{10}{9} \\), which is \\( \\frac{9}{10} \\):\n\\[ S = 30 \\times \\frac{9}{10} \\]\n\\[ S = 3 \\times 9 \\]\n\\[ S = 27 \\]\n\nNow that we know there are 27 spotted mushrooms, we can find the number of gilled mushrooms by using the ratio again:\n\\[ G = \\frac{1}{9}S \\]\n\\[ G = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 27 \\]\n\\[ G = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of gilled mushrooms on the fallen log's side is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
