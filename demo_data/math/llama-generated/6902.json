        "To determine how many hours of sleep Corveus lacks in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of sleep Corveus gets in a week.\n2. Calculate the total amount of sleep Corveus should get in a week according to his doctor's recommendation.\n3. Find the difference between the recommended sleep and the actual sleep.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of sleep Corveus gets in a week.**\n\nCorveus sleeps 4 hours a day. There are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total amount of sleep Corveus gets in a week is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 28 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of sleep Corveus should get in a week according to his doctor's recommendation.**\n\nCorveus's doctor recommended that he sleep 6 hours a day. There are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total amount of sleep Corveus should get in a week is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 42 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between the recommended sleep and the actual sleep.**\n\nThe difference between the recommended sleep and the actual sleep is:\n\\[ 42 \\text{ hours/week} - 28 \\text{ hours/week} = 14 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nThus, Corveus lacks \\(\\boxed{14}\\) hours of sleep in a week.",
        "To determine how many hours of sleep Corveus lacks in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the difference in sleep per day between what Corveus currently sleeps and what his doctor recommended.\n2. Multiply the daily sleep deficit by the number of days in a week to find the weekly sleep deficit.\n\nFirst, let's find the daily sleep deficit:\nCorveus currently sleeps 4 hours a day, and his doctor recommended 6 hours a day.\nThe daily sleep deficit is:\n\\[ 6 - 4 = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the weekly sleep deficit by multiplying the daily sleep deficit by the number of days in a week (which is 7):\n\\[ 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, Corveus lacks \\(\\boxed{14}\\) hours of sleep in a week.",

He should sleep 6 hours a day, and there are 7 days in a week:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 42 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the recommended sleep and the actual sleep:\n\\[ 42 \\text{ hours/week} - 28 \\text{ hours/week} = 14 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, Corveus lacks \\(\\boxed{14}\\) hours of sleep in a week.",
        "To determine how many hours of sleep Corveus lacks in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of sleep Corveus gets in a day.\n2. Calculate the amount of sleep Corveus's doctor recommends for him in a day.\n3. Find the difference in sleep per day.\n4. Multiply the daily sleep deficit by the number of days in a week.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Corveus sleeps 4 hours a day.\n2. His doctor recommends 6 hours of sleep a day.\n3. The difference in sleep per day is \\(6 - 4 = 2\\) hours.\n4. To find the total sleep deficit for a week, we multiply the daily sleep deficit by 7: \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\) hours.\n\nTherefore, Corveus lacks \\(\\boxed{14}\\) hours of sleep in a week.",
        "To determine how many hours of sleep Corveus lacks in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the difference in the number of hours Corveus sleeps each day compared to the recommended amount.\n2. Multiply the daily sleep deficit by the number of days in a week.\n\nFirst, we find the daily sleep deficit:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ hours/day} - 4 \\text{ hours/day} = 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the weekly sleep deficit by multiplying the daily sleep deficit by 7 (the number of days in a week):\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 14 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, Corveus lacks \\(\\boxed{14}\\) hours of sleep in a week."
