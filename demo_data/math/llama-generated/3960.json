Subtract the total number of jelly beans drawn from the original number of jelly beans in the bag.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of children who were allowed to draw jelly beans.**\n\nThere are 40 children in total, and 80% of them were allowed to draw jelly beans. So, we calculate:\n\\[ 0.80 \\times 40 = 32 \\]\nThis means 32 children were allowed to draw jelly beans.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of jelly beans drawn by all the children.**\n\nEach child who was allowed to draw jelly beans took 2 jelly beans. So, the total number of jelly beans drawn is:\n\\[ 32 \\times 2 = 64 \\]\nThis means 64 jelly beans were drawn in total.\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the total number of jelly beans drawn from the original number of jelly beans in the bag.**\n\nThe original number of jelly beans in the bag was 100. After the children took their share, the number of jelly beans remaining is:\n\\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of jelly beans remaining in the bag is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",

Subtract the total number of jelly beans drawn from the initial number of jelly beans in the bag.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of children who were allowed to draw jelly beans.
