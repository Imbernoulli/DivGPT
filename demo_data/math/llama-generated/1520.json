        "To determine the total cost for the family to visit the park and one attraction inside, we need to calculate the cost of the entrance tickets and the cost of the attraction tickets separately, and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the entrance tickets. The family consists of 4 children, 2 parents, and 1 grandmother. The entrance ticket to the park costs $5 for each person. Therefore, the total cost for the entrance tickets is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ dollars/person} \\times (4 + 2 + 1) \\text{ people} = 5 \\times 7 = 35 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the attraction tickets. The attraction ticket costs $2 for each child and $4 for each adult (parent or grandmother). Therefore, the total cost for the attraction tickets is:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ dollars/child} \\times 4 \\text{ children} + 4 \\text{ dollars/adult} \\times (2 + 1) \\text{ adults} = 2 \\times 4 + 4 \\times 3 = 8 + 12 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the cost of the entrance tickets and the cost of the attraction tickets to get the total cost for the family's visit:\n\\[\n35 \\text{ dollars} + 20 \\text{ dollars} = 55 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount the family would pay for visiting the park and one attraction inside is \\(\\boxed{55}\\).",
        "To determine the total cost for a family with 4 children, their parents, and their grandmother to visit the park and one attraction inside, we need to break down the costs step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the entrance fee for the park:**\n   - The entrance fee per person is $5.\n   - The family consists of 4 children, 2 parents, and 1 grandmother, which totals to \\(4 + 2 + 1 = 7\\) people.\n   - Therefore, the total entrance fee is \\(7 \\times 5 = 35\\) dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the attraction:**\n   - The attraction ticket for each child costs $2, and there are 4 children.
