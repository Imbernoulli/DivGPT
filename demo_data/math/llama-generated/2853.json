Add the number of sons and daughters to find the total number of children.\n\nFirst, we know from the problem statement that Sandro has three sons. Let's denote the number of sons as \\( S \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ S = 3 \\]\n\nNext, the problem states that Sandro has six times as many daughters as sons. Let's denote the number of daughters as \\( D \\). Therefore, we can express the number of daughters as:\n\\[ D = 6 \\times S \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( S \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ D = 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\]\n\nNow, to find the total number of children Sandro has, we add the number of sons and the number of daughters:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of children} = S + D = 3 + 18 = 21 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of children Sandro has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]",

Therefore, we can calculate the number of daughters as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of daughters} = 6 \\times \\text{Number of sons} = 6 \\times 3 = 18\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the number of sons and daughters to find the total number of children:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of children} = \\text{Number of sons} + \\text{Number of daughters} = 3 + 18 = 21\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of children Sandro has is \\boxed{21}.",
