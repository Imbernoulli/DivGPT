Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Larry currently has $15.\n2. Larry spent $5 on lunch.\n3. Larry gave his brother $2.\n\nThe total amount of money Larry spent and gave away is:\n\\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \\]\n\nTo find out how much Larry had at the beginning, we add the total amount he spent and gave away to the money he has now:\n\\[ 15 + 7 = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, Larry had \\(\\boxed{22}\\) dollars at the beginning.",
        "Let's denote the amount of money Larry had at the beginning as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we need to account for the expenses Larry incurred and the amount he gave away. Larry spent $5 on lunch and gave his brother $2, so his total decrease in money is:\n\\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAfter these expenses, Larry has $15 left. Therefore, the amount of money he had at the beginning can be expressed as:\n\\[ x - 7 = 15 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve the equation:\n\\[ x - 7 = 15 \\]\nWe do this by adding 7 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 15 + 7 \\]\n\\[ x = 22 \\]\n\nSo, Larry had \\(\\boxed{22}\\) dollars at the beginning.",
