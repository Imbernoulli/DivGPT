There are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\\[\n90 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 1080 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNow, we determine the number of steps by dividing the total height in inches by the height of each step:\n\\[\n1080 \\text{ inches} \\div 18 \\text{ inches/step} = 60 \\text{ steps}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of steps John climbs up is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{60}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many steps John climbs up, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total height of the stairs:**\n   - John climbs up 9 flights of stairs.\n   - Each flight is 10 feet.\n   - Therefore, the total height is:\n     \\[\n     9 \\text{ flights} \\times 10 \\text{ feet/flight} = 90 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the height from feet to inches:**\n   - There are 12 inches in a foot.\n   - Therefore, the total height in inches is:\n     \\[\n     90 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 1080 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of steps:**\n   - Each step is 18 inches.\n   - Therefore, the number of steps is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1080 \\text{ inches}}{18 \\text{ inches/step}} = 60 \\text{ steps}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of steps John climbs up is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
