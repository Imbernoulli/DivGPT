She figured that each cupcake cost $0.75 to make.  The first 2 dozen that she made burnt and she had to throw them out.  The next 2 came out perfectly and she ended up eating 5 cupcakes right away.  Later that day she made 2 more dozen cupcakes and decided to eat 4 more. If she sells the remaining cupcakes at $2.00 each, how much is her net profit?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cupcakes Prudence made.**\n\nPrudence made:\n- The first 2 dozen cupcakes (which burnt and were thrown out)\n- The next 2 dozen cupcakes (which came out perfectly)\n- Later, 2 more dozen cupcakes\n\nSince 1 dozen equals 12 cupcakes, the total number of cupcakes made is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 + 2 \\times 12 + 2 \\times 12 = 24 + 24 + 24 = 72 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of cupcakes she has left after eating some.**\n\nPrudence ate:\n- 5 cupcakes from the second batch\n- 4 cupcakes from the third batch\n\nSo, the total number of cupcakes eaten is:\n\\[ 5 + 4 = 9 \\]\n\nSince the first 24 cupcakes were burnt and thrown out, she only has the remaining cupcakes from the second and third batches after eating some. The number of cupcakes left is:\n\\[ 24 + 24 - 9 = 39 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of making the cupcakes.**\n\nThe cost to make each cupcake is $0.75. Therefore, the total cost of making 72 cupcakes is:\n\\[ 72 \\times 0.75 = 54 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling the remaining cupcakes.**\n\nPrudence sells each remaining cupcake at $2.00. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 39 cupcakes is:\n\\[ 39 \\times 2 = 78 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 5: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.**\n\nThe net profit is:\n\\[ 78 - 54 = 24 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, Prudence's net profit is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]",
        "To determine Prudence's net profit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes made:**\n   - Prudence initially made 2 dozen burnt cupcakes.\n   - She then made 2 dozen more cupcakes, but ate 5.\n   - Later, she made another 2 dozen cupcakes and ate 4 more.\n\n   First, convert dozens to individual cupcakes:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ dozen} = 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ cupcakes}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, calculate the total number of cupcakes made:\n   \\[\n   24 \\text{ (burnt)} + 24 \\text{ (next batch)} + 24 \\text{ (later batch)} = 72 \\text{ cupcakes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of cupcakes thrown out and eaten:**\n   - Prudence threw out the first 2 dozen burnt cupcakes:\n     \\[\n     24 \\text{ cupcakes}\n     \\]\n   - She ate 5 cupcakes from the second batch:\n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ cupcakes}\n     \\]\n   - She ate 4 cupcakes from the later batch:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ cupcakes}\n     \\]\n\n   Calculate the total number of cupcakes thrown out and eaten:\n   \\[\n   24 + 5 + 4 = 33 \\text{ cupcakes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of cupcakes remaining:**\n   Subtract the number of cupcakes thrown out and eaten from the total number of cupcakes made:\n   \\[\n   72 - 33 = 39 \\text{ cupcakes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the remaining cupcakes:**\n   Prudence sells each cupcake for $2.00:\n   \\[\n   39 \\text{ cupcakes} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per cupcake} = 78 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost of making the cupcakes:**\n   Each cupcake costs $0.75 to make:\n   \\[\n   72 \\text{ cupcakes} \\times 0.75 \\text{ dollars per cupcake} = 54 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the net profit:**\n   Subtract the total cost from the total revenue:\n   \\[\n   78 \\text{ dollars} - 54 \\text{ dollars} = 24 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Prudence's net profit is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
