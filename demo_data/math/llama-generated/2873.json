        "To determine how many more words Yvonne and Janna need to add to reach the 1000-word requirement, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of words written by Yvonne and Janna before editing.\n2. Determine the total number of words after editing.\n3. Find out how many more words are needed to reach 1000 words.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of words written by Yvonne and Janna before editing:\n- Yvonne wrote 400 words.\n- Janna wrote 150 more words than Yvonne, so Janna wrote \\(400 + 150 = 550\\) words.\n- Therefore, the total number of words written before editing is \\(400 + 550 = 950\\) words.\n\nNext, we determine the total number of words after editing:\n- They removed 20 words, so the number of words removed is 20.\n- They added twice as many words as they removed, so they added \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) words.\n- Therefore, the total number of words after editing is \\(950 - 20 + 40 = 970\\) words.\n\nFinally, we find out how many more words are needed to reach 1000 words:\n- The research paper requirement is 1000 words.\n- They have 970 words after editing.\n- Therefore, the number of words they need to add is \\(1000 - 970 = 30\\) words.\n\nThe number of words they should add to reach the research paper requirement is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

Find out how many more words are needed to meet the 1000-word requirement.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of words written by Yvonne and Janna:\n- Yvonne wrote 400 words.\n- Janna wrote 150 more words than Yvonne, so Janna wrote \\(400 + 150 = 550\\) words.\n- Therefore, the total number of words written is \\(400 + 550 = 950\\) words.\n\nNext, let's determine the total number of words after editing:\n- They removed 20 words.\n- They added twice as many words as they removed, so they added \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) words.\n- Therefore, the total number of words after editing is \\(950 - 20 + 40 = 970\\) words.\n\nFinally, let's find out how many more words are needed to reach the 1000-word requirement:\n- The requirement is 1000 words.\n- They currently have 970 words.\n- Therefore, they need \\(1000 - 970 = 30\\) more words.\n\nThe number of additional words they need to add is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
