        "To determine how many more paper plates Max needs, we start by calculating the total number of paper plates he currently has. Max has 22 green paper plates and 24 blue paper plates. Therefore, the total number of paper plates he currently has is:\n\n\\[ 22 + 24 = 46 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more paper plates Max needs to reach the total of 65 paper plates. We do this by subtracting the number of paper plates he currently has from the total number of paper plates he needs:\n\n\\[ 65 - 46 = 19 \\]\n\nSo, Max needs \\(\\boxed{19}\\) more paper plates.",
