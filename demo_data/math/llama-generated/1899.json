        "To determine the average speed of Mr. Maxwell's return journey, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the distance to work.\n2. Use the distance to work to find the average speed of the return journey.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance to work. Mr. Maxwell drives to work in the morning at an average speed of 30 mph and it takes him 1 hour. The distance can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = 30 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 1 \\, \\text{hour} = 30 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nSo, the distance to work is 30 miles. Since the distance to work is the same as the distance back home, the distance back home is also 30 miles.\n\nNext, we need to find the average speed of the return journey. The return journey takes Mr. Maxwell 1.5 hours. Using the formula for average speed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{30 \\, \\text{miles}}{1.5 \\, \\text{hours}} = 20 \\, \\text{mph}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average speed of Mr. Maxwell's return journey is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",
