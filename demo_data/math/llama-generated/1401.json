        "To determine how many hours left over Madeline has in a week, we need to calculate the total number of hours she spends on her various activities and then subtract this from the total number of hours in a week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of hours Madeline spends on her activities in a week:\n\n1. **Class time**: Madeline spends 18 hours a week in class.\n2. **Homework**: Madeline spends 4 hours per day working on homework. Since there are 7 days in a week, she spends \\(4 \\times 7 = 28\\) hours a week on homework.\n3. **Sleeping**: Madeline spends 8 hours per day sleeping. Since there are 7 days in a week, she spends \\(8 \\times 7 = 56\\) hours a week sleeping.\n4. **Part-time work**: Madeline spends 20 hours a week working part-time.\n\nNow, let's add up all these hours:\n\\[18 + 28 + 56 + 20 = 122\\]\n\nThere are 168 hours in a week. To find out how many hours left over Madeline has, we subtract the total number of hours she spends on her activities from the total number of hours in a week:\n\\[168 - 122 = 46\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hours left over Madeline has is \\(\\boxed{46}\\).",
        "To determine how many hours left over Madeline has, we need to calculate the total number of hours she spends on her daily and weekly activities and then subtract that from the total number of hours in a week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of hours Madeline spends on her daily activities in a week. She spends 4 hours per day working on homework and 8 hours per day sleeping. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the weekly total for these activities as follows:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 28 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\\[\n8 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 56 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\n\\[\n28 \\text{ hours/week} + 56 \\text{ hours/week} = 84 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the hours she spends in class and the hours she works part-time to the total number of hours she spends on her daily activities:\n\n\\[\n18 \\text{ hours/week} + 20 \\text{ hours/week} + 84 \\text{ hours/week} = 122 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\nThere are 168 hours in a week.
