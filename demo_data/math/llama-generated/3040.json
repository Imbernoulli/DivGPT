        "Let's define the number of years Tom has been teaching as \\( T \\). According to the problem, Devin has been teaching for 5 less than half the number of years that Tom has. So, the number of years Devin has been teaching can be expressed as \\( \\frac{T}{2} - 5 \\).\n\nThe total number of years Tom and Devin have been teaching is 70.
