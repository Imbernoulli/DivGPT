According to the problem, her allowance was $2 more than $8:\n\\[\n8 + 2 = 10\n\\]\nSo, Kathleen's allowance during middle school was $10.\n\nNext, let's calculate Kathleen's allowance during her senior year. The problem states that her allowance was $5 more than twice her middle school allowance. First, we find twice her middle school allowance:\n\\[\n2 \\times 10 = 20\n\\]\nThen, we add $5 to this amount:\n\\[\n20 + 5 = 25\n\\]\nSo, Kathleen's allowance during her senior year was $25.\n\nNow, we find the difference between her senior year allowance and her middle school allowance:\n\\[\n25 - 10 = 15\n\\]\n\nTo calculate the percentage increase, we divide the difference by her middle school allowance and then multiply by 100:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{15}{10} \\right) \\times 100 = 1.5 \\times 100 = 150\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase in Kathleen's weekly allowance is \\boxed{150}.",

First, we need to find twice her middle school allowance:\n\\[\n2 \\times 10 = 20\n\\]\nThen, we add $5 to this amount:\n\\[\n20 + 5 = 25\n\\]\nSo, Kathleen's weekly allowance during her senior year was $25.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the senior year allowance and the middle school allowance:\n\\[\n25 - 10 = 15\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage increase based on the middle school allowance. The percentage increase is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\text{Difference}}{\\text{Middle school allowance}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{15}{10} \\right) \\times 100 = 1.5 \\times 100 = 150\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase in Kathleen's weekly allowance is \\boxed{150}.",

Calculate Kathleen's allowance during her senior year.\n3. Find the difference between the senior year allowance and the middle school allowance.\n4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the middle school allowance.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Kathleen's allowance during middle school.**\n\nKathleen's middle school allowance is $2 more than $8.\n\\[\n8 + 2 = 10\n\\]\nSo, her middle school allowance is $10.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Kathleen's allowance during her senior year.**\n\nKathleen's senior year allowance is $5 more than twice her middle school allowance. First, we need to find twice her middle school allowance.\n\\[\n2 \\times 10 = 20\n\\]\nThen, we add $5 to this amount.\n\\[\n20 + 5 = 25\n\\]\nSo, her senior year allowance is $25.\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between the senior year allowance and the middle school allowance.**\n\nWe subtract the middle school allowance from the senior year allowance.\n\\[\n25 - 10 = 15\n\\]\nSo, the difference is $15.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase based on the middle school allowance.**\n\nTo find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the middle school allowance and then multiply by 100.\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{10} \\times 100 = 1.5 \\times 100 = 150\n\\]\nSo, the percentage increase in Kathleen's weekly allowance is \\boxed{150}."
