        "To determine the combined population of Port Perry and Lazy Harbor, we start by identifying the population of each town based on the information given.\n\nFirst, we know that the population of Port Perry is seven times the population of Wellington. Since the population of Wellington is 900, we can calculate the population of Port Perry as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Population of Port Perry} = 7 \\times \\text{Population of Wellington} = 7 \\times 900 = 6300\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that the population of Port Perry is 800 more than the population of Lazy Harbor. Let's denote the population of Lazy Harbor by \\( L \\). According to the problem, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Population of Port Perry} = \\text{Population of Lazy Harbor} + 800\n\\]\nSubstituting the population of Port Perry that we found earlier, we get:\n\\[\n6300 = L + 800\n\\]\nTo find the population of Lazy Harbor, we solve for \\( L \\):\n\\[\nL = 6300 - 800 = 5500\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the combined population of Port Perry and Lazy Harbor:\n\\[\n\\text{Combined population} = \\text{Population of Port Perry} + \\text{Population of Lazy Harbor} = 6300 + 5500 = 11800\n\\]\n\nThus, the combined population of Port Perry and Lazy Harbor is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{11800}\n\\]",

Therefore, we can calculate the population of Port Perry as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Population of Port Perry} = 7 \\times \\text{Population of Wellington} = 7 \\times 900 = 6300\n\\]\n\nNext, we know the population of Port Perry is 800 more than the population of Lazy Harbor.

This gives us the equation:\n\\[ P = 7W \\]\n\nWe are also given that the population of Port Perry is 800 more than the population of Lazy Harbor. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ P = L + 800 \\]\n\nWe know from the problem statement that the population of Wellington is 900. So, we can substitute \\( W = 900 \\) into the first equation:\n\\[ P = 7 \\times 900 = 6300 \\]\n\nNow that we know the population of Port Perry is 6300, we can substitute \\( P = 6300 \\) into the second equation to find the population of Lazy Harbor:\n\\[ 6300 = L + 800 \\]\n\\[ L = 6300 - 800 = 5500 \\]\n\nTo find the total population of Port Perry and Lazy Harbor combined, we add their populations together:\n\\[ P + L = 6300 + 5500 = 11800 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people who live in Port Perry and Lazy Harbor combined is \\(\\boxed{11800}\\).",
