Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total time in hours by 60:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we determine how many miles Paul runs in the total time. Since he runs a mile in 12 minutes, we divide the total time in minutes by the time it takes to run one mile:\n\\[\n180 \\text{ minutes} \\div 12 \\text{ minutes/mile} = 15 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of miles Paul runs is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
        "To determine how many miles Paul runs while watching movies, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time Paul spends watching movies.\n2. Determine how many miles he runs in that total time.\n\nFirst, let's find the total time Paul spends watching movies. He watches two movies, and the average length of each movie is 1.5 hours. Therefore, the total time is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ movies} \\times 1.5 \\text{ hours/movie} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the total time from hours to minutes because Paul's running speed is given in minutes per mile. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we know that Paul runs a mile in 12 minutes. To find out how many miles he runs in 180 minutes, we divide the total running time by the time it takes to run one mile:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ minutes} \\div 12 \\text{ minutes/mile} = 15 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of miles Paul runs is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
