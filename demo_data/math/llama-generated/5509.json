        "To determine the total number of hours worked by Amber, Armand, and Ella, we need to calculate the hours each person worked individually and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that Amber worked for 12 hours. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Hours worked by Amber} = 12 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Armand worked one-third as long as Amber. Therefore, we calculate the hours worked by Armand as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Hours worked by Armand} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Ella worked twice as long as Amber. Therefore, we calculate the hours worked by Ella as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Hours worked by Ella} = 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the hours worked by Amber, Armand, and Ella to find the total number of hours worked:\n\\[ \\text{Total hours worked} = 12 + 4 + 24 = 40 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours worked by the three people is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
