        "To determine the total cost of the damages Jack caused, we need to calculate the cost of the slashed tires and the smashed front window separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the slashed tires. Jack slashed three tires, and each tire costs $250. Therefore, the total cost for the tires is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 250 = 750 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the smashed front window. The window costs $700. Therefore, the total cost for the window is:\n\\[ 700 \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the tires and the cost of the window to find the total amount Jack will have to pay for the damages:\n\\[ 750 + 700 = 1450 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Jack will have to pay for the damages is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1450} \\]",
