        "To determine how many desktop computers Mr. Lu's store sold, we start by calculating the number of laptops and netbooks sold.\n\nFirst, we find the number of laptops sold. Since half of the sales are laptops, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of laptops} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 72 = 36\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the number of netbooks sold. Since one-third of the sales are netbooks, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of netbooks} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 72 = 24\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the number of desktop computers sold by subtracting the number of laptops and netbooks from the total number of computers sold:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of desktop computers} = 72 - \\text{Number of laptops} - \\text{Number of netbooks} = 72 - 36 - 24 = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of desktop computers sold is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
