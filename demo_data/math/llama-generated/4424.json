The problem states that Seth sold 6 more candy bars than 3 times the number of candy bars that Max sold. If we let \\( S \\) represent the number of candy bars Seth sold, then we can write the relationship between \\( S \\) and \\( M \\) as:\n\n\\[ S = 3M + 6 \\]\n\nNow, we substitute the value of \\( M \\) (which is 24) into the equation:\n\n\\[ S = 3(24) + 6 \\]\n\nWe perform the multiplication first:\n\n\\[ S = 72 + 6 \\]\n\nThen, we add the numbers together:\n\n\\[ S = 78 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of candy bars Seth sold is \\(\\boxed{78}\\).",
