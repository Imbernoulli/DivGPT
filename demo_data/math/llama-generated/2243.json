Determine how many of those knockouts were in the first round.\n\nFirst, we know that 50 percent of Rocky's 190 fights were knockouts. So, we calculate the number of knockouts as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of knockouts} = 50\\% \\times 190 = 0.50 \\times 190 = 95\n\\]\nNext, we know that 20 percent of the knockouts were in the first round. So, we calculate the number of first-round knockouts as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of first-round knockouts} = 20\\% \\times 95 = 0.20 \\times 95 = 19\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of knockouts Rocky had in the first round is \\boxed{19}."
