        "To determine how many magnets Peter has, we start by calculating how many magnets Adam gave away. Adam initially has 18 magnets, and he gave away a third of them. Therefore, the number of magnets Adam gave away is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{18}{3} = 6 \\]\n\nAfter giving away 6 magnets, Adam has:\n\n\\[ 18 - 6 = 12 \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, after giving away the magnets, Adam has half as many magnets as Peter. Let \\( P \\) represent the number of magnets Peter has. Then we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 12 = \\frac{P}{2} \\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[ 12 \\times 2 = P \\]\n\n\\[ P = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, Peter has \\(\\boxed{24}\\) magnets.",
