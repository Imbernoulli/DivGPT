Subtract the amount of tomatoes sold on Saturday.\n3. Subtract the amount of tomatoes that rotted on Sunday.\n4. Add the amount of tomatoes received in the new shipment on Monday.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. On Friday, the store received 1000 kg of tomatoes.\n2. On Saturday, Marta sold 300 kg of tomatoes. So, the remaining tomatoes after Saturday are:\n   \\[\n   1000 \\text{ kg} - 300 \\text{ kg} = 700 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n3. On Sunday, 200 kg of tomatoes rotted and were thrown away. So, the remaining tomatoes after Sunday are:\n   \\[\n   700 \\text{ kg} - 200 \\text{ kg} = 500 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n4. On Monday morning, another shipment arrived, which was twice the size of the first one. Since the first shipment was 1000 kg, the second shipment was:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 1000 \\text{ kg} = 2000 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n   Adding this to the remaining tomatoes from Sunday, the total amount of tomatoes ready for sale on Tuesday is:\n   \\[\n   500 \\text{ kg} + 2000 \\text{ kg} = 2500 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of kilograms of tomatoes Marta had ready for sale on Tuesday is \\boxed{2500}.",
