The base fine for speeding is $50 but additional penalties apply in this case.  The fine is increased by $2 for every mile per hour Mark was going over the speed limit. He was going 75 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone. The fine is also doubled because he was in a school zone. Finally, the judge makes Mark pay $300 in court costs and he also has to pay his lawyer $80/hour for three hours of work.

Double the fine because it was in a school zone.\n3. Add the court costs.\n4. Add the cost of the lawyer's services.\n\nLet's start with the base fine and the additional fine. The base fine for speeding is $50, and the fine is increased by $2 for every mile per hour Mark was going over the speed limit. Mark was going 75 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone, so he was going \\(75 - 30 = 45\\) miles per hour over the speed limit. Therefore, the additional fine is \\(45 \\times 2 = 90\\) dollars.

The fine is increased by $2 for every mile per hour over the speed limit, so the additional fine is \\(45 \\times 2 = 90\\) dollars. Adding this to the base fine of $50, we get \\(50 + 90 = 140\\) dollars. Since the fine is doubled because he was in a school zone, we multiply $140 by 2 to get \\(140 \\times 2 = 280\\) dollars.\n\nNext, we add the court costs of $300 to the fine.

        "First, we calculate the base fine for speeding. The base fine is $50.\n\nNext, we determine the additional penalty for exceeding the speed limit. Mark was going 75 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone, so he was going \\(75 - 30 = 45\\) miles per hour over the speed limit. The fine is increased by $2 for every mile per hour over the speed limit, so the additional penalty is \\(45 \\times 2 = 90\\) dollars.\n\nAdding the additional penalty to the base fine, we get \\(50 + 90 = 140\\) dollars. Since the fine is doubled because Mark was in a school zone, the fine is \\(140 \\times 2 = 280\\) dollars.\n\nThen, we add the court costs of $300 to the fine, so we have \\(280 + 300 = 580\\) dollars.\n\nFinally, we add the cost of the lawyer's work. The lawyer charges $80 per hour for three hours, so the lawyer's total cost is \\(80 \\times 3 = 240\\) dollars. Adding this to the fine, we get \\(580 + 240 = 820\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Mark owes for this speeding ticket is \\(\\boxed{820}\\).",
        "To determine how much Mark owes for the speeding ticket, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the base fine for speeding.\n2. Determine the additional fine based on the speed over the limit.\n3. Double the fine because it was in a school zone.\n4. Add the court costs.\n5. Add the cost of the lawyer's work.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Base fine for speeding:**\n   The base fine is $50.\n\n2. **Additional fine based on speed over the limit:**\n   Mark was going 75 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone. The speed over the limit is:\n   \\[\n   75 - 30 = 45 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n   The additional fine is $2 for every mile per hour over the limit:\n   \\[\n   45 \\times 2 = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Adding this to the base fine gives:\n   \\[\n   50 + 90 = 140 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Double the fine because it was in a school zone:**\n   The fine is doubled:\n   \\[\n   140 \\times 2 = 280 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Add the court costs:**\n   The court costs are $300.\n\n5. **Add the cost of the lawyer's work:**\n   The lawyer charges $80 per hour for three hours of work:\n   \\[\n   80 \\times 3 = 240 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we add up all the amounts:\n\\[\n280 + 300 + 240 = 820 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mark owes \\(\\boxed{820}\\) dollars for the speeding ticket."
