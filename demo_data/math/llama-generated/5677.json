        "To determine the reduced price of the shirts and leather jackets after the 20% discount, we first calculate the discount amount for each item.\n\nThe original price of a shirt is $60. A 20% discount on the shirt is:\n\\[ 60 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 60 \\times 0.20 = 12 \\]\nSo, the reduced price of a shirt is:\n\\[ 60 - 12 = 48 \\]\n\nThe original price of a leather jacket is $90. A 20% discount on the leather jacket is:\n\\[ 90 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 90 \\times 0.20 = 18 \\]\nSo, the reduced price of a leather jacket is:\n\\[ 90 - 18 = 72 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for Teagan buying 5 shirts and 10 leather jackets at the reduced prices. The cost for 5 shirts is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 48 = 240 \\]\nThe cost for 10 leather jackets is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 72 = 720 \\]\nTherefore, the total amount of money Teagan will pay is:\n\\[ 240 + 720 = 960 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{960} \\]",

The original price of a shirt is $60, and the store reduced the prices by 20%. Therefore, the reduced price is:\n\\[ 60 - (60 \\times 0.20) = 60 - 12 = 48 \\]\nSo, the reduced price of one shirt is $48.\n\nNext, let's calculate the reduced price of one leather jacket. The original price of a leather jacket is $90, and the store reduced the prices by 20%. Therefore, the reduced price is:\n\\[ 90 - (90 \\times 0.20) = 90 - 18 = 72 \\]\nSo, the reduced price of one leather jacket is $72.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for 5 shirts at the reduced price:\n\\[ 5 \\times 48 = 240 \\]\nSo, the total cost for 5 shirts is $240.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost for 10 leather jackets at the reduced price:\n\\[ 10 \\times 72 = 720 \\]\nSo, the total cost for 10 leather jackets is $720.\n\nFinally, let's add the two amounts together to get the total cost:\n\\[ 240 + 720 = 960 \\]\nSo, the total amount of money Teagan will pay is \\(\\boxed{960}\\).",
        "To determine the reduced prices of the items after the 20% discount, we first calculate the discount amount for each item.\n\nFor the shirt:\nThe original price is $60. A 20% discount means the discount amount is:\n\\[ 60 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 60 \\times 0.20 = 12 \\]\nSo, the reduced price of the shirt is:\n\\[ 60 - 12 = 48 \\]\n\nFor the leather jacket:\nThe original price is $90.

Calculate the total cost for 10 leather jackets at the reduced price.\n5. Add the total costs from steps 3 and 4 to find the total amount Teagan will pay.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the reduced price of each shirt. The original price of a shirt is $60, and the store reduced the price by 20%. Therefore, the reduced price of each shirt is:\n\\[ 60 - (60 \\times 0.20) = 60 - 12 = 48 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the reduced price of each leather jacket. The original price of a leather jacket is $90, and the store reduced the price by 20%. Therefore, the reduced price of each leather jacket is:\n\\[ 90 - (90 \\times 0.20) = 90 - 18 = 72 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for 5 shirts at the reduced price. The reduced price of each shirt is $48, so the total cost for 5 shirts is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 48 = 240 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost for 10 leather jackets at the reduced price. The reduced price of each leather jacket is $72, so the total cost for 10 leather jackets is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 72 = 720 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, let's add the total costs from steps 3 and 4 to find the total amount Teagan will pay:\n\\[ 240 + 720 = 960 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Teagan will pay for buying 5 shirts and 10 leather jackets at the reduced prices is \\(\\boxed{960}\\).",
