        "To determine Robert's monthly expenses, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Robert's total earnings for the month.\n2. Determine how much he allocated to savings.\n3. Calculate his monthly expenses by subtracting his savings from his total earnings.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Robert's total earnings for the month. Robert's earnings consist of his basic salary plus his commission. His basic salary is $1250, and his commission is 10% of his total sales. His total sales last month were $23600.\n\nThe commission can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Commission} = 0.10 \\times 23600 = 2360\n\\]\n\nSo, Robert's total earnings for the month are:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Earnings} = \\text{Basic Salary} + \\text{Commission} = 1250 + 2360 = 3610\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much Robert allocated to savings. He allocated 20% of his total earnings to savings. Therefore, his savings are:\n\\[\n\\text{Savings} = 0.20 \\times 3610 = 722\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate Robert's monthly expenses by subtracting his savings from his total earnings:\n\\[\n\\text{Monthly Expenses} = \\text{Total Earnings} - \\text{Savings} = 3610 - 722 = 2888\n\\]\n\nThus, Robert's monthly expenses last month were:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2888}\n\\]",
