        "To determine the weight of the water collection tank after the rainstorm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the volume of water in the tank after the rainstorm.\n2. Determine the weight of the water.\n3. Add the weight of the water to the weight of the empty tank.\n\nFirst, we calculate the volume of water in the tank. The tank is filled to 80% of its capacity, and its capacity is 200 gallons. Therefore, the volume of water in the tank is:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ gallons} \\times 0.80 = 160 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the weight of the water. Since each gallon of water weighs 8 pounds, the weight of 160 gallons of water is:\n\\[ 160 \\text{ gallons} \\times 8 \\text{ pounds/gallon} = 1280 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the weight of the water to the weight of the empty tank. The empty tank weighs 80 pounds, so the total weight of the tank now is:\n\\[ 80 \\text{ pounds} + 1280 \\text{ pounds} = 1360 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThus, the weight of the tank now is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1360} \\]",
