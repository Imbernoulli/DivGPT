        "Let's denote the number of mangoes Dilan has as \\(D\\) and the number of mangoes Ashley has as \\(A\\). According to the problem, Alexis has four times as many mangoes as Dilan and Ashley combined. This can be written with the equation:\n\n\\[60 = 4(D + A)\\]\n\nTo find the total number of mangoes that Dilan and Ashley have combined, we need to solve for \\(D + A\\). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[D + A = \\frac{60}{4} = 15\\]\n\nNow, we know that Dilan and Ashley together have 15 mangoes. Since Alexis has 60 mangoes, the total number of mangoes that Alexis, Dilan, and Ashley have combined is:\n\n\\[60 + D + A = 60 + 15 = 75\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of mangoes that all of them have combined is \\(\\boxed{75}\\).",

This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of mangoes Alexis has} = 4 \\times (\\text{Number of mangoes Dilan has} + \\text{Number of mangoes Ashley has})\n\\]\nWe know that Alexis has 60 mangoes, so we can substitute 60 for the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n60 = 4 \\times (D + A)\n\\]\nTo find the total number of mangoes Dilan and Ashley have combined, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[\nD + A = \\frac{60}{4} = 15\n\\]\nNow, we know that Dilan and Ashley together have 15 mangoes. To find the total number of mangoes that Alexis, Dilan, and Ashley have combined, we add the number of mangoes Alexis has to the number of mangoes Dilan and Ashley have combined:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of mangoes} = \\text{Number of mangoes Alexis has} + \\text{Number of mangoes Dilan and Ashley have combined} = 60 + 15 = 75\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of mangoes that Alexis, Dilan, and Ashley have combined is \\boxed{75}.",
        "To determine the total number of mangoes that Alexis, Dilan, and Ashley have combined, we start by defining the variables and using the given information.\n\nLet \\( D \\) represent the number of mangoes Dilan has.\nLet \\( A \\) represent the number of mangoes Ashley has.\n\nAccording to the problem, Alexis has four times as many mangoes as Dilan and Ashley combined. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Alexis's mangoes} = 4 \\times (\\text{Dilan's mangoes} + \\text{Ashley's mangoes})\n\\]\n\nWe know that Alexis has 60 mangoes.
