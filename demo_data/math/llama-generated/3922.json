        "To determine the total amount Fabian spent on his new computer mouse and keyboard, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of the mouse.\n2. Calculate the cost of the keyboard, which is three times the cost of the mouse.\n3. Add the cost of the mouse and the cost of the keyboard to find the total amount spent.\n\nFirst, we know the cost of the mouse is $16. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of the mouse} = 16 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the keyboard, which is three times the cost of the mouse:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of the keyboard} = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the mouse and the cost of the keyboard to find the total amount spent:\n\\[ \\text{Total amount spent} = \\text{Cost of the mouse} + \\text{Cost of the keyboard} = 16 + 48 = 64 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Fabian spent on his new accessories is:\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]",
