        "To determine the price of three kilograms of sugar and one kilogram of salt, we start by finding the cost of one kilogram of salt. We know from the problem that the price of two kilograms of sugar and five kilograms of salt is $5.50, and that a kilogram of sugar costs $1.50.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of two kilograms of sugar:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ kg} \\times \\$1.50/\\text{kg} = \\$3.00\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the cost of the sugar from the total cost to find the cost of five kilograms of salt:\n\\[\n\\$5.50 - \\$3.00 = \\$2.50\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the cost of one kilogram of salt by dividing the total cost of five kilograms of salt by five:\n\\[\n\\$2.50 \\div 5 = \\$0.50\n\\]\n\nWith the cost of one kilogram of salt known, we can now calculate the cost of three kilograms of sugar and one kilogram of salt. The cost of three kilograms of sugar is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ kg} \\times \\$1.50/\\text{kg} = \\$4.50\n\\]\n\nAdding the cost of one kilogram of salt, we get:\n\\[\n\\$4.50 + \\$0.50 = \\$5.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the price of three kilograms of sugar and one kilogram of salt is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
