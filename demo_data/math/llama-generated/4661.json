        "To determine the total weight of onions harvested by Titan's father, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of bags transported in total.\n2. Determine the total weight of the onions based on the number of bags and the weight of each bag.\n\nFirst, let's find out the total number of bags transported. Titan's father makes 20 trips, and he carries 10 bags per trip. Therefore, the total number of bags transported is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ trips} \\times 10 \\text{ bags/trip} = 200 \\text{ bags}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out the total weight of the onions. Each bag weighs 50 kg, so the total weight of the onions is:\n\\[\n200 \\text{ bags} \\times 50 \\text{ kg/bag} = 10000 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total weight of onions harvested by Titan's father is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10000}\n\\]",
