Add the remaining weights of the rice, green beans, and sugar to get the total remaining stock.\n\nLet's start with the weight of the green beans. According to the problem, the green beans weigh 60 kg.\n\\[ \\text{Weight of green beans} = 60 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nNext, we find the weight of the rice. The problem states that the rice weighs 30 kg less than the green beans.\n\\[ \\text{Weight of rice} = 60 \\text{ kg} - 30 \\text{ kg} = 30 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nNow, we find the weight of the sugar. The problem states that the green beans weigh 10 kg more than the sugar.\n\\[ \\text{Weight of sugar} = 60 \\text{ kg} - 10 \\text{ kg} = 50 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the weight of the rice lost. The problem states that \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the rice was lost.\n\\[ \\text{Weight of rice lost} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 30 \\text{ kg} = 10 \\text{ kg} \\]\nSo, the remaining weight of the rice is:\n\\[ \\text{Remaining weight of rice} = 30 \\text{ kg} - 10 \\text{ kg} = 20 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the weight of the sugar lost. The problem states that \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the sugar was lost.\n\\[ \\text{Weight of sugar lost} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 50 \\text{ kg} = 10 \\text{ kg} \\]\nSo, the remaining weight of the sugar is:\n\\[ \\text{Remaining weight of sugar} = 50 \\text{ kg} - 10 \\text{ kg} = 40 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the remaining weights of the rice, green beans, and sugar to get the total remaining stock.\n\\[ \\text{Total remaining stock} = 20 \\text{ kg} + 60 \\text{ kg} + 40 \\text{ kg} = 120 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nThus, the weight of the remaining stock is \\(\\boxed{120}\\) kg.",
