There are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in every machine in the launderette. When Erin empties all of the machines and cashes in the change, she has a total of $90. She had no money before she emptied the machines and each machine held the same amount of money. How many machines are in the launderette?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
