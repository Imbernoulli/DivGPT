        "To determine the total value of Gwen's stocks at the end of the year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial investment in each stock.\n2. Determine the value of each stock after one year.\n3. Sum the values of all three stocks.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial investment in each stock. Since Gwen spent one-third of her $900 bonus on each stock, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Initial investment in stock A} = \\frac{900}{3} = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Initial investment in stock B} = \\frac{900}{3} = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Initial investment in stock C} = \\frac{900}{3} = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the value of each stock after one year. Stock A and stock B doubled in value, so:\n\\[\n\\text{Value of stock A after one year} = 300 \\times 2 = 600 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Value of stock B after one year} = 300 \\times 2 = 600 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nStock C lost half of its value, so:\n\\[\n\\text{Value of stock C after one year} = 300 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the values of all three stocks to find the total value of Gwen's stocks at the end of the year:\n\\[\n\\text{Total value of stocks} = 600 + 600 + 150 = 1350 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total value of Gwen's stocks at the end of the year is \\(\\boxed{1350}\\).",

Stock A and stock B doubled in value, so:\n\\[\n\\text{Value of stock A after one year} = 300 \\times 2 = 600\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Value of stock B after one year} = 300 \\times 2 = 600\n\\]\nStock C lost half of its value, so:\n\\[\n\\text{Value of stock C after one year} = 300 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 150\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the values of all three stocks to find the total value of Gwen's stocks at the end of the year:\n\\[\n\\text{Total value of stocks} = 600 + 600 + 150 = 1350\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of Gwen's stocks at the end of the year is \\(\\boxed{1350}\\).",
