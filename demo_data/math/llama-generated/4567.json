        "To determine how many bunnies Michael has, we need to calculate the number of dogs and cats first and then subtract these from the total number of pets.\n\n1. Calculate the number of dogs:\n   Michael has 25% of his pets as dogs. Since he has 36 pets in total, we can find the number of dogs by multiplying 36 by 25% (or 0.25).\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of dogs} = 36 \\times 0.25 = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of cats:\n   Michael has 50% of his pets as cats. Using the total number of pets, we can find the number of cats by multiplying 36 by 50% (or 0.50).\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cats} = 36 \\times 0.50 = 18\n   \\]\n\n3.
