        "To determine the total square feet of wall that Matt needs to paint, we need to calculate the area of each wall in both the living room and the bedroom, and then sum these areas.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the walls in the living room. The living room is a square with each side measuring 40 feet, and all walls are 10 feet tall. Since Matt needs to paint three walls, we can calculate the area of one wall and then multiply by 3:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one wall in the living room} = 40 \\text{ feet} \\times 10 \\text{ feet} = 400 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total area of three walls in the living room} = 3 \\times 400 \\text{ square feet} = 1200 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the area of the walls in the bedroom. The bedroom is a rectangle with a length of 12 feet and a width of 10 feet, and all walls are 10 feet tall. Since Matt needs to paint all four walls, we can calculate the area of each pair of opposite walls and then sum these areas:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of two walls in the bedroom} = 2 \\times (12 \\text{ feet} \\times 10 \\text{ feet}) = 2 \\times 120 \\text{ square feet} = 240 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the other two walls in the bedroom} = 2 \\times (10 \\text{ feet} \\times 10 \\text{ feet}) = 2 \\times 100 \\text{ square feet} = 200 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total area of four walls in the bedroom} = 240 \\text{ square feet} + 200 \\text{ square feet} = 440 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the areas of the walls in the living room and the bedroom to find the total area Matt needs to paint:\n\\[\n\\text{Total area to be painted} = 1200 \\text{ square feet} + 440 \\text{ square feet} = 1640 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total square feet of wall that Matt needs to paint is \\boxed{1640}.",
