Sum the lengths in inches.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total length of the ladders Keaton climbed.**\n\nKeaton climbed a 30-foot ladder twenty times. Therefore, the total length of the ladders Keaton climbed is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ feet} \\times 20 = 600 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total length of the ladders Reece climbed.**\n\nReece climbed a ladder that is 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder. So, the length of Reece's ladder is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ feet} - 4 \\text{ feet} = 26 \\text{ feet} \\]\nReece climbed this ladder 15 times. Therefore, the total length of the ladders Reece climbed is:\n\\[ 26 \\text{ feet} \\times 15 = 390 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert the total length from feet to inches.**\n\nThere are 12 inches in a foot. So, the total length of the ladders Keaton climbed in inches is:\n\\[ 600 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 = 7200 \\text{ inches} \\]\nThe total length of the ladders Reece climbed in inches is:\n\\[ 390 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 = 4680 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Sum the lengths in inches.**\n\nThe total length of the ladders that both workers climbed in inches is:\n\\[ 7200 \\text{ inches} + 4680 \\text{ inches} = 11880 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nThus, the total length of the ladders that both workers climbed in inches is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11880} \\]",
