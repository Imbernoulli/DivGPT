        "Let's start by identifying the given information and translating it into mathematical expressions.\n\n1. John's father is 40 years old.\n2. John is half times younger than his father. This means John's age is half of his father's age.\n3. John's father is 4 years older than John's mother. This means John's mother's age is John's father's age minus 4.\n\nFirst, calculate John's age:\n\\[\n\\text{John's age} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{John's father's age} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate John's mother's age:\n\\[\n\\text{John's mother's age} = \\text{John's father's age} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36\n\\]\n\nNow, find the age difference between John and his mother:\n\\[\n\\text{Age difference} = \\text{John's mother's age} - \\text{John's age} = 36 - 20 = 16\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the age difference between John and his mother is \\boxed{16}.",

Therefore, we can calculate John's age as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{John's age} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Father's age} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out John's mother's age. The problem states that John's father is 4 years older than John's mother. Therefore, we can calculate John's mother's age as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mother's age} = \\text{Father's age} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36\n\\]\n\nNow that we have John's age (20 years) and his mother's age (36 years), we can find the age difference between John and his mother by subtracting John's age from his mother's age:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Age difference} = \\text{Mother's age} - \\text{John's age} = 36 - 20 = 16\n\\]\n\nThus, the age difference between John and his mother is \\boxed{16}.",
