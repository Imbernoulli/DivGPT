Since she brought home 3 bags of birthday hats and each bag contains 15 hats, we calculate the total number of hats as follows:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 15 = 45\n\\]\n\nNext, we account for the hats that Miggy tore off. Miggy tore off 5 hats, so we subtract 5 from the total number of hats:\n\n\\[\n45 - 5 = 40\n\\]\n\nAfter Miggy tore off the hats, 40 hats remained. During the party, 25 hats were used. To find out how many hats were unused, we subtract the number of hats used from the remaining number of hats:\n\n\\[\n40 - 25 = 15\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of unused hats is \\boxed{15}.",
        "To determine the number of unused hats, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hats Miggy's mom brought home.\n2. Subtract the number of hats Miggy tore off.\n3.
