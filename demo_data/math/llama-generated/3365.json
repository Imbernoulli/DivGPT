        "To determine how much more expensive, per can, the deal at the grocery store is compared to the bulk warehouse, we need to calculate the cost per can for each option and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost per can at the bulk warehouse:\n- The bulk warehouse offers 48 cans for $12.00.\n- To find the cost per can, we divide the total cost by the number of cans:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cost per can at the bulk warehouse} = \\frac{12.00}{48}\n  \\]\n  Simplify the fraction:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cost per can at the bulk warehouse} = \\frac{12.00 \\div 12}{48 \\div 12} = \\frac{1.00}{4} = 0.25 \\text{ dollars per can}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost per can at the grocery store:\n- The grocery store offers 12 cans for $6.00.\n- To find the cost per can, we divide the total cost by the number of cans:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cost per can at the grocery store} = \\frac{6.00}{12}\n  \\]\n  Simplify the fraction:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cost per can at the grocery store} = \\frac{6.00 \\div 6}{12 \\div 6} = \\frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \\text{ dollars per can}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in cost per can between the grocery store and the bulk warehouse:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in cost per can} = 0.50 - 0.25 = 0.25 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSince the question asks for the difference in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):\n\\[\n0.25 \\text{ dollars} = 0.25 \\times 100 = 25 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the deal at the grocery store is \\(\\boxed{25}\\) cents more expensive per can than the deal at the bulk warehouse.",

        "To determine how much more expensive, per can, the deal at the grocery store is compared to the bulk warehouse, we need to calculate the cost per can for each option and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost per can at the bulk warehouse:\n\n1. The bulk warehouse offers 48 cans for $12.00.\n2. To find the cost per can, we divide the total cost by the number of cans:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per can at the bulk warehouse} = \\frac{12.00}{48}\n   \\]\n3. Simplify the division:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12.00}{48} = 0.25 \\text{ dollars per can}\n   \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost per can at the grocery store:\n\n1. The grocery store offers 12 cans for $6.00.\n2. To find the cost per can, we divide the total cost by the number of cans:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per can at the grocery store} = \\frac{6.00}{12}\n   \\]\n3. Simplify the division:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6.00}{12} = 0.50 \\text{ dollars per can}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the difference in cost per can between the grocery store and the bulk warehouse:\n\n1. Subtract the cost per can at the bulk warehouse from the cost per can at the grocery store:\n   \\[\n   0.50 - 0.25 = 0.25 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nFinally, convert the difference from dollars to cents:\n\n1. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents:\n   \\[\n   0.25 \\text{ dollars} = 0.25 \\times 100 = 25 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the deal at the grocery store is \\(\\boxed{25}\\) cents more expensive per can compared to the bulk warehouse.",
