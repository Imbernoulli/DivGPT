Since the 500 ml bottles are currently out of stock at the store, she buys a 2-liter bottle of soda instead. If Dana continues to drink 500 ml of soda each day, how long will the 2-liter bottle of soda last? There are 1,000 ml in 1 liter.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Therefore, 2 liters is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ liters} \\times 1,000 \\text{ ml/liter} = 2,000 \\text{ ml} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate how many days the 2-liter bottle will last.**\n\nDana drinks 500 milliliters of soda each day. To find out how many days the 2,000 milliliters will last, we divide the total volume of the bottle by her daily consumption:\n\\[ 2,000 \\text{ ml} \\div 500 \\text{ ml/day} = 4 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nThus, the 2-liter bottle of soda will last Dana \\(\\boxed{4}\\) days.",
