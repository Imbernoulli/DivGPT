        "To determine the total cost of the entrance tickets for the 4th grade class and the teachers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people going to the science museum.\n2. Determine the cost of the entrance tickets for all the people.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of people. The class consists of 20 students and 3 teachers. So, we add the number of students and the number of teachers together:\n\\[ 20 + 3 = 23 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much it will cost for all 23 people to enter the science museum. Each entrance ticket costs $5. Therefore, we multiply the total number of people by the cost of each ticket:\n\\[ 23 \\times 5 = 115 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost for the entrance tickets is \\(\\boxed{115}\\).",
