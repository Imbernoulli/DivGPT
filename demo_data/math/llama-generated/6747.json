        "To determine how many miles farther Henri drove compared to Gervais, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of miles Gervais drove over the 3 days.\n2. Compare the total miles driven by Henri to the total miles driven by Gervais.\n3. Find the difference between the two totals.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of miles Gervais drove. Gervais drove an average of 315 miles per day for 3 days. Therefore, we multiply the average number of miles per day by the number of days:\n\\[\n315 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 945 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Henri drove a total of 1,250 miles over one week. To find out how many miles farther Henri drove compared to Gervais, we subtract the total miles driven by Gervais from the total miles driven by Henri:\n\\[\n1,250 \\text{ miles} - 945 \\text{ miles} = 305 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThus, Henri drove \\(\\boxed{305}\\) miles farther than Gervais.",
