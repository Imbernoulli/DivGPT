So, in one day, he gets:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ trees/day} \\times 3 \\text{ blocks/tree} = 6 \\text{ blocks/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many blocks of wood he gets after 5 days. Since he gets 6 blocks each day, in 5 days he will get:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ blocks/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 30 \\text{ blocks} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of blocks of wood Ragnar gets after 5 days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",
        "To determine how many blocks of wood Ragnar gets after 5 days, we can break the problem down into smaller steps.\n\n1. First, we calculate how many blocks of wood Ragnar gets from chopping one tree. Since he gets 3 blocks of wood for each tree he cuts, we have:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ blocks/tree}\n   \\]\n\n2.
