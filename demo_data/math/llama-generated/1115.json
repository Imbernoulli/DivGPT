        "To find the average time in seconds for Carlos and Diego, we need to determine the time each would take to complete the race and then calculate the average.\n\nFirst, let's determine Carlos's time to complete the race. Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, Carlos's time in seconds is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's determine Diego's time to complete the race. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes. Since he is tripped by a dog and can't finish, we assume he would keep up the same speed the entire race. Therefore, it would take him twice as long to run around the entire block. So, Diego's time in minutes to complete the race would be:\n\\[\n2.5 \\times 2 = 5 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nConverting this time into seconds, we get:\n\\[\n5 \\times 60 = 300 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the average time for Carlos and Diego. The average time is the sum of their times divided by the number of racers:\n\\[\n\\text{Average time} = \\frac{180 + 300}{2} = \\frac{480}{2} = 240 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nThus, the average time in seconds for the racers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{240}\n\\]",

Since the entire block is twice the distance of half the block, it would take him twice as long to run the entire block:\n\\[ 2.5 \\text{ minutes} \\times 2 = 5 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we convert the times for both Carlos and Diego from minutes to seconds.
