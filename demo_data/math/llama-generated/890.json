        "To determine how much Mary Anne spends on sparkling water every year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of bottles Mary Anne drinks in one year.\n2. Determine the cost of the bottles consumed in one year.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many bottles Mary Anne drinks in one year. Since she drinks \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of a bottle each night and there are 365 days in a year, we can calculate the total number of bottles she drinks in a year by multiplying \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) by 365:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total bottles per year} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 365 = \\frac{365}{5} = 73\n\\]\n\nSo, Mary Anne drinks 73 bottles of sparkling water each year.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these 73 bottles. Since each bottle costs $2.00, we multiply the number of bottles by the cost per bottle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost per year} = 73 \\times 2 = 146\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mary Anne spends \\(\\boxed{146}\\) dollars on sparkling water every year.",
