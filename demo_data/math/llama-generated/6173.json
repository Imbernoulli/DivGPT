        "To determine your current age, let's define your current age as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, you are three times older than you were six years ago. six years ago, your age was \\( x - 6 \\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the relationship between your current age and your age six years ago:\n\n\\[ x = 3(x - 6) \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve this equation step by step. First, expand the right side of the equation by distributing the 3:\n\n\\[ x = 3x - 18 \\]\n\nNow, isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation by subtracting \\( 3x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ x - 3x = -18 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ -2x = -18 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), divide both sides of the equation by -2:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-18}{-2} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ x = 9 \\]\n\nSo, your current age is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
