        "To determine how much James paid per shirt after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discount amount for the total cost.\n2. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the discounted total.\n3. Divide the discounted total by the number of shirts to find the cost per shirt.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the discount amount for the total cost.\n   The original total cost is $60, and the discount is 40%. Therefore, the discount amount is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\times \\frac{40}{100} = 60 \\times 0.40 = 24\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the discounted total.\n   The discounted total is:\n   \\[\n   60 - 24 = 36\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide the discounted total by the number of shirts to find the cost per shirt.\n   James bought 3 shirts, so the cost per shirt is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{3} = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount James paid per shirt after the discount is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",

Subtract the discount amount from the original price per shirt to find the sale price per shirt.\n\nFirst, let's find the original price per shirt. James bought 3 shirts for $60, so the original price per shirt is:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the discount amount. The discount is 40%, so we calculate 40% of the original price per shirt:\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 20 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the discount amount from the original price per shirt to find the sale price per shirt:\n\\[\n20 - 8 = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount James paid per shirt after the discount is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
