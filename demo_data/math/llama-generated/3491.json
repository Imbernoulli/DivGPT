Compute the total cost for five paintings.\n5. Add the total costs from steps 3 and 4.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the new price of each piece of jewelry.**\n\nThe original price of each piece of jewelry is $30. Mr. Rocky increases the price by $10.\n\\[\n30 + 10 = 40\n\\]\nSo, the new price of each piece of jewelry is $40.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the new price of each painting.**\n\nThe original price of each painting is $100. Mr. Rocky increases the price by 20%. To find the increase, we calculate 20% of $100.\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 100 = 20\n\\]\nSo, the increase in price is $20. Adding this to the original price gives:\n\\[\n100 + 20 = 120\n\\]\nSo, the new price of each painting is $120.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the total cost for two pieces of jewelry.**\n\nThe new price of each piece of jewelry is $40. Therefore, the total cost for two pieces is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 40 = 80\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Compute the total cost for five paintings.**\n\nThe new price of each painting is $120. Therefore, the total cost for five paintings is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 120 = 600\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Add the total costs from steps 3 and 4.**\n\nThe total cost for two pieces of jewelry is $80, and the total cost for five paintings is $600. Adding these together gives:\n\\[\n80 + 600 = 680\n\\]\n\nThus, the total price a buyer who takes two pieces of jewelry and five paintings would pay is \\boxed{680}.",
