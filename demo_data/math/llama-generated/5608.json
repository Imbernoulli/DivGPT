        "First, we need to determine how many birthday candles Aniyah has. According to the problem, Aniyah has 6 times as many birthday candles as Ambika. Since Ambika has 4 birthday candles, we can calculate the number of candles Aniyah has as follows:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\]\n\nSo, Aniyah has 24 birthday candles. Next, we need to find out the total number of birthday candles they have together. We do this by adding the number of candles Aniyah has to the number of candles Ambika has:\n\n\\[ 24 + 4 = 28 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many birthday candles they will each have if they share them equally. We do this by dividing the total number of candles by 2:\n\n\\[ 28 \\div 2 = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, if Aniyah and Ambika put their birthday candles together and share them equally, each of them will have \\(\\boxed{14}\\) birthday candles.",

        "To determine how many birthday candles Aniyah and Ambika will each have if they share them equally, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of birthday candles Ambika has.\n2. Calculate the number of birthday candles Aniyah has.\n3. Find the total number of birthday candles by adding the candles Aniyah and Ambika have.\n4. Divide the total number of birthday candles by 2 to find out how many each will have after sharing them equally.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Ambika has 4 birthday candles.\n2. Aniyah has 6 times as many birthday candles as Ambika. Therefore, we calculate the number of candles Aniyah has as follows:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 4 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, Aniyah has 24 birthday candles.\n3. The total number of birthday candles is the sum of the candles Aniyah and Ambika have:\n   \\[\n   4 + 24 = 28\n   \\]\n4. To find out how many each will have after sharing them equally, we divide the total number of candles by 2:\n   \\[\n   28 \\div 2 = 14\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, after sharing the birthday candles equally, each will have \\boxed{14} birthday candles.",
