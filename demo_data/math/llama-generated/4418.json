        "To determine the final volume of the syrup, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the initial volume of the raspberry juice from quarts to cups.\n2. Calculate the reduced volume of the raspberry juice.\n3. Add the volume of the sugar to the reduced volume of the raspberry juice.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the initial volume of the raspberry juice from quarts to cups.**\n\nBilly starts with 6 quarts of raspberry juice. Since there are 4 cups in a quart, we can convert quarts to cups by multiplying by 4:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ quarts} \\times 4 \\text{ cups/quart} = 24 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the reduced volume of the raspberry juice.**\n\nBilly reduces the raspberry juice to \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) of its original volume. So, we multiply the original volume by \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\):\n\\[ 24 \\text{ cups} \\times \\frac{1}{12} = 2 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the volume of the sugar to the reduced volume of the raspberry juice.**\n\nBilly adds 1 cup of sugar to the reduced volume of the raspberry juice. So, we add 1 cup to 2 cups:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ cups} + 1 \\text{ cup} = 3 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nTherefore, the final volume of the syrup is \\(\\boxed{3}\\) cups.",
