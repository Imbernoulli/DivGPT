Add the number of oranges left and the number of apples left to get the total number of fruits left.\n\nLet's start with the oranges:\nTom has 40 oranges and he sold \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of them. So, the number of oranges sold is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of oranges left is:\n\\[\n40 - 10 = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the apples:\nTom has 70 apples and he sold \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of them. So, the number of apples sold is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 70 = 35\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of apples left is:\n\\[\n70 - 35 = 35\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of oranges left and the number of apples left to get the total number of fruits left:\n\\[\n30 + 35 = 65\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of fruits left is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{65}\n\\]"
