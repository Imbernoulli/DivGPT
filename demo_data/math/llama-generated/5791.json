        "To determine the total number of bills Samuel has in his wallet, we need to find out how many $5-bills, $10-bills, and $20-bills he has. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the value of the $10-bills:**\n   Samuel's $10-bills amount to $50. Since each $10-bill is worth $10, we can calculate the number of $10-bills as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of $10-bills} = \\frac{50}{10} = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the value of the $20-bills:**\n   Samuel has 4 $20-bills. Since each $20-bill is worth $20, the total value of the $20-bills is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total value of $20-bills} = 4 \\times 20 = 80\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the value of the $5-bills:**\n   The total amount of money in Samuel's wallet is $150. We already know the value of the $10-bills and the $20-bills, so we can find the value of the $5-bills by subtracting the value of the $10-bills and the $20-bills from the total amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value of $5-bills} = 150 - 50 - 80 = 20\n   \\]\n   Since each $5-bill is worth $5, the number of $5-bills is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of $5-bills} = \\frac{20}{5} = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of bills:**\n   Now that we know the number of each type of bill, we can find the total number of bills by adding the number of $5-bills, $10-bills, and $20-bills:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of bills} = 4 + 5 + 4 = 13\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of bills Samuel has in his wallet is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of bills Samuel has in his wallet, we need to analyze the information given step by step.\n\n1. **Total amount of money in the wallet:**\n   Samuel has $150 in total.\n\n2. **Amount of money in $10-bills:**\n   Samuel's $10-bills amount to $50. Since each $10-bill is worth $10, the number of $10-bills is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50}{10} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, Samuel has 5 $10-bills.\n\n3. **Amount of money in $20-bills:**\n   Samuel has 4 $20-bills. Since each $20-bill is worth $20, the total amount of money in $20-bills is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 20 = 80\n   \\]\n\n4. **Amount of money in $5-bills:**\n   Let the number of $5-bills be \\( x \\). The total amount of money in $5-bills is \\( 5x \\). According to the problem, the sum of the amounts of money in $5-bills, $10-bills, and $20-bills is $150. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   5x + 50 + 80 = 150\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   5x + 130 = 150\n   \\]\n   Subtracting 130 from both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   5x = 20\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 5, we get:\n   \\[\n   x = 4\n   \\]\n   So, Samuel has 4 $5-bills.\n\n5. **Total number of bills:**\n   The total number of bills is the sum of the number of $5-bills, $10-bills, and $20-bills:\n   \\[\n   4 + 5 + 4 = 13\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of bills Samuel has in his wallet is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of bills Samuel has in his wallet, we need to analyze the information given step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the value of the $20-bills:**\n   Samuel has 4 $20-bills.

We know the value of the $20-bills and the $10-bills, so we can find the value of the $5-bills by subtracting the value of the $20-bills and the $10-bills from the total amount:\n   \\[\n   150 - 80 - 50 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Since each $5-bill is worth $5, the number of $5-bills is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{5} = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of bills:**\n   Samuel has 4 $20-bills, 5 $10-bills, and 4 $5-bills.

We know the total value of the $10-bills is $50 and the total value of the $20-bills is $80. Therefore, the value of the $5-bills can be found by subtracting the value of the $10-bills and $20-bills from the total amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value of $5-bills} = 150 - 50 - 80 = 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of $5-bills:**\n   Since each $5-bill is worth $5, we can find the number of $5-bills by dividing the total value by the value of each bill:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of $5-bills} = \\frac{20}{5} = 4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of bills:**\n   Now, we add up the number of $5-bills, $10-bills, and $20-bills:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of bills} = 4 \\text{ (5-bills)} + 5 \\text{ (10-bills)} + 4 \\text{ (20-bills)} = 13\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of bills Samuel has in his wallet is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of bills Samuel has in his wallet, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of $10-bills:**\n   Samuel's $10-bills amount to $50. Since each $10-bill is worth $10, we can find the number of $10-bills by dividing $50 by $10:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50}{10} = 5\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Samuel has 5 $10-bills.\n\n2. **Determine the value of the $20-bills:**\n   Samuel has 4 $20-bills.

Let \\( x \\) be the number of $5 bills, \\( y \\) be the number of $10 bills, and \\( z \\) be the number of $20 bills. According to the problem, we know the following:\n\n1. The total amount of money Samuel has is $150.\n2. The total amount of money from the $10 bills is $50.\n3. Samuel has 4 $20 bills.\n\nFrom the second piece of information, we can determine the number of $10 bills:\n\\[ y \\times 10 = 50 \\implies y = 5. \\]\n\nFrom the third piece of information, we know:\n\\[ z = 4. \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) into the first equation, which represents the total amount of money:\n\\[ 5x + 10y + 20z = 150. \\]\nSubstituting \\( y = 5 \\) and \\( z = 4 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 5x + 10(5) + 20(4) = 150. \\]\nSimplifying the right side, we have:\n\\[ 5x + 50 + 80 = 150. \\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 5x + 130 = 150. \\]\nSubtracting 130 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ 5x = 20. \\]\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\\[ x = 4. \\]\n\nSo, Samuel has 4 $5 bills, 5 $10 bills, and 4 $20 bills. To find the total number of bills, we add these amounts together:\n\\[ x + y + z = 4 + 5 + 4 = 13. \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of bills Samuel has in his wallet is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",
