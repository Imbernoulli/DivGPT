        "To determine the total number of toy cars made by the factory over the two days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of cars made yesterday.\n2. Calculate the number of cars made today.\n3. Add the number of cars made yesterday to the number of cars made today.\n\nFirst, we know that the factory made 60 cars yesterday.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cars were made today. According to the problem, the factory made twice the number of cars today than it did yesterday. Therefore, we calculate the number of cars made today as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of cars made yesterday to the number of cars made today to find the total number of cars made over the two days:\n\\[ 60 + 120 = 180 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of toy cars made by the factory is \\(\\boxed{180}\\).",

To find the total number of cars made over the two days, we add the number of cars made yesterday to the number of cars made today:\n   \\[\n   60 + 120 = 180\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of toy cars made by the factory is \\(\\boxed{180}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of toy cars made by the factory over the two days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of cars made yesterday. According to the problem, the factory made 60 cars yesterday.\n2. Calculate the number of cars made today. The problem states that the factory made twice the number of cars today than it did yesterday. Therefore, we multiply the number of cars made yesterday by 2:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 60 = 120\n   \\]\n   So, the factory made 120 cars today.\n3. Add the number of cars made yesterday to the number of cars made today to find the total number of cars made over the two days:\n   \\[\n   60 + 120 = 180\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of toy cars made by the factory is \\boxed{180}.",

The problem states that the factory made twice the number of cars than it did yesterday. Therefore, we multiply the number of cars made yesterday by 2:\n\\[ 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\]\nSo, the factory made 120 cars today.\n\nNow, we add the number of cars made yesterday to the number of cars made today to find the total number of cars made over the two days:\n\\[ 60 + 120 = 180 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of toy cars made by the factory is \\(\\boxed{180}\\).",
