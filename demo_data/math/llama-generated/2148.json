        "To determine how many pieces of fruit Mark ate in the first four days of the week, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total Pieces of Fruit at thebeginning of the Week:**\n   Mark starts with 10 pieces of fruit.\n\n2. **Pieces of Fruit Kept for Next Week:**\n   On Friday, Mark decides to keep 2 pieces of fruit for next week. Therefore, the number of pieces of fruit he keeps is:\n   \\[\n   2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Pieces of Fruit Brought to School on Friday:**\n   Mark brings 3 pieces of fruit to school on Friday. Therefore, the number of pieces of fruit he brings to school on Friday is:\n   \\[\n   3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Pieces of Fruit Used on Friday:**\n   The total number of pieces of fruit used on Friday is the sum of the pieces he keeps and the pieces he brings to school:\n   \\[\n   2 + 3 = 5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Pieces of Fruit尻 used in the First Four Days:**\n   Since Mark started with 10 pieces of fruit and used 5 pieces on Friday, the number of pieces of fruit he had left after Friday is:\n   \\[\n   10 - 1(\" = 5\n   \\]\n   These remaining pieces were eaten in the first four days.\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of fruit Mark ate in the first four days of the week is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",

Start with the total number of pieces of fruit Mark had initially, which is 10.\n2. Mark decided to keep 2 pieces of fruit for next week. So, we subtract these 2 pieces from the total:\n   \\[\n   10 - 2 = 8\n   \\]\n   Now Mark has 8 pieces of fruit left.\n3. On Friday, Mark brings 3 pieces of fruit to school. So, we subtract these 3 pieces from the remaining 8 pieces:\n   \\[\n   8 - 3 = 5\n   \\]\n   Now Mark has 5 pieces of fruit left for the first four days of the week.\n4.

        "To determine how many pieces of fruit Mark ate in the first four days of the week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the total number of pieces of fruit Mark had at the beginning of the week, which is 10 pieces.\n2.

This gives us the number of pieces of fruit he had left after setting aside 2 pieces.\n   \\[\n   10 - 2 = 8\n   \\]\n3. Subtract the number of pieces of fruit Mark brought to school on Friday, which is 3 pieces.

On Friday, he decided to keep 2 pieces of fruit for next week.\n3. On Friday, he brought 3 pieces of fruit to school.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pieces of fruit Mark used on Friday:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ (kept for next week)} + 3 \\text{ (brought to school)} = 5 \\text{ pieces of fruit} \\]\n\nSince Mark used 5 pieces of fruit on Friday, we subtract this from the initial number of pieces of fruit to find out how many pieces he had left before Friday:\n\\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \\text{ pieces of fruit} \\]\n\nThe 5 pieces of fruit left before Friday were eaten in the first four days of the week.
