        "To determine the total wait time for John to get both doses of the COVID vaccine, we need to calculate the wait time for each dose and then sum these times.\n\n1. **First Dose:**\n   - The wait time for the first dose is given as 20 minutes.\n\n2. **Second Dose:**\n   - The wait time for the second dose is half as long as the first dose.\n   - Therefore, we calculate the wait time for the second dose as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Wait time for second dose} = \\frac{20 \\text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Wait Time:**\n   - To find the total wait time, we add the wait time for the first dose and the wait time for the second dose:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total wait time} = 20 \\text{ minutes} + 10 \\text{ minutes} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total wait time for John to get both doses of the COVID vaccine is \\boxed{30} minutes.",
