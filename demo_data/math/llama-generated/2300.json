        "To determine the total cost Tom will incur for hiring an assistant to help him cross the lake back and forth, we need to consider the time taken for each crossing and the hourly wage of the assistant.\n\nFirst, we know that crossing the lake in one direction takes 4 hours. Since Tom needs to cross the lake back and forth, the total time spent crossing the lake is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ hours} + 4 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we know that hiring an assistant costs $10 per hour. Therefore, the total cost for hiring the assistant for 8 hours is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ hours} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 80 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Tom would have to pay for help with crossing the lake back and forth is:\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]",

Determine the total cost for the round trip.\n\nFirst, we know that it takes Tom 4 hours to cross the lake in one direction. Since he needs an assistant for each crossing, the cost for one crossing is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$10 \\text{ per hour} = \\$40 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total time for a round trip. Since each crossing takes 4 hours, the total time for a round trip is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ hours} + 4 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we determine the total cost for the round trip. Since the cost for one crossing is \\$40, the cost for a round trip is:\n\\[ 2 \\times \\$40 = \\$80 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Tom would have to pay for help with crossing the lake back and forth is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{80}\n\\]",

Determine the total cost for the round trip.\n\nStep 1: The time it takes to cross the lake in one direction is 4 hours.\n\nStep 2: The cost of hiring an assistant for one direction is $10 per hour. Therefore, the cost for one direction is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ hours} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 40 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nStep 3: The total time for a round trip is the time for one direction plus the time for the return direction.
