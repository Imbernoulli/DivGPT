He makes a salad out of lettuce (50 calories), carrots (twice the calories of the lettuce) and dressing (210 calories). He also makes a pizza with 600 calories for the crust, 1/3 the crust's calories for the pepperoni, and 400 calories for the cheese. If Jackson eats 1/4 of the salad and 1/5 of the pizza, how many calories does he eat?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "First, let's determine the total calories in the salad.
