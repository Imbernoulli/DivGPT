        "To determine the total time Andrew takes to travel from Manhattan to the Bronx, we need to add up the time he spends on each mode of transportation: the subway, the train, and biking.\n\n1. **Subway Ride:**\n   Andrew rides the subway for 10 hours.\n\n2. **Train Ride:**\n   Andrew rides the train for twice as much time as he rides the subway. Therefore, we calculate the train ride time as follows:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 10 \\text{ hours} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Biking:**\n   Andrew bikes for 8 hours.\n\nNext, we sum up the time spent on each mode of transportation:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ hours (subway)} + 20 \\text{ hours (train)} + 8 \\text{ hours (biking)}\n\\]\n\nAdding these times together:\n\\[\n10 + 20 + 8 = 38 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time Andrew takes to reach the Bronx from Manhattan is \\boxed{38} hours.",
