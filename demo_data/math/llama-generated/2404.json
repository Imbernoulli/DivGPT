        "To determine the current cost of a lawnmower, we start by using the information given: a year ago, the total cost of buying a lawnmower was \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times less than the cost it goes for now. This means that the cost a year ago was \\(\\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{5}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{5}} = \\frac{5}{7}\\) of the current cost.\n\nLet's denote the current cost of a lawnmower as \\(C\\). According to the problem, the cost a year ago was $1800. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{7}C = 1800\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(C\\), we need to solve for \\(C\\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\), which is \\(\\frac{7}{5}\\):\n\\[\nC = 1800 \\times \\frac{7}{5} = 1800 \\times 1.4 = 2520\n\\]\n\nSo, the current cost of one lawnmower is $2520. To find out how much it would cost Mr. Lucian to buy 4 such lawnmowers, we multiply the current cost by 4:\n\\[\n4 \\times 2520 = 10080\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost for Mr. Lucian to buy 4 lawnmowers is \\(\\boxed{10080}\\).",
        "To determine the current cost of a lawnmower, we start by noting that the cost a year ago was $1800 and that this cost was \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times less than the current cost. This means that the cost a year ago was \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\) of the current cost. Let's denote the current cost of a lawnmower as \\(x\\). According to the problem, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[1800 = \\frac{5}{7}x\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we need to solve for \\(x\\) by isolating it on one side of the equation.
