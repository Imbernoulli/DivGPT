        "To determine how many muffins Janet bought, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much Janet spent on muffins.\n2. Determine the number of muffins based on the cost per muffin.\n\nFirst, we know that Janet paid $20 and got $11 in change back. Therefore, the amount of money she spent on muffins is:\n\\[ 20 - 11 = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince each muffin costs 75 cents, we need to convert the amount spent into cents to make the calculation easier. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ dollars} = 9 \\times 100 = 900 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNext, we divide the total amount spent in cents by the cost per muffin to find out how many muffins Janet bought:\n\\[ 900 \\div 75 = 12 \\]\n\nSo, Janet bought \\(\\boxed{12}\\) muffins.",
