        "To determine how many friends James has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of friends James had.\n2. Subtract the number of friends he got into an argument with and no longer considers friends.\n3. Add the number of new friends he made on his way back home.\n\nLet's go through the steps in detail:\n\n1. James initially had 20 friends.\n2. He got into an argument with 2 friends and no longer considers them friends. So, we subtract 2 from 20:\n   \\[\n   20 - 2 = 18\n   \\]\n3. On his way back home, he made 1 new friend. So, we add 1 to 18:\n   \\[\n   18 + 1 = 19\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of friends James has left is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).",
