Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much milk all the cows produce in one day. The farmer has 52 cows, and each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day. So, the total milk production in one day is:\n\\[ 52 \\text{ cows} \\times 5 \\text{ liters/cow} = 260 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much milk is produced in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total milk production in a week is:\n\\[ 260 \\text{ liters/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 1820 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the farmer gets \\(\\boxed{1820}\\) liters of milk in a week.",
