        "To determine the total quantity of apples Adam bought over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples he bought each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we find out how many apples Adam bought on Tuesday. Since he bought 3 times the quantity he bought on Monday, and he bought 15 apples on Monday, we calculate:\n\\[\n3 \\times 15 = 45\n\\]\nSo, Adam bought 45 apples on Tuesday.\n\nNext, we find out how many apples Adam bought on Wednesday. Since he bought 4 times the quantity he bought on Tuesday, and he bought 45 apples on Tuesday, we calculate:\n\\[\n4 \\times 45 = 180\n\\]\nSo, Adam bought 180 apples on Wednesday.\n\nNow, we sum up the apples bought on all three days:\n\\[\n15 + 45 + 180 = 240\n\\]\nTherefore, the total quantity of apples Adam bought on these three days is \\boxed{240}.",
