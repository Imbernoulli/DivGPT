        "To determine how many laps Jeff had remaining when he took the break, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of laps Jeff swam on Saturday and Sunday morning:**\n   - On Saturday, Jeff swam 27 laps.\n   - On Sunday morning, Jeff swam 15 laps.\n   - Adding these together:\n     \\[\n     27 \\text{ laps} + 15 \\text{ laps} = 42 \\text{ laps}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the total number of laps swum from the required number of laps:**\n   - Jeff was required to swim 98 laps over the weekend.\n   - He swam 42 laps by the end of Sunday morning.\n   - Subtracting these:\n     \\[\n     98 \\text{ laps} - 42 \\text{ laps} = 56 \\text{ laps}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of laps Jeff had remaining when he took the break is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",
        "To determine how many laps Jeff had remaining when he took his break on Sunday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of laps Jeff swam on Saturday.\n2. Add the number of laps Jeff swam on Sunday morning to the laps swum on Saturday.\n3. Subtract the total number of laps swum by the end of Sunday morning from the total number of laps required.\n\nFirst, we know that Jeff swam 27 laps on Saturday. Next, on Sunday morning, he swam 15 laps. So, we add the laps swum on Saturday to the laps swum on Sunday morning:\n\n\\[ 27 + 15 = 42 \\]\n\nThis means that by the end of Sunday morning, Jeff had swum a total of 42 laps. The coach required him to swim 98 laps over the weekend. Therefore, we subtract the total number of laps swum by the end of Sunday morning from the total number of laps required:\n\n\\[ 98 - 42 = 56 \\]\n\nSo, the number of laps Jeff had remaining when he took the break is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",

Jeff swam 27 laps on Saturday.\n\nNext, we add the number of laps he swam on Sunday morning to the laps swum on Saturday. Jeff swam 15 laps on Sunday morning. So, we have:\n\\[ 27 + 15 = 42 \\]\nThis means Jeff swam a total of 42 laps by the end of Sunday morning.\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of laps swum by the end of Sunday morning from the required total number of laps. Jeff was required to swim 98 laps over the weekend. So, we have:\n\\[ 98 - 42 = 56 \\]\nThis means Jeff had 56 laps remaining when he took his break on Sunday.\n\nTherefore, the number of laps Jeff had remaining when he took the break is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",
