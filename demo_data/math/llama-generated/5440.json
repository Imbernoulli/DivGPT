        "To determine the total cost Harry needs to pay for 14 balloons, we should consider the pricing options: buying individual balloons at $0.5 each or buying packs of 10 balloons for $3 each.

        "To determine the total cost for Harry to buy exactly 14 balloons, we need to consider the pricing options: single balloons cost $0.5 each, and packs of 10 balloons cost $3 each. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of one pack of 10 balloons:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one pack} = \\$3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many packs and single balloons Harry needs:**\n   - Harry wants 14 balloons.\n   - Each pack contains 10 balloons.\n   - Therefore, he can buy one pack of 10 balloons and then 4 single balloons.\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the single balloons:**\n   - Each single balloon costs $0.5.\n   - Harry needs 4 single balloons.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of 4 single balloons} = 4 \\times \\$0.5 = \\$2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   - Cost of one pack of 10 balloons = \\$3\n   - Cost of 4 single balloons = \\$2\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\$3 + \\$2 = \\$5\n   \\]\n\nThus, Harry needs to pay \\(\\boxed{5}\\) dollars for 14 balloons.",
        "To determine the total cost for Harry to buy 14 balloons, we should first consider the cost of buying balloons in packs versus buying them individually. Since a pack of 10 balloons costs $3 and each individual balloon costs $0.5, it is cheaper to buy one pack of 10 balloons and then buy the remaining 4 balloons individually.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of one pack of 10 balloons:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ pack} \\times \\$3/\\text{pack} = \\$3\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the remaining 4 balloons:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ balloons} \\times \\$0.5/\\text{balloon} = \\$2\n   \\]\n\n3. Add the cost of the pack of 10 balloons and the cost of the 4 individual balloons to find the total cost:\n   \\[\n   \\$3 + \\$2 = \\$5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Harry needed to pay for 14 balloons is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

individual balloons is $0.5 * 4 = $2.\n- Therefore, the total cost is $3 + $2 = $5.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost if Harry buys two packs of 5 balloons (which is not possible since he cannot buy a

        "To determine the total cost Harry paid for 14 balloons, we need to consider the pricing options: buying individual balloons at $0.5 each or buying packs of 10 balloons for $3 each.
