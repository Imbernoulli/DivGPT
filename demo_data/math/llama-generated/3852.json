        "To determine the total number of candies that Rubert, James, and Adam have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many candies James has.\n2. Find out how many candies Rubert has.\n3. Add the number of candies each person has to get the total.\n\nFirst, we know that Adam has 6 candies. James has 3 times the number of candies Adam has. Therefore, we calculate the number of candies James has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of candies James has} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of candies Adam has} = 3 \\times 6 = 18\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Rubert has 4 times the number of candies James has. Therefore, we calculate the number of candies Rubert has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of candies Rubert has} = 4 \\times \\text{Number of candies James has} = 4 \\times 18 = 72\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of candies each person has to find the total number of candies:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of candies} = \\text{Number of candies Adam has} + \\text{Number of candies James has} + \\text{Number of candies Rubert has} = 6 + 18 + 72 = 96\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of candies that Rubert, James, and Adam have is \\boxed{96}.",
