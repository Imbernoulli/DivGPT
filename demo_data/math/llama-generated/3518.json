Calculate how many more ounces of rum Don can have without exceeding his maximum daily limit.\n\nFirst, we calculate the maximum amount of rum Don can consume in a day. Don can consume a maximum of 3 times the amount of rum Sally Draper gave him. Since Sally gave Don 10oz of rum, we multiply 10oz by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ oz}\n\\]\nSo, Don can consume a maximum of 30oz of rum in a day.\n\nNext, we determine the total amount of rum Don has already consumed. Don already had 12oz of rum earlier that day and then he consumed 10oz of rum on his pancakes. Therefore, we add these two amounts together:\n\\[\n12 + 10 = 22 \\text{ oz}\n\\]\nSo, Don has already consumed 22oz of rum.\n\nFinally, we calculate how many more ounces of rum Don can have without exceeding his maximum daily limit. We subtract the amount of rum Don has already consumed from his maximum daily limit:\n\\[\n30 - 22 = 8 \\text{ oz}\n\\]\nSo, Don can have \\boxed{8} more ounces of rum after eating all of the rum on his pancakes.",
