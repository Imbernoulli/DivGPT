        "To determine the total number of hours Jeff spends working in an entire week, we need to break down his schedule into two parts: the weekend and the weekdays.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of hours Jeff spends working on the weekend. Jeff spends 3 hours each day catching up with his Facebook pals. Therefore, over the weekend (which consists of 2 days), he spends:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 6 \\text{ hours} \\]\nSince Jeff spends three times as many hours on the weekend catching up with his Facebook pals as he does working, the number of hours he spends working on the weekend is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ hours} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of hours Jeff spends working on the weekdays. Jeff spends 3 hours each day catching up with his Facebook_palms. Therefore, over the weekdays (which consist of 5 days), he spends:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 15 \\text{ hours} \\]\nSince Jeff spends four times as many hours working as he does catching up on the weekdays, the number of hours he spends working on the weekdays is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ hours} \\times 4 = 60 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of hours Jeff spends working on the weekend and the weekdays to get the total number of hours he spends working in an entire week:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} + 60 \\text{ hours} = 62 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Jeff spends working in an entire week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{62} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of hours Jeff spends working in an entire week, we need to break down his activities into two parts: the weekend and the weekdays.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of hours Jeff spends catching up with his Facebook pals in a week. Since he spends 3 hours every day catching up, we can multiply the number of hours per day by the number of days in a week:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 21 \\text{ hours/week}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many hours Jeff spends working on the weekend. According to the problem, he spends three times as many hours on the weekend catching up with his Facebook pals as he does working. Since he spends 21 hours in total catching up in a week, and this includes both the weekend and the weekdays, we need to determine how many hours he spends catching up on each part.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of hours Jeff spends catching up on the weekdays. Since he spends 3 hours every day from Monday to Friday, we can multiply the number of hours per day by the number of days he works:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 15 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract the number of hours spent catching up on the weekdays from the total number of hours spent catching up in a week to find the number of hours spent catching up on the weekend:\n\\[\n21 \\text{ hours} - 15 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSince Jeff spends three times as many hours on the weekend catching up with his Facebook pals as he does working, we can set up the following equation to find the number of hours he spends working on the weekend:\n\\[\n\\text{Hours working on the weekend} = \\frac{\\text{Hours catching up on the weekend}}{3} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of hours Jeff spends working on the weekdays. According to the problem, he spends four times as many hours working as he does catching up. Since he spends 3 hours every day from Monday to Friday, we can multiply the number of hours per day by the number不起atar David he works:\n\\[\n4 \\times 3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 4 \\times 15 = 60 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, add the number of hours spent working on the weekend to the number of hours spent working on the weekdays to find the total number of hours Jeff

According to the problem, Jeff spends three times as many hours on the weekend catching up with his Facebook pals as he does working. Since he spends 3 hours each day catching up on the weekend, over the two days of the weekend, he spends:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of hours he spends working on the weekend is:\n\\[\n\\frac{6 \\text{ hours}}{3} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of hours Jeff spends working on the weekdays. According to the problem, Jeff spends four times as many hours working as he does catching up. Since he spends 3 hours each day catching up on the weekdays, over the five days of the weekdays, he spends:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 15 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of hours he spends working on the weekdays is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 15 \\text{ hours} = 60 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's find the total number of hours Jeff spends working in an entire week by adding the hours he spends working on the weekend and the weekdays:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ hours} + 60 \\text{ hours} = 62 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Jeff spends working in an entire week is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{62}\n\\]",

Since there are 5 days in the weekdays, we have:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 15 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nGiven that Jeff spends four times as many hours working as he does catching up on the weekdays, we can find the number of hours he spends working on the weekdays by multiplying the weekday catching up hours by 4:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ hours} \\times 4 = 60 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, to find the total number of hours Jeff spends working in an entire week, we add the hours he spends working on the weekend and the hours he spends working on the weekdays:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} + 60 \\text{ hours} = 62 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Jeff spends working in an entire week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{62} \\]",

Since he spends 3 hours each day catching up, over the weekend he spends:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 6 \\text{ hours} \\]\nSo, the number of hours he spends working on the weekend is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ hours} \\div 3 = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of hours Jeff spends working on the weekdays.
