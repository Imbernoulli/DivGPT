        "To determine the total number of sandwiches made by Billy, Katelyn, and Chloe, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of sandwiches Katelyn made.\n2. Calculate the number of sandwiches Chloe made.\n3. Add the number of sandwiches made by Billy, Katelyn, and Chloe together.\n\nFirst, we know that Billy made 49 sandwiches. Katelyn made 47 more sandwiches than Billy. Therefore, the number of sandwiches Katelyn made is:\n\\[ 49 + 47 = 96 \\]\n\nNext, Chloe made a quarter of the amount that Katelyn made.
