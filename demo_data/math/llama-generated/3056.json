        "To determine the total amount Darla needs to pay, we will break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the electricity and the late fee.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of the electricity. Darla pays $4 per watt and she uses 300 watts of electricity. Therefore, the cost of the electricity is:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ dollars/watt} \\times 300 \\text{ watts} = 1200 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the late fee to the cost of the electricity. The late fee is $150.
