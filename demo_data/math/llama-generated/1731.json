Divide the combined cost of the two remaining puppies by 2 to find the cost of each one.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The cost of each of the three puppies on sale is $150. Therefore, the total cost of the three puppies is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 150 = 450\n   \\]\n\n2. The total cost of all five puppies is $800. Subtract the total cost of the three puppies from the total cost of all five puppies to find the combined cost of the two remaining puppies:\n   \\[\n   800 - 450 = 350\n   \\]\n\n3. The combined cost of the two remaining puppies is $350. Since the two puppies cost the same, we divide the combined cost by 2 to find the cost of each one:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{350}{2} = 175\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of each of the two other puppies is \\(\\boxed{175}\\).",
