        "To determine how many square tables are needed so that 90 pupils can read at the same time in a library with 7 rectangular tables, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the seating capacity of the rectangular tables:**\n   Each rectangular table seats 10 pupils. Since there are 7 rectangular tables, the total number of pupils that can be seated at the rectangular tables is:\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 10 = 70\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of pupils that still need to be seated:**\n   The total number of pupils is 90. After seating 70 pupils at the rectangular tables, the number of pupils that still need to be seated is:\n   \\[\n   90 - 70 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of square tables needed:**\n   Each square table seats 4 pupils. To find out how many square tables are needed to seat the remaining 20 pupils, we divide the number of remaining pupils by the seating capacity of one square table:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of square tables needed is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine how many square tables are needed so that 90 pupils can read at the same time, we start by calculating the number of pupils that can be seated at the 7 rectangular tables.

Calculate the number of square tables required to seat the remaining pupils.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pupils that can be seated at the rectangular tables.**\n\nThe library has 7 rectangular tables, and each rectangular table seats 10 pupils.\n\\[\n7 \\text{ tables} \\times 10 \\text{ pupils/table} = 70 \\text{ pupils}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many more pupils need to be seated after accounting for the rectangular tables.**\n\nThe total number of pupils that need to be seated is 90. After seating 70 pupils at the rectangular tables, the remaining number of pupils is:\n\\[\n90 \\text{ pupils} - 70 \\text{ pupils} = 20 \\text{ pupils}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of square tables required to seat the remaining pupils.**\n\nEach square table seats 4 pupils. To find out how many square tables are needed to seat 20 pupils, we divide the number of remaining pupils by the number of pupils each square table can seat:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ pupils} \\div 4 \\text{ pupils/table} = 5 \\text{ tables}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of square tables needed is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine how many square tables are needed so that 90 pupils can read at the same time in a library that already has 7 rectangular tables, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pupils that can be seated at the 7 rectangular tables.\n2. Subtract the number of pupils seated at the rectangular tables from the total number of pupils to find out how many more pupils need to be seated.\n3. Determine how many square tables are required to seat the remaining pupils.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\nEach rectangular table seats 10 pupils. Therefore, the total number of pupils that can be seated at 7 rectangular tables is:\n\\[ 7 \\times 10 = 70 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of pupils seated at the rectangular tables from the total number of pupils to find out how many more pupils need to be seated:\n\\[ 90 - 70 = 20 \\]\n\nEach square table seats 4 pupils. Therefore, the number of square tables needed to seat the remaining 20 pupils is:\n\\[ \\frac{20}{4} = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the number of square tables needed is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."
