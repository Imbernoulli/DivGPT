        "To determine how much money Teal makes from her sales, we need to calculate the total revenue from both the pumpkin pie and the custard pie separately and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the revenue from the pumpkin pie:\n1. Each pumpkin pie is cut into 8 pieces.\n2. Teal sells 4 pumpkin pies.\n3. Therefore, the total number of pumpkin pie slices sold is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ pies} \\times 8 \\text{ slices per pie} = 32 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n4. Each slice of pumpkin pie costs $5.\n5. Therefore, the total revenue from the pumpkin pie is:\n   \\[\n   32 \\text{ slices} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars per slice} = 160 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from the custard pie:\n1. Each custard pie is cut into 6 pieces.\n2. Teal sells 5 custard pies.\n3. Therefore, the total number of custard pie slices sold is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ pies} \\times 6 \\text{ slices per pie} = 30 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n4. Each slice of custard pie costs $6.\n5. Therefore, the total revenue from the custard pie is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ slices} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars per slice} = 180 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the revenues from both the pumpkin pie and the custard pie to find the total revenue:\n\\[\n160 \\text{ dollars} + 180 \\text{ dollars} = 340 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Teal makes from her sales is \\(\\boxed{340}\\).",

        "To determine how much money Teal makes from her sales, we need to calculate the total revenue from both the pumpkin pie and the custard pie separately and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the revenue from the pumpkin pie:\n1. Each pumpkin pie is cut into 8 pieces.\n2. Teal sells 4 pumpkin pies.\n3. Therefore, the total number of pumpkin pie slices is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ pies} \\times 8 \\text{ slices per pie} = 32 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n4. Each slice of pumpkin pie costs $5.\n5. Therefore, the total revenue from the pumpkin pie is:\n   \\[\n   32 \\text{ slices} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars per slice} = 160 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from the custard pie:\n1. Each custard pie is cut into 6 pieces.\n2. Teal sells 5 custard pies.\n3. Therefore, the total number of custard pie slices is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ pies} \\times 6 \\text{ slices per pie} = 30 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n4. Each slice of custard pie costs $6.\n5. Therefore, the total revenue from the custard pie is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ slices} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars per slice} = 180 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the revenues from both types of pie to find the total revenue:\n\\[\n160 \\text{ dollars} + 180 \\text{ dollars} = 340 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Teal makes from her sales is \\(\\boxed{340}\\).",
