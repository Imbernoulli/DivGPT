When he started planning the project, the necessary lumber cost $450, the nails cost $30, and the fabric cost $80.  However, recent economic inflation has caused the price of lumber to increase by 20%, the price of nails to increase by 10%, and the price of fabric to increase by 5%.  In dollars, how much more money will it cost to complete the project now (after inflation) than it would have when the father began planning?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The increase in cost is:\n\\[ 450 \\times 0.20 = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the increased cost of the nails. The original cost of the nails is $30, and it has increased by 10%. The increase in cost is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 0.10 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the increased cost of the fabric. The original cost of the fabric is $80, and it has increased by 5%.
