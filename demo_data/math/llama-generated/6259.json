        "To determine Kirill's height, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:\n\n- Let \\( K \\) be Kirill's height in centimeters.\n- Let \\( B \\) be his brother's height in centimeters.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. Kirill is 14 less centimeters in height than his brother. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   K = B - 14\n   \\]\n2. Together their heights equal 112 centimeters. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   K + B = 112\n   \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for \\( K \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[\n(B - 14) + B = 112\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms:\n\\[\n2B - 14 = 112\n\\]\n\nThen, we add 14 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( B \\):\n\\[\n2B = 126\n\\]\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( B \\):\n\\[\nB = 63\n\\]\n\nSo, Kirill's brother is 63 centimeters tall.
