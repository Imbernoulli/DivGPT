        "To determine how many brownies were left, we need to calculate the total number of brownies consumed and subtract that from the original number of brownies.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of brownies Tina ate.

So, the total number of brownies Tina ate is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ (lunch)} + 1 \\text{ (dinner)} = 2 \\text{ brownies per day} \\]\n\\[ 2 \\text{ brownies per day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 10 \\text{ brownies} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of brownies her husband ate.
