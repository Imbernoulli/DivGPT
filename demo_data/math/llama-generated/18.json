        "To determine how many nickels Ray has left after giving some to Peter and Randi, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of money Ray gives away:**\n   - Ray gives 25 cents to Peter.\n   - Ray gives twice as many cents to Randi as he gave to Peter. Therefore, he gives \\(2 \\times 25 = 50\\) cents to Randi.\n   - The total amount of money given away is \\(25 + 50 = 75\\) cents.\n\n2. **Determine how much money Ray has left:**\n   - Ray initially has 95 cents.\n   - After giving away 75 cents, he has \\(95 - 75 = 20\\) cents left.\n\n3. **Convert the remaining amount of money into nickels:**\n   - Since each nickel is worth 5 cents, the number of nickels Ray has left is \\(20 \\div 5 = 4\\).\n\nThus, the number of nickels Ray has left is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
        "First, we need to determine the number of nickels Ray initially has. Since each nickel is worth 5 cents, and Ray has 95 cents in nickels, we can calculate the number of nickels by dividing 95 by 5:\n\\[\n\\frac{95}{5} = 19\n\\]\nSo, Ray initially has 19 nickels.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many cents Ray gives to Peter and Randi. Ray gives 25 cents to Peter and twice as many cents to Randi. Since twice as many cents as 25 is 50, Ray gives 50 cents to Randi. The total number of cents given away is:\n\\[\n25 + 50 = 75\n\\]\nSince each nickel is worth 5 cents, the total number of nickels given away is:\n\\[\n\\frac{75}{5} = 15\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of nickels Ray has left is:\n\\[\n19 - 15 = 4\n\\]\nSo, the number of nickels Ray has left is \\boxed{4}.",
