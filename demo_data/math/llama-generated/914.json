        "Let's denote the number of hoodies Fiona owns as \\( F \\). According to the problem, Casey owns two more hoodies than Fiona, so Casey owns \\( F + 2 \\) hoodies. The total number of hoodies they own together is 8. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ F + (F + 2) = 8 \\]\n\nSimplify the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2F + 2 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, isolate the term with \\( F \\) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2F = 6 \\]\n\nThen, solve for \\( F \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ F = 3 \\]\n\nSo, Fiona owns \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hoodies.",

Casey owns two more hoodies than Fiona.\n\nWe can translate these statements into the following equations:\n1. \\( F + C = 8 \\)\n2. \\( C = F + 2 \\)\n\nNext, we substitute the expression for \\( C \\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\\[ F + (F + 2) = 8 \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[ 2F + 2 = 8 \\]\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\\[ 2F = 6 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[ F = 3 \\]\n\nSo, Fiona owns \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hoodies.\n\nTo verify, we can find out how many hoodies Casey owns:\n\\[ C = F + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 \\]\n\nCheck the total:\n\\[ F + C = 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nThe total is correct, confirming that Fiona owns \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hoodies.",
        "Let's denote the number of hoodies Fiona owns as \\( F \\). According to the problem, Casey owns two more hoodies than Fiona, so Casey owns \\( F + 2 \\) hoodies.
