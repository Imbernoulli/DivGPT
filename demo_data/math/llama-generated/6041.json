        "To determine the total distance Natalia rode over the four days, we need to calculate the distance she rode each day and then sum these distances.\n\n1. **Monday**: Natalia rode 40 kilometers.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monday} = 40 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tuesday**: Natalia rode 50 kilometers.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tuesday} = 50 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Wednesday**: Natalia rode 50% fewer kilometers than she did on Tuesday.

First, we calculate the sum of Monday's and Wednesday's distances:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monday} + \\text{Wednesday} = 40 \\text{ km} + 25 \\text{ km} = 65 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n   Then, we assign this sum to Thursday's distance:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Thursday} = 65 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Total distance**: To find the total distance Natalia rode over the four days, we sum the distances for each day:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance} = \\text{Monday} + \\text{Tuesday} + \\text{Wednesday} + \\text{Thursday} = 40 \\text{ km} + 50 \\text{ km} + 25 \\text{ km} + 65 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance} = 180 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance Natalia rode is \\boxed{180} kilometers.",
