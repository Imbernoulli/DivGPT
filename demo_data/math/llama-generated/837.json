        "To determine how many questions Grayson leaves unanswered, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time Grayson spends answering questions.\n2. Determine how many questions he answers in that time.\n3. Subtract the number of questions he answers from the total number of questions on the test.\n\nFirst, we know that Grayson spends 2 hours answering questions. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total time in minutes as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Grayson takes 2 minutes to answer each question. Therefore, the number of questions he answers is:\n\\[ \\frac{120 \\text{ minutes}}{2 \\text{ minutes/question}} = 60 \\text{ questions} \\]\n\nSince there are 100 questions on the test, the number of questions Grayson leaves unanswered is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ questions} - 60 \\text{ questions} = 40 \\text{ questions} \\]\n\nThus, the number of questions Grayson leaves unanswered is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
