So, he found \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\) cans at his grandparents' house.\n- His neighbor gave him 46 cans.\n- His dad brought home 250 cans from the office.\n\nAdding all these together, the total number of cans is:\n\\[ 12 + 36 + 46 + 250 = 344 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total amount of money Collin earned from the cans.**\n\nSince Collin earns $0.25 per can, the total amount of money he earned is:\n\\[ 344 \\times 0.25 = 86 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate half of the total amount of money to find out how much he needs to put into savings.**\n\nHalf of $86 is:\n\\[ \\frac{86}{2} = 43 \\]\n\nTherefore, Collin would have to put \\(\\boxed{43}\\) dollars into savings.",
        "To determine how much money Collin would have to put into savings, we first need to calculate the total number of cans he collected from all sources.\n\n1. Collin found 12 cans at home.\n2.

        "To determine how much money Collin would have to put into savings, we need to calculate the total number of cans he collected and then find out how much money he would earn from those cans. Finally, we will calculate half of that amount to determine how much he needs to put into savings.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many cans Collin collected from each location:\n- Collin found 12 cans at home.\n- At his grandparents' house, he found three times as many cans as he found at home. Therefore, he found \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\) cans at his grandparents' house.\n- His neighbor gave him 46 cans.\n- His dad brought home 250 cans from the office.\n\nNext, we add up all the cans he collected:\n\\[12 + 36 + 46 + 250 = 344\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total amount of money Collin would earn from these cans.

The amount of money he brought home from the office is $250 \\times 0.25 = 62.50$. However, since we are asked how much he would have to put into savings based on his total earnings, we need to calculate half of his total earnings:\n\\[86 \\div 2 = 43\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Collin would have to put into savings is:\n\\[\\boxed{43}\\]",

Since he earns $0.25 per can, the total amount of money is:\n\\[344 \\times 0.25 = 86\\]\n\n collin's dad told him to put half of his entire amount collected into savings.

Determine the total amount of money Collin earned from the cans.\n3. Calculate half of the total amount of money earned.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cans Collin collected.**\n\n- Collin found 12 cans at home.\n- He found three times as many at his grandparents' house: \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\) cans.\n- His neighbor gave him 46 cans.\n- His dad brought home 250 cans.\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n12 + 36 + 46 + 250 = 344\n\\]\n\nSo, Collin collected a total of 344 cans.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total amount of money Collin earned from the cans.**\n\nCollin earns $0.25 per can. Therefore, the total amount of money he earned is:\n\\[\n344 \\times 0.25 = 86\n\\]\n\nSo, Collin earned $86 in total.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate half of the total amount of money earned.**\n\nCollin promised to put half of his entire amount collected into savings. Therefore, half of $86 is:\n\\[\n\\frac{86}{2} = 43\n\\]\n\nSo, Collin would have to put \\(\\boxed{43}\\) dollars into savings.",
        "To determine how much money Collin would have to put into savings, we first need to calculate the total number of cans he collected.\n\n1. Collin found 12 cans at home.\n2.

His dad brought home 250 cans from the office.\n\nAdding these amounts together, the total number of cans Collin collected is:\n\\[12 + 36 + 46 + 250 = 344\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total amount of money Collin earned from recycling these cans. Since he earns $0.25 per can, the total amount of money he earned is:\n\\[344 \\times 0.25 = 86\\]\n\nAccording to his dad, Collin needs to put half of his entire amount collected into savings.
