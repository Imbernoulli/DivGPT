        "To determine the total number of colored hangers in Fifi's closet, we need to calculate the number of hangers for each color and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Pink Hangers:**\n   Fifi has 7 pink hangers.\n\n2. **Green Hangers:**\n   Fifi has 4 green hangers.\n\n3. **Blue Hangers:**\n   Fifi has one less blue hanger than there are green hangers.
