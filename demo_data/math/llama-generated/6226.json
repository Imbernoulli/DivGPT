        "To determine how much Adam's father will have after 2 and a half years, including his initial deposit and the interest received, we need to calculate the interest earned over this period and add it to the original deposit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the annual interest earned:\n\\[\n\\text{Annual interest} = \\text{Principal} \\times \\text{Interest rate}\n\\]\nGiven:\n\\[\n\\text{Principal} = \\$2000\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Interest rate} = 8\\% = 0.08\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Annual interest} = 2000 \\times 0.08 = \\$160\n\\]\n\nSince the interest is withdrawn as soon as it is deposited, the principal remains the same each year. Therefore, the interest earned each year is \\$160.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the interest earned over 2 and a half years:\n\\[\n\\text{Interest for 2.5 years} = \\text{Annual interest} \\times 2.5\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Interest for 2.5 years} = 160 \\times 2.5 = \\$400\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the interest earned to the original deposit to find the total amount Adam's father will have after 2 and a half years:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount} = \\text{Principal} + \\text{Interest for 2.5 years}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount} = 2000 + 400 = \\$2400\n\\]\n\nThus, Adam's father will have \\(\\boxed{2400}\\) dollars after 2 and a half years.",
