The loan shark charges Jerry 10% interest compounded monthly. (This means that every month the loan shark adds Jerry's interest amount to his loan, and the next month Jerry has to pay 10% on the new total). If Jerry doesn't make any payments, how much (in dollars) does the loan shark charge in interest the second month?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
