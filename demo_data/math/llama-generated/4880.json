        "To determine the total points Clayton scored during the first four games, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the average points scored by Clayton in the first three games.\n2. Use this average to find out how many points he scored in the fourth game.\n3. Sum the points from all four games.\n\nFirst, let's find the average points scored in the first three games. The points scored in the first three games are 10, 14, and 6. The average is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{10 + 14 + 6}{3} = \\frac{30}{3} = 10\n\\]\nSo, Clayton scored 10 points in the fourth game.\n\nNext, we sum the points from all four games:\n\\[\n10 + 14 + 6 + 10 = 40\n\\]\nTherefore, the total points Clayton scored during the first four games is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
