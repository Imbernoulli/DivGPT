        "To determine how many books are in the library now, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of books in the library, which is 336.\n2. Subtract the number of books taken out on Monday. This is 124 books.\n3. Add the number of books brought back on Tuesday. This is 22 books.\n\nLet's do the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Subtract the books taken out on Monday from the initial number of books:\n   \\[\n   336 - 124 = 212\n   \\]\n   So, after Monday, there are 212 books left in the library.\n\n2.
