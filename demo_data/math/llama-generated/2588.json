        "To determine the total number of notes Jake puts into the complaints and compliments bins, we need to calculate the number of red notes and blue notes separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of red notes. The red notes are arranged in 5 rows with 6 notes in each row. Therefore, the total number of red notes is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 6 = 30\n\\]\nSo, Jake puts 30 red notes into the complaints bin.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of blue notes. There are 2 blue notes under each red note. Since there are 30 red notes, the number of blue notes under the red notes is:\n\\[\n30 \\times 2 = 60\n\\]\nAdditionally, there are 10 blue notes scattered at the bottom of the board. Therefore, the total number of blue notes is:\n\\[\n60 + 10 = 70\n\\]\nSo, Jake puts 70 blue notes into the compliments bin.\n\nFinally, we sum the number of red notes and blue notes to find the total number of notes put into the complaints and compliments bins:\n\\[\n30 + 70 = 100\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of notes put into the complaints and compliments bins is \\boxed{100}.",

Add the number of red notes to the number of blue notes.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of red notes.**\n\nThe red notes are arranged in 5 rows with 6 notes in each row. Therefore, the total number of red notes is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of blue notes.**\n\nThere are 2 blue notes under each red note. Since there are 30 red notes, the number of blue notes under the red notes is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 2 = 60 \\]\n\nAdditionally, there are 10 blue notes scattered at the bottom of the board. Therefore, the total number of blue notes is:\n\\[ 60 + 10 = 70 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the number of red notes to the number of blue notes.**\n\nThe total number of notes put into the complaints and compliments bins is:\n\\[ 30 + 70 = 100 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of notes is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
