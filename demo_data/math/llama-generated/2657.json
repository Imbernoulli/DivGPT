        "To determine how many months ago Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the current duration of their relationship:**\n   Bella and Bob will be celebrating their 4th anniversary in 6 months. Therefore, the current duration of their relationship is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ years} - 6 \\text{ months}\n   \\]\n   Since 1 year equals 12 months, 4 years is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 12 = 48 \\text{ months}\n   \\]\n   So, the current duration of their relationship is:\n   \\[\n   48 \\text{ months} - 6 \\text{ months} = 42 \\text{ months}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the time for their 2nd anniversary:**\n   The 2nd anniversary occurs when their relationship has beenaa for 2 years. Converting 2 years to months:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ months}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many months ago their 2nd anniversary was:**\n   To find out how many months ago their 2nd anniversary was, we subtract the time for their 2nd anniversary from the current duration of their relationship:\n   \\[\n   42 \\text{ months} - 24 \\text{ months} = 18 \\text{ months}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary \\(\\boxed{18}\\) months ago.",
        "To determine how many months ago Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the time at which Bella and Bob will celebrate their 4th anniversary. Since they will celebrate their 4th anniversary in 6 months, we need to calculate the current time relative to their 4th anniversary.\n\n2. If their 4th anniversary is in 6 months, then the current time is 6 months before their 4th anniversary. This means that their current relationship status is 3.5 years from their relationship start date (since 4 years - 6 months = 3.5 years).\n\n3. The 2nd anniversary occurred 2 years after their relationship start date. To find out how many months ago their 2nd anniversary was, we need to calculate the difference between the current time and the time of their 2nd anniversary.\n\n4. The difference between the current time (3.5 years from their relationship start date) and the time of their 2nd anniversary (2 years from their relationship start date) is 1.5 years. Since 1.5 years is equivalent to 18 months (1.5 * 12 = 18), their 2nd anniversary was 18 months ago.\n\nTherefore, the number of months ago that Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
        "To determine how many months ago Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the current time in terms of their anniversary.

Determine how many months ago they celebrated their 2nd anniversary. Since their 2nd anniversary was 2 years into their marriage, and 2 years is equal to \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) months, they celebrated their 2nd anniversary \\(42 - 24 = 18\\) months ago.\n\nThus, Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary \\(\\boxed{18}\\) months ago.",

Calculate the time difference between their current time and their 2nd anniversary.\n\nFirst, we know that in 6 months Bella and Bob will be celebrating their 4th anniversary. This means that their current time is 6 months before their 4th anniversary. Since their 4th anniversary is 4 years after their Jerryunion, we can calculate their current time as follows:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{ years} = 4 \\times 12 = 48 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nSo, their current time is:\n\n\\[ 48 \\text{ months} - 6 \\text{ months} = 42 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many months ago their 2nd anniversary was.

Calculate the time since their 2nd anniversary.\n\nFirst, we know that in 6 months, Bella and Bob will be celebrating their 4th anniversary. This means that their current relationship age is 4 years minus 6 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, 4 years is equivalent to \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) months.

        "To determine how many months ago Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the current time in terms of their relationship. Since in 6 months they will be celebrating their 4th anniversary, we can calculate the current time by subtracting 6 months from their 4th anniversary.\n2. The 4th anniversary is 4 years after they started their relationship. Since there are 12 months in a year, 4 years is equal to \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) months. Therefore, the current time is \\(48 - 6 = 42\\) months after they started their relationship.\n3. The 2nd anniversary is 2 years after they started their relationship. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years is equal to \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) months.

Since 1 year is equal to 12 months, 3.5 years is equal to \\(3.5 \\times 12 = 42\\) months.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many months ago their 2nd anniversary occurred. Since their 2nd anniversary was 2 years after they got married, and 2 years is equal to \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) months, we subtract 24 months from the current number of months they have been married:\n\n\\[42 - 24 = 18\\]\n\nTherefore, Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary \\(\\boxed{18}\\) months ago.",

Determine how many months ago their 2nd anniversary was by subtracting the number of months until their 4th anniversary from the total number of months in 4 years.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many years Bella and Bob have been married so far. They will celebrate their 4th anniversary in 6 months. Therefore, they have been married for \\(4 - \\frac{6}{12} = 4 - 0.5 = 3.5\\) years.\n\nNext, we convert 3.5 years into months.

        "To determine how many months ago Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the current time relative to their 4th anniversary:**\n   Bella and Bob will be celebrating their 4th anniversary in 6 months. This means that currently, they are:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ years} - 6 \\text{ months}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert years to months:**\n   Since 1 year is equal to 12 months, 4 years is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 12 = 48 \\text{ months}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the 6 months from the total months:**\n   Therefore, the current time in months is:\n   \\[\n   48 \\text{ months} - 6 \\text{ months} = 42 \\text{ months}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the time relative to their 2nd anniversary:**\n   Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary 2 years ago. Converting 2 years to months:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ months}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the difference between the current time and their 2nd anniversary:**\n   To find out how many months ago they celebrated their 2nd anniversary, subtract the time of their 2nd anniversary from the current time:\n   \\[\n   42 \\text{ months} - 24 \\text{ months} = 18 \\text{ months}\n
