        "To determine the total number of wheels in the race, we start by finding out how many people are riding bicycles and how many are riding tricycles.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of people riding bicycles:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\text{ of } 40 = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 40 = 3 \\times 8 = 24\n\\]\nSo, there are 24 people riding bicycles.\n\nNext, we find out how many people are riding tricycles. Since there are 40 people in total and 24 are riding bicycles, the number of people riding tricycles is:\n\\[\n40 - 24 = 16\n\\]\nSo, there are 16 people riding tricycles.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of wheels from the bicycles. Since each bicycle has 2 wheels, the total number of wheels from the bicycles is:\n\\[\n24 \\times 2 = 48\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of wheels from the tricycles. Since each tricycle has 3 wheels, the total number of wheels from the tricycles is:\n\\[\n16 \\times 3 = 48\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of wheels from the bicycles and the tricycles to get the total number of wheels in the race:\n\\[\n48 + 48 = 96\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of wheels in the race is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{96}\n\\]",

        "To determine the total number of wheels on the bicycles and tricycles in the race, we start by calculating the number of people riding bicycles and the number of people riding tricycles.\n\nFirst, we find out how many people are riding bicycles. Since 3/5 of the 40 racers are riding bicycles, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of people riding bicycles} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 40 = 24\n\\]\n\nNext, we find out how many people are riding tricycles. Since the total number of racers is 40 and 24 of them are riding bicycles, the number of people riding tricycles is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of people riding tricycles} = 40 - 24 = 16\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of wheels from the bicycles. Each bicycle has 2 wheels, so the total number of wheels from the bicycles is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total wheels from bicycles} = 24 \\times 2 = 48\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of wheels from the tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 wheels, so the total number of wheels from the tricycles is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total wheels from tricycles} = 16 \\times 3 = 48\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the total number of wheels from the bicycles and the total number of wheels from the tricycles to get the combined total number of wheels:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of wheels} = 48 + 48 = 96\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of wheels on the bicycles and tricycles in the race is \\boxed{96}.",
