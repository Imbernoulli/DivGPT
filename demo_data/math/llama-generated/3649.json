        "To determine how many kilograms of food Emily should buy for her 4 dogs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the daily food consumption for all 4 dogs.\n2. Determine the total food consumption for 14 days.\n3. Convert the total food consumption from grams to kilograms.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the daily food consumption for all 4 dogs.**\n\nEach dog eats 250 grams of food per day. Since Emily has 4 dogs, the total daily food consumption is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ dogs} \\times 250 \\text{ grams/dog} = 1000 \\text{ grams/day} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total food consumption for 14 days.**\n\nEmily is going on vacation for 14 days, so the total food consumption for 14 days is:\n\\[ 1000 \\text{ grams/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 14000 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert the total food consumption from grams to kilograms.**\n\nSince there are 1000 grams in a kilogram, we convert 14000 grams to kilograms by dividing by 1000:\n\\[ 14000 \\text{ grams} \\div 1000 = 14 \\text{ kilograms} \\]\n\nTherefore, Emily should buy \\(\\boxed{14}\\) kilograms of food for her 4 dogs.",
        "To determine how many kilograms of food Emily should buy for her 4 dogs while she is on vacation for 14 days, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of food one dog eats in one day.\n2. Calculate the amount of food all four dogs eat in one day.\n3. Calculate the total amount of food all four dogs eat in 14 days.\n4. Convert the total amount of food from grams to kilograms.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\nEach dog eats 250 grams of food per day. Since Emily has 4 dogs, the total amount of food they eat in one day is:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ grams/dog} \\times 4 \\text{ dogs} = 1000 \\text{ grams/day} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of food all four dogs eat in 14 days:\n\\[ 1000 \\text{ grams/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 14000 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the total amount of food from grams to kilograms. Since 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams, we have:\n\\[ 14000 \\text{ grams} \\div 1000 \\text{ grams/kilogram} = 14 \\text{ kilograms} \\]\n\nTherefore, Emily should buy \\(\\boxed{14}\\) kilograms of food for her 4 dogs."
