        "To determine how many kilometers Amelia still has to drive to make it across the country, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance Amelia has already driven.\n2. Subtract the total distance driven from the total distance across the country.\n\nFirst, let's find the total distance Amelia has driven. She drove 907 kilometers on Monday and 582 kilometers on Tuesday. Therefore, the total distance driven is:\n\\[ 907 + 582 \\]\n\nAdding these two numbers together:\n\\[ 907 + 582 = 1489 \\]\n\nSo, Amelia has driven 1489 kilometers so far. The total distance across the country is 8205 kilometers. To find out how many kilometers she still has to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:\n\\[ 8205 - 1489 \\]\n\nSubtracting these two numbers:\n\\[ 8205 - 1489 = 6716 \\]\n\nTherefore, Amelia still has to drive \\(\\boxed{6716}\\) kilometers to make it across the country.",

Subtract the total distance driven from the total distance across the country.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Amelia has already driven. She drove 907 kilometers on Monday and 582 kilometers on Tuesday. So, we add these two distances together:\n\n\\[ 907 + 582 = 1489 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total distance driven from the total distance across the country. The total distance across the country is 8205 kilometers. So, we subtract 1489 kilometers from 8205 kilometers:\n\n\\[ 8205 - 1489 = 6716 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nTherefore, Amelia still has to drive \\(\\boxed{6716}\\) kilometers to make it across the country.",
        "To determine how many kilometers Amelia still has to drive to make it across the country, we start by calculating the total distance she has already driven. Amelia drove 907 kilometers on Monday and 582 kilometers on Tuesday. Therefore, the total distance she has driven so far is:\n\n\\[ 907 + 582 \\]\n\nWe add these two numbers together:\n\n\\[ 907 + 582 = 1489 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance across the country to find out how many kilometers she still has to drive. The total distance across the country is 8205 kilometers. Therefore, the distance she still has to drive is:\n\n\\[ 8205 - 1489 \\]\n\nWe perform the subtraction:\n\n\\[ 8205 - 1489 = 6716 \\]\n\nSo, the number of kilometers Amelia still has to drive to make it across the country is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6716} \\]",
        "To determine how many kilometers Amelia still has to drive to make it across the country, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total distance Amelia has already driven:**\n   - Amelia drove 907 kilometers on Monday.\n   - Amelia drove 582 kilometers on Tuesday.\n   - Add these two distances together:\n     \\[\n     907 + 582\n     \\]\n\n2. **Perform the addition:**\n   \\[\n   907 + 582 = 1489\n   \\]\n   So, Amelia has driven a total of 1489 kilometers.\n\n3. **Subtract the distance Amelia has driven from the total distance across the country:**\n   - The total distance across the country is 8205 kilometers.\n   - Subtract the distance Amelia has driven:\n     \\[\n     8205 - 1489\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the subtraction:**\n   \\[\n   8205 - 1489 = 6716\n   \\]\n   So, Amelia still has 6716 kilometers left to drive.\n\nTherefore, the number of kilometers Amelia still has to drive to make it across the country is \\boxed{6716}."
