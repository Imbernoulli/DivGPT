Add the number of grasshoppers on the plant to the number of baby grasshoppers on the grass.\n   \\[\n   7 + 24 = 31\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of grasshoppers Jemma found is \\(\\boxed{31}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of grasshoppers Jemma found, we need to add the number of grasshoppers on the plant to the number of baby grasshoppers she found on the grass.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 7 grasshoppers on the plant.\n\nNext, we know that Jemma found 2 dozen baby grasshoppers on the grass.
