As he is about to start crafting, he has second thoughts and decides to only use half of his pile of matchsticks. He creates 30 matchsticks houses.

        "To determine how many matchsticks Michael had originally, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of matchsticks Michael used to make the 30 matchstick houses.\n2. Determine how many matchsticks were in the original pile before he decided to use only half of them.\n\nFirst, we know that each matchstick house uses 10 matchsticks and Michael made 30 matchstick houses. Therefore, the total number of matchsticks he used is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ houses} \\times 10 \\text{ matchsticks/house} = 300 \\text{ matchsticks} \\]\n\nSince Michael used only half of his original pile of matchsticks, the total number of matchsticks he used (300) is half of the original number of matchsticks. Let \\( x \\) be the original number of matchsticks. Then:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2} = 300 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ x = 300 \\times 2 = 600 \\]\n\nThus, the original number of matchsticks Michael had is:\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]",
