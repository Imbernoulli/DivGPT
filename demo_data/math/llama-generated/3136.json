Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald:\n\\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \\]\nSo, Sam counted 16 shooting stars.\n\nNow, we find the total number of shooting stars observed by all three:\n\\[ 14 + 12 + 16 = 42 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the average number of shooting stars observed. The average is the total number of shooting stars divided by the number of people:\n\\[ \\frac{42}{3} = 14 \\]\nSo, the average number of shooting stars observed is 14.\n\nFinally, we determine how many more shooting stars Sam counted than the average:\n\\[ 16 - 14 = 2 \\]\nSo, Sam counted \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more shooting stars than the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them.",
