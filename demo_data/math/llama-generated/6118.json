        "To determine how many more photos Malachi took this year than last year, we start by letting the number of selfies he took last year be \\(10x\\) and the number of selfies he took this year be \\(17x\\).

        "To determine how many more photos Malachi took this year than last year, we start by using the given ratio of selfies he took last year to this year, which is 10:17. This means that for every 10 photos he took last year, he took 17 photos this year. The total number of photos he took in both years combined is 2430.\n\nFirst, we find the sum of the parts of the ratio:\n\\[ 10 + 17 = 27 \\]\n\nNext, we determine the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of photos by the sum of the parts:\n\\[ \\frac{2430}{27} = 90 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of photos Malachi took last year by multiplying the value of one part by 10:\n\\[ 10 \\times 90 = 900 \\]\n\n Similarly, we calculate the number of photos Malachi took this year by multiplying the value of one part by 17:\n\\[ 17 \\times 90 = 1530 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of photos taken this year and last year:\n\\[ 1530 - 900 = 630 \\]\n\nThus, Malachi took \\(\\boxed{630}\\) more photos this year than last year.",

        "To determine how many more photos Malachi took this year than last year, we start by understanding the ratio given: 10:17. This means that for every 10 selfies he took last year, he took 17 selfies this year.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio:\n\\[ 10 + 17 = 27 \\]\n\nNext, we know that the total number of photos in his gallery is 2430. To find out how many photos each part of the ratio represents, we divide the total number of photos by the total number of parts:\n\\[ \\frac{2430}{27} = 90 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the number of photos Malachi took last year by multiplying the number of parts for last year by the value of each part:\n\\[ 10 \\times 90 = 900 \\]\n\nSimilarly, we find the number of photos Malachi took this year by multiplying the number of parts for this year by the value of each part:\n\\[ 17 \\times 90 = 1530 \\]\n\nTo find out how many more photos he took this year than last year, we subtract the number of photos taken last year from the number of photos taken this year:\n\\[ 1530 - 900 = 630 \\]\n\nTherefore, Malachi took \\(\\boxed{630}\\) more photos this year than last year.",
        "To determine how many more photos Malachi took this year than last year, we start by letting \\( x \\) represent the number of selfies he took last year and \\( y \\) represent the number of selfies he took this year.
