Hank makes $100 in a carwash and donates 90% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. Hank makes $80 in a bake sale and donates 75% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. Then he makes $50 mowing lawns and donates 100% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. How much money does Hank donate in total?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
