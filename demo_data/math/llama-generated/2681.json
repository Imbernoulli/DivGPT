        "To determine how much Ivan paid in total, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the original total cost of the Uno Giant Family Cards without the discount.\n2. Determine the total discount Ivan received.\n3. Subtract the total discount from the original total cost.\n\nFirst, let's find the original total cost of the Uno Giant Family Cards. Each card costs $12, and Ivan bought 10 cards. So, we multiply the cost per card by the number of cards:\n\n\\[ 12 \\text{ dollars/card} \\times 10 \\text{ cards} = 120 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total discount Ivan received. Since he was given a discount of $2 on each card, and he bought 10 cards, we multiply the discount per card by the number of cards:\n\n\\[ 2 \\text{ dollars/card} \\times 10 \\text{ cards} = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total discount from the original total cost to find out how much Ivan paid:\n\n\\[ 120 \\text{ dollars} - 20 \\text{ dollars} = 100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Ivan paid is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",

Therefore, the discount per card is $2.\n\nNext, we calculate the total discount for ten cards:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ cards} \\times \\$2 \\text{ discount per card} = \\$20 \\text{ total discount} \\]\n\nNow, we find the total cost of ten cards before the discount:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ cards} \\times \\$12 \\text{ per card} = \\$120 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total discount from the total cost before the discount to find out how much Ivan paid in all:\n\\[ \\$120 - \\$20 = \\$100 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Ivan paid is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
