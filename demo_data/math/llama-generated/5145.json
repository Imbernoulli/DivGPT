This past summer, he did a challenging three-day hike across 50 kilometers of wilderness. The first day, he covered 10 kilometers of steep mountainside. The second day was flatter and he was able to cover half the full hike distance. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to finish the hike?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day to finish the hike, we can break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the distance covered on the second day:**\n   Ezekiel covered half of the total hike distance on the second day. The total hike distance is 50 kilometers.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance on the second day} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\text{ kilometers}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total distance covered on the first two days:**\n   Ezekiel covered 10 kilometers on the first day and 25 kilometers on the second day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance on the first two days} = 10 + 25 = 35 \\text{ kilometers}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the distance remaining for the third day:**\n   The total hike distance is 50 kilometers, and Ezekiel has already covered 35 kilometers over the first two days.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance on the third day} = 50 - 35 = 15 \\text{ kilometers}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Ezekiel had to hike \\(\\boxed{15}\\) kilometers on the third day to finish the hike.",
        "To determine how many kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance Ezekiel hiked over the first two days.\n2. Subtract the total distance hiked over the first two days from the total hike distance to find out how many kilometers he had to hike on the third day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Ezekiel hiked on the second day. The problem states that the second day he covered half the full hike distance. Since the total hike distance is 50 kilometers, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance hiked on the second day} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\text{ kilometers}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the distance hiked on the first day to the distance hiked on the second day to find the total distance hiked over the first two days. The problem states that Ezekiel hiked 10 kilometers on the first day, so we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Total distance hiked over the first two days} = 10 + 25 = 35 \\text{ kilometers}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total distance hiked over the first two days from the total hike distance to find out how many kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance hiked on the third day} = 50 - 35 = 15 \\text{ kilometers}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day to finish the hike is \\boxed{15}.",
