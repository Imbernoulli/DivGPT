        "To determine the total number of stars Tilly counts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of stars to the east of her house.\n2. Calculate the number of stars to the west of her house.\n3. Add the number of stars to the east and the number of stars to the west to get the total number of stars.\n\nFirst, we know that Tilly counts 120 stars to the east of her house. Let's denote this number as \\( E \\):\n\\[ E = 120 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that the number of stars to the west of her house is six times the number of stars to the east. Let's denote the number of stars to the west as \\( W \\):\n\\[ W = 6 \\times E \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( E \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ W = 6 \\times 120 = 720 \\]\n\nNow, to find the total number of stars Tilly counts, we add the number of stars to the east and the number of stars to the west:\n\\[ \\text{Total stars} = E + W = 120 + 720 = 840 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of stars Tilly counts is \\(\\boxed{840}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of stars Tilly counts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of stars to the east of Tilly's house.\n2. Calculate the number of stars to the west of Tilly's house.\n3. Add the number of stars to the east and the number of stars to the west to find the total number of stars.\n\nFirst, we know that Tilly counts 120 stars to the east of her house.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of stars to the west of Tilly's house. According to the problem, she counts six times the number of stars to the west as she does to the east. Therefore, we multiply the number of stars to the east by 6:\n\\[ 120 \\times 6 = 720 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of stars to the east and the number of stars to the west to find the total number of stars:\n\\[ 120 + 720 = 840 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of stars Tilly counts is \\(\\boxed{840}\\)."
