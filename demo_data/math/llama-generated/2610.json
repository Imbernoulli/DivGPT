        "To determine the total number of flowers Ginger sold on Tuesday, we need to find the number of roses, lilacs, and gardenias sold and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that Ginger sold 10 lilacs. Let's denote the number of lilacs sold by \\( L \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ L = 10 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Ginger sold three times more roses than lilacs. Let's denote the number of roses sold by \\( R \\). Therefore, we can express the number of roses sold as:\n\\[ R = 3L \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( L \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ R = 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Ginger sold half as many gardenias as lilacs. Let's denote the number of gardenias sold by \\( G \\). Therefore, we can express the number of gardenias sold as:\n\\[ G = \\frac{L}{2} \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( L \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ G = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of roses, lilacs, and gardenias sold to find the total number of flowers sold on Tuesday:\n\\[ \\text{Total flowers} = R + L + G = 30 + 10 + 5 = 45 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of flowers sold on Tuesday is:\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of flowers Ginger sold on Tuesday, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the number of each type of flower sold.\n\n1. **Determine the number of roses sold:**\n   Ginger sold three times more roses than lilacs. Given that she sold 10 lilacs, we can calculate the number of roses as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of roses} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of lilacs} = 3 \\times 10 = 30\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of gardenias sold:**\n   Ginger sold half as many gardenias as lilacs. Given that she sold 10 lilacs, we can calculate the number of gardenias as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of gardenias} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Number of lilacs} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 = 5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of flowers sold:**\n   To find the total number of flowers sold, we add the number of roses, lilacs, and gardenias:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of flowers} = \\text{Number of roses} + \\text{Number of lilacs} + \\text{Number of gardenias} = 30 + 10 + 5 = 45\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of flowers sold on Tuesday is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
