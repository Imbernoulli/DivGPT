        "To determine the sum of all the money that Carmen, Jethro, and Patricia have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine how much money Jethro has:**\n   Patricia has $60, which is 3 times as much as Jethro. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   3J = 60\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( J \\) (Jethro's money):\n   \\[\n   J = \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, Jethro has $20.\n\n2. **Determine how much money Carmen has:**\n   Carmen needs $7 more to have twice the amount of money that Jethro has. We know Jethro has $20, so twice that amount is:\n   \\[\n   2J = 2 \\times 20 = 40\n   \\]\n   Carmen needs $7 more to have $40, so her current amount of money is:\n   \\[\n   C = 40 - 7 = 33\n   \\]\n   So, Carmen has $33.\n\n3. **Determine the sum of all their money:**\n   Patricia has $60, Jethro has $20, and Carmen has $33. Adding these amounts together gives:\n   \\[\n   P + J + C = 60 + 20 + 33 = 113\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of all their money is \\(\\boxed{113}\\).",
        "To determine the sum of all the money that Carmen, Jethro, and Patricia have, we need to find out how much money each of them has individually.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much money Jethro has. We know that Patricia has $60, and this amount is 3 times as much as Jethro. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 60 = 3J \\]\nwhere \\( J \\) is the amount of money Jethro has. To find \\( J \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ J = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\]\nSo, Jethro has $20.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Carmen has. We know that Carmen needs $7 more to have twice the amount of money that Jethro has. Since Jethro has $20, twice the amount of money that Jethro has is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\]\nTherefore, Carmen has $7 less than $40:\n\\[ C = 40 - 7 = 33 \\]\nSo, Carmen has $33.\n\nNow, we know the amount of money each person has:\n- Carmen has $33,\n- Jethro has $20,\n- Patricia has $60.\n\nTo find the sum of all their money, we add these amounts together:\n\\[ 33 + 20 + 60 = 113 \\]\n\nThus, the sum of all their money is:\n\\[ \\boxed{113} \\]",

Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Jethro's amount of money:\n\\[\nP = 3J\n\\]\nwhere \\(P\\) is Patricia's money and \\(J\\) is Jethro's money.
