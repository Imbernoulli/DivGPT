        "To determine the total number of dogs Carly worked on, we need to consider the following information:\n\n1. Carly trimmed 164 nails.\n2. Each dog typically has four paws, and each paw has four nails, so each dog has \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) nails.\n3. Three of the dogs had only three legs, so each of these dogs has \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) nails.\n\nLet's denote the number of dogs with four legs as \\(x\\) and the number of dogs with three legs as \\(y\\). According to the problem, \\(y = 3\\). The total number of nails trimmed can be expressed by the equation:\n\\[16x + 12y = 164.\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(y = 3\\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[16x + 12 \\times 3 = 164,\\]\n\\[16x + 36 = 164.\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\(x\\) by subtracting 36 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[16x = 128.\\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 16:\n\\[x = 8.\\]\n\nThe total number of dogs Carly worked on is the sum of the dogs with four legs and the dogs with three legs:\n\\[x + y = 8 + 3 = 11.\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of dogs Carly worked on is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
