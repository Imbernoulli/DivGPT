        "To determine how many more fish Gail would have in the first tank than the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the size of the second tank:**\n   - The first tank is twice the size of the second tank.\n   - The first tank has 48 gallons of water.\n   - Therefore, the second tank has:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{48}{2} = 24 \\text{ gallons}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of fish in the second tank:**\n   - Each fish in the second tank is 2 inches long.\n   - According to the rule, there is one gallon of water per inch of fish.\n   - Thus, the number of fish in the second tank is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{24 \\text{ gallons}}{2 \\text{ inches per fish}} = 12 \\text{ fish}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of fish in the first tank before one fish eats another:**\n   - Each fish in the first tank is 3 inches long.\n   - According to the rule, there is one gallon of water per inch of fish.\n   - Thus, the number of fish in the first tank is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{48 \\text{ gallons}}{3 \\text{ inches per fish}} = 16 \\text{ fish}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of fish in the first tank after one fish eats another:**\n   - One fish in the first tank eats another, so the number of fish decreases by one.\n   - Therefore, the number of fish in the first tank after one fish eats another is:\n     \\[\n     16 - 1 = 15 \\text{ fish}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate how many more fish Gail has in the first tank than the second tank:**\n   - The number of fish in the first tank after one fish eats another is 15.\n   - The number of fish in the second tank is 12.\n   - Thus, the difference is:\n     \\[\n     15 - 12 = 3\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Gail would have \\(\\boxed{3}\\) more fish in the first tank than in the second tank after one fish in the first tank eats another.",
