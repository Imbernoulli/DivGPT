He watches a 4-minute video of cats.  He then watches a video twice as long as the cat video involving dogs.  He finishes up his video watching for the day by watching a video on gorillas that's twice as long as the previous two videos combined.  How many minutes does Brian spend watching animal videos?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total time Brian spends watching animal videos, we need to calculate the length of each video he watches and then sum these lengths.\n\n1. **Cat Video:**\n   The cat video is 4 minutes long.\n\n2. **Dog Video:**\n   The dog video is twice as long as the cat video. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Gorilla Video:**\n   The gorilla video is twice as long as the combined length of the cat and dog videos.
