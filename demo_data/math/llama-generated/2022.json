        "To determine how many more squares Betsy needs to sew together, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of squares in the quilt.\n2. Determine how many squares Betsy has already sewn.\n3. Subtract the number of squares already sewn from the total number of squares to find out how many more squares she needs to sew.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of squares in the quilt. The quilt is made up of 16 squares sewn together on one side and 16 squares sewn together on the other side. Therefore, the total number of squares is:\n\\[\n16 \\times 2 = 32\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many squares Betsy has already sewn. She has sewn 25% of the quilt. To find 25% of 32, we multiply 32 by 0.25:\n\\[\n32 \\times 0.25 = 8\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of squares already sewn from the total number of squares to find out how many more squares she needs to sew:\n\\[\n32 - 8 = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Betsy needs to sew together \\boxed{24} more squares.",

        "To determine how many more squares Betsy needs to sew together, we start by calculating the total number of squares in the quilt. Since the quilt is made up of 16 squares on each side, we multiply:\n\n\\[\n16 \\times 2 = 32\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many squares Betsy has already sewn. She has sewn 25% of the quilt. To find 25% of 32, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 32 = 8\n\\]\n\nBetsy has already sewn 8 squares. To find out how many more squares she needs to sew, we subtract the number of squares she has already sewn from the total number of squares:\n\n\\[\n32 - 8 = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Betsy needs to sew together \\boxed{24} more squares.",
