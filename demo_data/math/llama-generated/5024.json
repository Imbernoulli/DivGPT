        "To determine the total number of bags of fruit Austin picked, we need to calculate the number of bags of apples and the number of bags of pears he picked separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many bags of apples Austin picked. According to the problem, Austin picked 6 bags of apples more than Dallas. Since Dallas picked 14 bags of apples, we can calculate the number of bags of apples Austin picked as follows:\n\\[\n14 + 6 = 20\n\\]\nSo, Austin picked 20 bags of apples.\n\nNext, let's find out how many bags of pears Austin picked. According to the problem, Austin picked 5 fewer bags of pears than Dallas. Since Dallas picked 9 bags of pears, we can calculate the number of bags of pears Austin picked as follows:\n\\[\n9 - 5 = 4\n\\]\nSo, Austin picked 4 bags of pears.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of bags of fruit Austin picked by adding the number of bags of apples and the number of bags of pears:\n\\[\n20 + 4 = 24\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of bags of fruit Austin picked is \\boxed{24}.",

Since Dallas picked 14 bags of apples, we can calculate the number of bags of apples Austin picked as follows:\n\\[\n14 + 6 = 20\n\\]\nSo, Austin picked 20 bags of apples.\n\nNext, we find out how many bags of pears Austin picked. The problem states that Austin picked 5 fewer bags of pears than Dallas. Since Dallas picked 9 bags of pears, we can calculate the number of bags of pears Austin picked as follows:\n\\[\n9 - 5 = 4\n\\]\nSo, Austin picked 4 bags of pears.\n\nNow, we add the number of bags of apples and pears Austin picked to find the total number of bags of fruit he picked:\n\\[\n20 + 4 = 24\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of bags of fruit Austin picked is \\boxed{24}.",
