        "To determine in how many years Beth will be twice her sister's age, we start by defining the current ages and setting up an equation based on the future ages.\n\n1. Let's denote the current age of Beth as \\( B \\) and the current age of her sister as \\( S \\).\n2. According to the problem, Beth is currently 18 years old and her sister is 5 years old. Therefore, \\( B = 18 \\) and \\( S = 5 \\).\n3. Let \\( x \\) be the number of years from now when Beth will be twice her sister's age.\n4.

Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   B + x = 2(S + x)\n   \\]\n6.
