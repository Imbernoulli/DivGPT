        "To determine how many hours' worth of days Mark has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of sick days and vacation days Mark has at the beginning of the year.\n2. Determine how many sick days and vacation days Mark uses.\n3. Calculate how many sick days and vacation days Mark has left.\n4. Convert the remaining days into hours.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of sick days and vacation days Mark has at the beginning of the year:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ sick days} + 10 \\text{ vacation days} = 20 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many sick days and vacation days Mark uses. Since he uses half of his allotment of both types of days:\n\\[ \\frac{10}{2} \\text{ sick days} + \\frac{10}{2} \\text{ vacation days} = 5 \\text{ sick days} + 5 \\text{ vacation days} = 10 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate how many sick days and vacation days Mark has left:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ days} - 10 \\text{ days} = 10 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the remaining days into hours. Since each day covers an 8-hour workday:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ days} \\times 8 \\text{ hours/day} = 80 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hours' worth of days Mark has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]",

Convert the remaining days into hours.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of sick days and vacation days Mark has at the beginning of the year. He gets 10 sick days and 10 vacation days, so the total is:\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many sick days and vacation days Mark uses. Since he uses half of his allotment of both types of days, he uses:\n\\[ \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ sick days} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ vacation days} \\]\nSo, the total number of days he uses is:\n\\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of sick days and vacation days Mark has left:\n\\[ 20 - 10 = 10 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the remaining days into hours. Since each day covers an 8-hour workday, the total number of hours left is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 8 = 80 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hours' worth of days Mark has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]",
