Her mother gave her twice as much as her original amount:\n\\[ 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\]\nSo, after receiving money from her mother, Faye had:\n\\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the cupcakes. Faye bought ten cupcakes at $1.50 each:\n\\[ 10 \\times 1.50 = 15 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total cost of the cookies. Faye bought five boxes of cookies at $3 per box:\n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\]\n\nNow, we add the total cost of the cupcakes and cookies:\n\\[ 15 + 15 = 30 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total cost of the cupcakes and cookies from the total amount of money Faye had:\n\\[ 60 - 30 = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Faye had left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",

Subtract the total cost of the cupcakes and cookies from the total amount of money Faye has.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Faye has after receiving money from her mother. Faye initially had $20, and her mother gave her twice as much as her money. Therefore, her mother gave her:\n\\[ 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding this to her initial amount, Faye now has:\n\\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's determine the total cost of the cupcakes. Faye bought ten cupcakes at $1.50 each. Therefore, the total cost of the cupcakes is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 1.50 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's determine the total cost of the boxes of cookies. Faye bought five boxes of cookies at $3 per box. Therefore, the total cost of the boxes of cookies is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the total cost of the cupcakes and the total cost of the boxes of cookies, the total amount spent is:\n\\[ 15 + 15 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, subtracting the total amount spent from the total amount of money Faye has, the amount of money she has left is:\n\\[ 60 - 30 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Faye has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",

Determine Faye's total amount of money after receiving money from her mother.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the cupcakes.\n4. Calculate the total cost of the cookies.\n5. Find out how much money Faye has left after buying the cupcakes and cookies.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Faye's mother gave her twice as much money as Faye had. Faye initially had $20, so her mother gave her:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Faye's total amount of money after receiving money from her mother is:\n   \\[\n   20 + 40 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we calculate the total cost of the cupcakes. Faye bought ten cupcakes at $1.50 each:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 1.50 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. Then, we calculate the total cost of the cookies. Faye bought five boxes of cookies at $3 per box:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 3 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. Now, we find out how much money Faye has left after buying the cupcakes and cookies. The total cost of the cupcakes and cookies is:\n   \\[\n   15 + 15 = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the amount of money Faye has left is:\n   \\[\n   60 - 30 = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money Faye has left is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

Determine Faye's total amount of money after receiving money from her mother.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the cupcakes.\n4. Calculate the total cost of the cookies.\n5. Subtract the total cost of the cupcakes and cookies from Faye's total amount of money.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of money Faye's mother gave her. Faye had $20, and her mother gave her twice as much:\n\\[\n2 \\times 20 = 40\n\\]\nSo, Faye's mother gave her $40.\n\nNext, we determine Faye's total amount of money after receiving money from her mother:\n\\[\n20 + 40 = 60\n\\]\nSo, Faye now has $60.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of the cupcakes. Each cupcake costs $1.50, and Faye bought ten cupcakes:\n\\[\n10 \\times 1.50 = 15\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the cupcakes is $15.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the cookies. Each box of cookies costs $3, and Faye bought five boxes:\n\\[\n5 \\times 3 = 15\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the cookies is $15.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total cost of the cupcakes and cookies from Faye's total amount of money:\n\\[\n60 - 15 - 15 = 30\n\\]\nSo, the amount of money Faye has left is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
