Determine how much flour is required for one biscuit.\n3. Calculate the total amount of flour needed for the total number of biscuits.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of biscuits Lady Bird needs.**\n\nLady Bird is hosting 18 members and wants to make sure she allows 2 biscuits per guest. Therefore, the total number of biscuits needed is:\n\\[ 18 \\text{ members} \\times 2 \\text{ biscuits/member} = 36 \\text{ biscuits} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much flour is required for one biscuit.**\n\n lady Bird uses 1 1/4 cups of flour to make 9 biscuits. First, we convert 1 1/4 to an improper fraction:\n\\[ 1 \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{5}{4} \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNext, we find out how much flour is needed for one biscuit by dividing \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\) cups by 9 biscuits:\n\\[ \\frac{5}{4} \\div 9 = \\frac{5}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{5}{36} \\text{ cups per biscuit} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of flour needed for the total number of biscuits.**\n\nNow, we multiply the amount of flour needed for one biscuit by the total number of biscuits (36):\n\\[ 36 \\text{ biscuits} \\times \\frac{5}{36} \\text{ cups per biscuit} = 5 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nTherefore, Lady Bird will need \\(\\boxed{5}\\) cups of flour."
