        "To determine the most number of times a person can ski down the mountain in 2 hours, we need to consider both the time it takes to ride the lift up and the time it takes to ski back down. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Calculate the total time for one complete cycle of riding the lift up and skiing down:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for one cycle} = \\text{Time to ride up} + \\text{Time to ski down} = 15 \\text{ minutes} + 5 \\text{ minutes} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the total number of cycles that can fit into 2 hours. Since 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, we divide 120 minutes by the time for one cycle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cycles} = \\frac{120 \\text{ minutes}}{20 \\text{ minutes/cycle}} = 6 \\text{ cycles}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the most number of times a person can ski down the mountain in 2 hours is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
