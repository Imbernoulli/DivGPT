        "To determine how much more money Bob has than Alice after their investments, we need to calculate the final amounts of money each of them has and then find the difference between these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much money Alice has after investing in the stock market. Alice starts with $2000 and doubles her money. Therefore, we multiply $2000 by 2:\n\\[\n2000 \\times 2 = 4000\n\\]\nSo, Alice has $4000 after her investment.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much money Bob has after investing in real estate. Bob starts with $2000 and makes five times more money than he invested. Therefore, we multiply $2000 by 6 (since he gets his original investment back plus five times more):\n\\[\n2000 \\times 6 = 12000\n\\]\nSo, Bob has $12000 after his investment.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more money Bob has than Alice. We do this by subtracting the amount of money Alice has from the amount of money Bob has:\n\\[\n12000 - 4000 = 8000\n\\]\nSo, Bob has \\(\\boxed{8000}\\) dollars more than Alice.",
