        "To determine how many pieces of candy were left after Travis and his brother ate some, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pieces of candy eaten by Travis and his brother:**\n   - Each of them ate 4 pieces of candy.\n   - Since there are two of them, the total number of pieces eaten is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ pieces/person} \\times 2 \\text{ people} = 8 \\text{ pieces}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the total number of pieces eaten from the initial total:**\n   - They initially collected 68 pieces of candy.\n   - After eating 8 pieces, the number of pieces left is:\n     \\[\n     68 \\text{ pieces} - 8 \\text{ pieces} = 60 \\text{ pieces}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of candy left is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",

Determine how many pieces of candy each of them ate. The problem states that each of them ate 4 pieces of candy.\n3. Calculate the total number of pieces of candy eaten by both Travis and his brother. Since each of them ate 4 pieces, the total number of pieces eaten is \\(4 + 4 = 8\\).\n4. Subtract the total number of pieces of candy eaten from the total number of pieces of candy collected to find out how many pieces of candy were left. This can be calculated as \\(68 - 8 = 60\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of candy left is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
