Hortense planted 25 daisy seeds, and 60% of them germinate.\n   \\[\n   25 \\times 0.60 = 15\n   \\]\n   So, 15 daisy seeds germinate.\n\n2. 80% of the germinated daisy plants produce flowers.\n   \\[\n   15 \\times 0.80 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, 12 daisy plants produce flowers.\n\nNext, let's do the same calculations for the sunflower seeds:\n\n3. Hortense planted 25 sunflower seeds, and 80% of them germinate.\n   \\[\n   25 \\times 0.80 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, 20 sunflower seeds germinate.\n\n4. 80% of the germinated sunflower plants produce flowers.\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 0.80 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, 16 sunflower plants produce flowers.\n\nFinally, we add the number of daisy plants that produce flowers to the number of sunflower plants that produce flowers:\n\\[\n12 + 16 = 28\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of plants that Hortense will grow that produce flowers is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",

Add the number of flowers produced by the daisy plants and the sunflower plants.\n\nLet's start with the daisy seeds:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of daisy seeds that germinate:**\n   Hortense planted 25 daisy seeds, and 60% of them germinate.\n   \\[\n   0.60 \\times 25 = 15\n   \\]\n   So, 15 daisy seeds germinate.\n\n2. **Determine how many of the germinated daisy plants produce flowers:**\n   80% of the germinated daisy plants produce flowers.\n   \\[\n   0.80 \\times 15 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, 12 daisy plants produce flowers.\n\nNext, let's move on to the sunflower seeds:\n\n3. **Calculate the number of sunflower seeds that germinate:**\n   Hortense planted 25 sunflower seeds, and 80% of them germinate.\n   \\[\n   0.80 \\times 25 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, 20 sunflower seeds germinate.\n\n4. **Determine how many of the germinated sunflower plants produce flowers:**\n   80% of the germinated sunflower plants produce flowers.\n   \\[\n   0.80 \\times 20 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, 16 sunflower plants produce flowers.\n\nFinally, we add the number of flowers produced by the daisy plants and the sunflower plants:\n\n5. **Add the number of flowers produced by the daisy plants and the sunflower plants:**\n   \\[\n   12 + 16 = 28\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of plants that produce flowers is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
