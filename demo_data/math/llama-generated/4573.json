He jogs for 30 minutes each day and jogs for 5 days in the second week:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 150 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we add the total minutes from both weeks to find the overall total:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ minutes} + 150 \\text{ minutes} = 240 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTo convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\\[ 240 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Larry jogs in two weeks is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
