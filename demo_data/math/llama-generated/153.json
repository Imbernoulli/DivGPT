        "To determine how much farther Emily walks to school and back in five days compared to Troy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the daily distance each person walks:**\n   - Troy walks to school and back home each day. The distance to school is 75 meters, so the total distance he walks in one day is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 75 = 150 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n\n   - Emily walks to school and back home each day. The distance to school is 98 meters, so the total distance she walks in one day is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 98 = 196 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the weekly distance each person walks:**\n   - Troy walks to school and back home every day for 5 days. Therefore, the total distance he walks in five days is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 150 = 750 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n\n   - Emily walks to school and back home every day for 5 days. Therefore, the total distance she walks in five days is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 196 = 980 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine how much farther Emily walks compared to Troy:**\n   - To find out how much farther Emily walks than Troy in five days, we subtract the total distance Troy walks from the total distance Emily walks:\n     \\[\n     980 - 750 = 230 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Emily walks \\(\\boxed{230}\\) meters farther to school and back in five days than Troy.",

Since Emily's home is 98 meters away from school, she walks 98 meters to school and 98 meters back home. Therefore, the total distance Emily walks in one day is:\n\\[ 98 \\text{ meters} + 98 \\text{ meters} = 196 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance Troy walks in five days. Since Troy walks 150 meters each day, the total distance he walks in five days is:\n\\[ 150 \\text{ meters/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 750 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total distance Emily walks in five days. Since Emily walks 196 meters each day, the total distance she walks in five days is:\n\\[ 196 \\text{ meters/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 980 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nFinally, let's find the difference between the total distances Emily and Troy walk in five days:\n\\[ 980 \\text{ meters} - 750 \\text{ meters} = 230 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nTherefore, Emily walks \\(\\boxed{230}\\) meters farther to school and back in five days than Troy.",
        "To determine how much farther Emily walks to school and back in five days compared to Troy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the daily distance each person walks:**\n   - Troy walks to school and back home:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 75 \\text{ meters} = 150 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n   - Emily walks to school and back home:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 98 \\text{ meters} = 196 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the weekly distance each person walks:**\n   - Troy walks this distance every day for five days:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 150 \\text{ meters} = 750 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n   - Emily walks this distance every day for five days:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 196 \\text{ meters} = 980 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the difference in the weekly distances:**\n   - Subtract Troy's total weekly distance from Emily's total weekly distance:\n     \\[\n     980 \\text{ meters} - 750 \\text{ meters} = 230 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Emily walks \\(\\boxed{230}\\) meters farther to school and back in five days than Troy."
