        "To determine the number of sunflowers Rose bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of flowers left after buying the daisies:**\n   Rose bought one dozen flowers, which is 12 flowers.\n   She bought 2 daisies.\n   \\[\n   12 - 2 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, there are 10 flowers left after buying the daisies.\n\n2. **Determine the number of tulips:**\n   Three-fifths of the remaining flowers are tulips.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{5} \\times 10 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, there are 6 tulips.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers:**\n   The rest of the flowers are sunflowers. After buying the daisies and tulips, the remaining flowers are:\n   \\[\n   10 - 6 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, there are 4 sunflowers.\n\nThus, the number of sunflowers is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
