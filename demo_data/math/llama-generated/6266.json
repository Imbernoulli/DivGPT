        "To determine the total number of family members John has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of family members on John's father's side, which is given as 10.\n2. Calculate the number of family members on John's mother's side. Since his mother's side is 30% larger than his father's side, we can find the number of family members on his mother's side by multiplying 10 by 1.30 (which is the same as adding 30% to the original number).\n\nLet's do the calculation step-by-step:\n\\[ 10 \\times 1.30 = 13 \\]\n\nSo, John has 13 family members on his mother's side.\n\n3. Add the number of family members on John's father's side to the number of family members on his mother's side to get the total number of family members:\n\\[ 10 + 13 = 23 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of family members John has is \\(\\boxed{23}\\).",
