        "To determine how many dollars' worth of groceries Alex delivered, we start by calculating how much more money he needs to save.

He charges $1.5 per trip and 5% of the price of the groceries. If he makes 40 trips, the money earned from the trips is:\n\n\\[40 \\times 1.5 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\\]\n\nLet \\(x\\) be the total value of the groceries he delivered. The money earned from the groceries is 5% of \\(x\\), which is:\n\n\\[0.05x\\]\n\nThe total amount of money Alex earns from both the trips and the groceries is:\n\n\\[60 + 0.05x\\]\n\nWe know that this total amount must equal the amount of money he needs to save, which is $100. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[60 + 0.05x = 100\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we first subtract 60 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[0.05x = 40\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 0.05:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{40}{0.05} = 800\\]\n\nSo, the total value of the groceries Alex delivered is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{800}\\]",

He earns 5% of the value of the groceries, so the money earned from the groceries is:\n\\[ 0.05 \\times x = 0.05x \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total amount of money Alex earns from both the trips and the groceries is:\n\\[ 60 + 0.05x \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince Alex already has $14,500 saved up and the car costs $14,600, he needs $100 more to buy the car. Therefore, the total amount of money he earns from delivering groceries is equal to $100. We can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 60 + 0.05x = 100 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first subtract 60 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 0.05x = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 0.05:\n\\[ x = \\frac{40}{0.05} = 800 \\]\n\nSo, the total value of the groceries Alex delivered is:\n\\[ \\boxed{800} \\]",
