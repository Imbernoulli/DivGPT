        "To determine how many shoes Page has after donating and buying more, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of pairs donated:**\n   Page decides to donate 30% of her 80 pairs of shoes. We can find 30% by multiplying 80 by 0.30.\n   \\[\n   80 \\times 0.30 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, Page donates 24 pairs of shoes.\n\n2. **Determine the number of pairs remaining after the donation:**\n   After donating 24 pairs, the number of pairs left is:\n   \\[\n   80 - 24 = 56\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add the new pairs purchased:**\n   Page buys 6 more pairs of shoes. Adding these to the remaining pairs gives:\n   \\[\n   56 + 6 = 62\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pairs of shoes Page has now is \\(\\boxed{62}\\).",
