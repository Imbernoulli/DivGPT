        "To determine Olivia's new insurance premium after one accident and three tickets, we need to calculate the increases from each event and then add them to the original premium.\n\n1. **Calculate the increase from the accident:**\n   - The original premium is $50.\n   - The increase for one accident is 10% of $50.\n   \\[\n   10\\% \\text{ of } 50 = 0.10 \\times 50 = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the premium increases by $5 due to the accident.\n\n2. **Calculate the increase from the tickets:**\n   - Each ticket increases the premium by $5.\n   - Olivia gets 3 tickets.\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ tickets} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars per ticket} = 15\n   \\]\n   So, the premium increases by $15 due to the tickets.\n\n3. **Calculate the total increase:**\n   - Add the increase from the accident and the increase from the tickets.\n   \\[\n   5 + 15 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the total increase in the premium is $20.\n\n4. **Calculate the new insurance premium:**\n   - Add the total increase to the original premium.\n   \\[\n   50 + 20 = 70\n   \\]\n   So, Olivia's new insurance premium is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",

        "To determine Olivia's new insurance premium, we need to account for the increases due to her accident and tickets. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Premium**: Olivia's insurance premium starts at $50/month.\n\n2. **Increase Due toieraæ‡‚**: The premium increases by 10% for each accident. Since Olivia gets in one accident, we calculate the increase as follows:\n   \\[\n   10\\% \\text{ of } \\$50 = 0.10 \\times \\$50 = \\$5\n   \\]\n   So, the premium increases by $5 due to the accident.\n\n3. **Increase Due to Tickets**: The premium increases by $5/month for each ticket. Since Olivia gets 3 tickets, we calculate the increase as follows:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ tickets} \\times \\$5/\\text{ticket} = \\$15\n   \\]\n   So, the premium increases by $15 due to the tickets.\n\n4. **Total Increase**: Now, we add the increases due to the accident and the tickets:\n   \\[\n   \\$5 + \\$15 = \\$20\n   \\]\n\n5. **New Premium**: Finally, we add the total increase to the initial premium:\n   \\[\n   \\$50 + \\$20 = \\$70\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Olivia's new insurance premium is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",
