        "To determine the total number of cans collected by Solomon, Juwan, and Levi, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many cans Juwan collected.\n2. Use Juwan's can count to find out how many cans Levi collected.\n3. Sum the cans collected by Solomon, Juwan, and Levi.\n\nFirst, we know that Solomon collected 66 cans and that he collected three times as many cans as Juwan. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ \\text{Solomon's cans} = 3 \\times \\text{Juwan's cans} \\]\n\\[ 66 = 3 \\times \\text{Juwan's cans} \\]\nTo find out how many cans Juwan collected, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ \\text{Juwan's cans} = \\frac{66}{3} = 22 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Levi collected half of what Juwan collected. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ \\text{Levi's cans} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Juwan's cans} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Levi's cans} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 22 = 11 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the cans collected by Solomon, Juwan, and Levi:\n\\[ \\text{Total cans} = \\text{Solomon's cans} + \\text{Juwan's cans} + \\text{Levi's cans} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total cans} = 66 + 22 + 11 = 99 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cans collected by the boys is \\(\\boxed{99}\\).",
