        "To determine how much money James made, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of pork James buys.\n2. Determine the total amount of meat James has.\n3. Calculate the number of meals James can make.\n4. Determine the total revenue from selling the meals.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of pork James buys. Since he buys half as much pork as beef, and he buys 20 pounds of beef, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Pork} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, let's find the total amount of meat James has. This is the sum of the beef and the pork:\n\\[ \\text{Total meat} = 20 + 10 = 30 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many meals James can make. Since each meal uses 1.5 pounds of meat, the number of meals he can make is:\n\\[ \\text{Number of meals} = \\frac{30}{1.5} = 20 \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the meals. Since each meal sells for $20, the total revenue is:\n\\[ \\text{Total revenue} = 20 \\times 20 = 400 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money James made is:\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]",
