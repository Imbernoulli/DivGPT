Then, we can find out how many points she scored from three-point baskets and average that over the number of games.\n\n1. **Calculate the total points from free throws:**\n   Yolanda averaged 4 free throws per game. Since there were 15 games, the total number of free throws she made is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ free throws/game} \\times 15 \\text{ games} = 60 \\text{ free throws}\n   \\]\n   Since each free throw is worth 1 point, the total points from free throws is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ free throws} \\times 1 \\text{ point/free throw} = 60 \\text{ points}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total points from two-point baskets:**\n   Yolanda averaged 5 two-point baskets per game. Since there were 15 games, the total number of two-point baskets she made is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ two-point baskets/game} \\times 15 \\text{ games} = 75 \\text{ two-point baskets}\n   \\]\n   Since each two-point basket is worth 2 points, the total points from two-point baskets is:\n   \\[\n   75 \\text{ two-point baskets} \\times 2 \\text{ points/two-point basket} = 150 \\text{ points}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total points from three-point baskets:**\n   Yolanda's total points over the season is 345. The points from free throws and two-point baskets together is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ points} + 150 \\text{ points} = 210 \\text{ points}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the points from three-point baskets is:\n   \\[\n   345 \\text{ points} - 210 \\text{ points} = 135 \\text{ points}\n   \\]\n   Since each three-point basket is worth 3 points, the total number of three-point baskets she made is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{135 \\text{ points}}{3 \\text{ points/three-point basket}} = 45 \\text{ three-point baskets}\n   \\]\n   To find the average number of three-point baskets per game, we divide the total number of three-point baskets by the number of games:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{45 \\text{ three-point baskets}}{15 \\text{ games}} = 3 \\text{ three-point baskets/game}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Yolanda averaged \\(\\boxed{3}\\) three-point baskets per game.",
        "To determine how many three-point baskets Yolanda averaged per game, we need to break down her total points into the points from free throws, two-point baskets, and three-point baskets.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total points from free throws. Yolanda averaged 4 free throws per game and there were 15 games in the season:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ free throws/game} \\times 15 \\text{ games} = 60 \\text{ free throws} \\]\nSince each free throw is worth 1 point, the total points from free throws is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ free throws} \\times 1 \\text{ point/free throw} = 60 \\text{ points} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total points from two-point baskets. Yolanda averaged 5 two-point baskets per game and there were 15 games in the season:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ two-point baskets/game} \\times 15 \\text{ games} = 75 \\text{ two-point baskets} \\]\nSince each two-point basket is worth 2 points, the total points from two-point baskets is:\n\\[ 75 \\text{ two-point baskets} \\times 2 \\text{ points/two-point basket} = 150 \\text{ points} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the points from free throws and two-point baskets from the total points to find the points from three-point baskets:\n\\[ 345 \\text{ total points} - 60 \\text{ points from free throws} - 150 \\text{ points from two-point baskets} = 135 \\text{ points from three-point baskets} \\]\nSince each three-point basket is worth 3 points, the total number of three-point baskets is:\n\\[ 135 \\text{ points from three-point baskets} \\div 3 \\text{ points/three-point basket} = 45 \\text{ three-point baskets} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the average number of three-point baskets per game by dividing the total number of three-point baskets by the number of games:\n\\[ 45 \\text{ three-point baskets} \\div 15 \\text{ games} = 3 \\text{ three-point baskets/game} \\]\n\nThus, Yolanda averaged \\(\\boxed{3}\\) three-point baskets per game.",
