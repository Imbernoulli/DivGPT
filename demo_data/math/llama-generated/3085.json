        "To determine how many minutes Larry spends on his dog each day, we need to break down the time he spends on different activities and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Larry spends walking and playing with his dog:\n- Larry spends half an hour twice a day.\n- Half an hour is equivalent to 30 minutes.\n- Therefore, twice a day he spends \\(30 \\text{ minutes} \\times 2 = 60 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Larry spends feeding his dog:\n- Larry spends a fifth of an hour each day.\n- A fifth of an hour is equivalent to \\(60 \\text{ minutes} \\div 5 = 12 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\nNow, we add the time spent on both activities:\n- Time spent walking and playing: 60 minutes\n- Time spent feeding: 12 minutes\n- Total time spent on his dog each day: \\(60 \\text{ minutes} + 12 \\text{ minutes} = 72 \\text{ minutes}\\)\n\nThus, Larry spends \\(\\boxed{72}\\) minutes on his dog each day.",

Larry spends a fifth of an hour every day on this activity. Therefore, the time spent feeding his dog is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent feeding} = \\frac{1}{5} \\text{ hour}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to convert these times from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time spent walking and playing to minutes as follows:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ hour} = 1 \\times 60 = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nAnd we can convert the time spent feeding to minutes as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\text{ hour} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 60 = 12 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the time spent on both activities to find the total time Larry spends on his dog each day:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time spent on dog} = 60 \\text{ minutes} + 12 \\text{ minutes} = 72 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of minutes Larry spends on his dog each day is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{72}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total time Larry spends on his dog each day, we need to consider both the time he spends walking and playing with his dog and the time he spends feeding his dog.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Larry spends walking and playing with his dog. Larry spends half an hour twice a day. Therefore, we can multiply the time spent per session by the number of sessions per day:\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent walking and playing with the dog} = 0.5 \\text{ hours/session} \\times 2 \\text{ sessions/day} = 1 \\text{ hour/day}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Larry spends feeding his dog. Larry spends a fifth of an hour every day. Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent feeding the dog} = \\frac{1}{5} \\text{ hour/day}\n\\]\n\nTo find the total time Larry spends on his dog each day, we add the time spent walking and playing with his dog to the time spent feeding his dog:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time spent on the dog} = 1 \\text{ hour/day} + \\frac{1}{5} \\text{ hour/day}\n\\]\n\nTo add these two quantities, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1 and 5 is 5. We can rewrite 1 hour as \\(\\frac{5}{5}\\) hour:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time spent on the dog} = \\frac{5}{5} \\text{ hour/day} + \\frac{1}{5} \\text{ hour/day} = \\frac{6}{5} \\text{ hour/day}\n\\]\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\) hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time spent on the dog} = \\frac{6}{5} \\times 60 = \\frac{360}{5} = 72 \\text{ minutes/day}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Larry spends on his dog each day is \\(\\boxed{72}\\) minutes.",
