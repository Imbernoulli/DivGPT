Determine the number of jelly beans left after Thomas takes his share.\n3. Find out how many jelly beans Barry and Emmanuel will share.\n4. Calculate the number of jelly beans Emmanuel gets based on the given ratio.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Thomas takes 10% of the 200 jelly beans.\n   \\[\n   10\\% \\text{ of } 200 = 0.10 \\times 200 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, Thomas takes 20 jelly beans.\n\n2. Subtract the number of jelly beans Thomas takes from the total number of jelly beans to find out how many are left.\n   \\[\n   200 - 20 = 180\n   \\]\n   So, there are 180 jelly beans left for Barry and Emmanuel to share.\n\n3. Barry and Emmanuel share the remaining jelly beans in the ratio 4:5. This means for every 9 parts (4 parts for Barry and 5 parts for Emmanuel), Emmanuel gets 5 parts. To find out how many jelly beans each part represents, we divide the remaining jelly beans by 9.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of jelly beans per part} = \\frac{180}{9} = 20\n   \\]\n   Since Emmanuel gets 5 parts, we multiply the number of jelly beans per part by 5.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of jelly beans Emmanuel gets} = 5 \\times 20 = 100\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Emmanuel gets \\boxed{100} jelly beans.",

Calculate the number of jelly beans Emmanuel gets based on the given ratio.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of jelly beans Thomas takes. Thomas takes 10% of the 200 jelly beans:\n\\[\n10\\% \\times 200 = \\frac{10}{100} \\times 200 = 20\n\\]\nSo, Thomas takes 20 jelly beans.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of jelly beans left after Thomas takes his share. The total number of jelly beans left is:\n\\[\n200 - 20 = 180\n\\]\nBarry and Emmanuel will share these 180 jelly beans in the ratio 4:5. To find out how many jelly beans each will get, we first need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio. The ratio 4:5 has a total of:\n\\[\n4 + 5 = 9\n\\]\n parts. Therefore, each part is:\n\\[\n\\frac{180}{9} = 20\n\\]\nSince Emmanuel's share corresponds to 5 parts, the number of jelly beans Emmanuel gets is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 20 = 100\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of jelly beans Emmanuel gets is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",

This means that for every 9 parts (4 parts for Barry and 5 parts for Emmanuel), Emmanuel gets 5 parts. To find out how many jelly beans each part represents, we divide the remaining jelly beans by 9:\n\\[ \\frac{180}{9} = 20 \\text{ jelly beans per part} \\]\n\nSince Emmanuel gets 5 parts, the number of jelly beans Emmanuel gets is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 20 = 100 \\text{ jelly beans} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of jelly beans Emmanuel gets is:\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]",
