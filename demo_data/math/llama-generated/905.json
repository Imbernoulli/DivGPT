        "To determine the running time of Beast of War: Armoured Command, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the running time of Millennium.\n2. Use the information given to find the running time of Alpha Epsilon.\n3. Use the information given to find the running time of Beast of War: Armoured Command.\n\nFirst, we know that Millennium runs for 2 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 2 hours into minutes:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Alpha Epsilon is 30 minutes shorter than Millennium. Therefore, we subtract 30 minutes from the running time of Millennium:\n\\[\n\\text{Running time of Alpha Epsilon} = 120 \\text{ minutes} - 30 \\text{ minutes} = 90 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThen, we know that Beast of War: Armoured Command is 10 minutes longer than Alpha Epsilon. Therefore, we add 10 minutes to the running time of Alpha Epsilon:\n\\[\n\\text{Running time of Beast of War: Armoured Command} = 90 \\text{ minutes} + 10 \\text{ minutes} = 100 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the running time of Beast of War: Armoured Command is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) minutes.",
