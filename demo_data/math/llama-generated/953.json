        "To determine how many students do not wear any vision assistance wear, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students who wear glasses.\n2. Calculate the number of students who wear contact lenses.\n3. Determine if there is any overlap between students who wear glasses and those who wear contact lenses. Since the problem does not specify any overlap, we will assume there is no overlap.\n4. Subtract the total number of students who wear either glasses or contact lenses from the total number of students.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students who wear glasses:\n   \\[\n   25\\% \\text{ of } 40 = 0.25 \\times 40 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, 10 students wear glasses.\n\n2. Calculate the number of students who wear contact lenses:\n   \\[\n   40\\% \\text{ of } 40 = 0.40 \\times 40 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, 16 students wear contact lenses.\n\n3. Since there is no overlap between students who wear glasses and those who wear contact lenses, the total number of students who wear either glasses or contact lenses is:\n   \\[\n   10 + 16 = 26\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract the total number of students who wear either glasses or contact lenses from the total number of students to find the number of students who do not wear any vision assistance wear:\n   \\[\n   40 - 26 = 14\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students who do not wear any vision assistance wear is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
