Divide the combined time for the last two videos by 2 to find the length of each video.\n\nLet's start by converting all times to seconds.\n\n- The first video is 2 minutes long. Since 1 minute = 60 seconds, we have:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ minutes} = 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n\n- The second video is 4 minutes and 30 seconds. Converting 4 minutes to seconds and adding 30 seconds, we get:\n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ minutes} = 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ minutes and 30 seconds} = 240 \\text{ seconds} + 30 \\text{ seconds} = 270 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total time spent on the first two videos:\n\\[\n120 \\text{ seconds} + 270 \\text{ seconds} = 390 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the time spent on the first two videos from the total time to find the combined time for the last two videos:\n\\[\n510 \\text{ seconds} - 390 \\text{ seconds} = 120 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nSince the last two videos are equal in length, we divide the combined time for the last two videos by 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{120 \\text{ seconds}}{2} = 60 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, each of the last two videos is \\boxed{60} seconds long.",
        "To determine the length of each of the last two YouTube videos, we first need to convert all the times into seconds.

Since there are two such videos, their total length is \\( 2x \\) seconds. According to the problem, the total time spent watching all four videos is 510 seconds.
