Subtract this total from the total number of pages printed to find the number of pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. **Pages that are crumpled:**\n   The printer crumples every seventh page. So, we need to find how many multiples of 7 are there between 1 and 42.\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 1 = 7, \\quad 7 \\times 2 = 14, \\quad 7 \\times 3 = 21, \\quad 7 \\times 4 = 28, \\quad 7 \\times 5 = 35, \\quad 7 \\times 6 = 42\n   \\]\n   There are 6 pages that are crumpled.\n\n2. **Pages that are blurred:**\n   The printer blurs every third page. So, we need to find how many multiples of 3 are there between 1 and 42.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 1 = 3, \\quad 3 \\times 2 = 6, \\quad 3 \\times 3 = 9, \\quad 3 \\times 4 = 12, \\quad 3 \\times 5 = 15, \\quad 3 \\times 6 = 18, \\quad 3 \\times 7 = 21, \\quad 3 \\times 8 = 24, \\quad 3 \\times 9 = 27, \\quad 3 \\times 10 = 30, \\quad 3 \\times 11 = 33, \\quad 3 \\times 12 = 36, \\quad 3 \\times 13 = 39, \\quad 3 \\times 14 = 42\n   \\]\n   There are 14 pages that are blurred.\n\n3. **Pages that are both crumpled and blurred:**\n   These are the pages that are multiples of both 7 and 3, which means they are multiples of the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 3. Since 7 and 3 are coprime, their LCM is \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\). So, we need to find how many multiples of 21 are there between 1 and 42.\n   \\[\n   21 \\times 1 = 21, \\quad 21 \\times 2 = 42\n   \\]\n   There are 2 pages that are both crumpled and blurred.\n\n4. **Total number of pages that are either crumpled or blurred:**\n   We add the number of crumpled pages and the number of blurred pages, and then subtract the number of pages that are both crumpled and blurred to avoid double-counting.\n   \\[\n   6 + 14 - 2 = 18\n   \\]\n\n5. **Number of pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred:**\n   We subtract the total number of pages that are either crumpled or blurred from the total number of pages printed.\n   \\[\n   42 - 18 = 24\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
