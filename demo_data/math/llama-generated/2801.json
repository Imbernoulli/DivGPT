        "To determine how many students are in the canteen, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students who are absent.\n2. Calculate the number of students who are present.\n3. Determine how many of the present students are in the classroom.\n4. Calculate how many of the present students are in the canteen.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of students who are absent.**\n\nThe total number of students in the class is 40. Since \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) of the students are absent, we can find the number of absent students by multiplying 40 by \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\):\n\\[\n40 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = 4\n\\]\nSo, there are 4 students absent.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of students who are present.**\n\nTo find the number of students who are present, we subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students:\n\\[\n40 - 4 = 36\n\\]\nSo, there are 36 students present.\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many of the present students are in the classroom.**\n\nSince \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the present students are in the classroom, we can find the number of students in the classroom by multiplying 36 by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\):\n\\[\n36 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 27\n\\]\nSo, there are 27 students in the classroom.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate how many of the present students are in the canteen.**\n\nTo find the number of students in the canteen, we subtract the number of students in the classroom from the number of students who are present:\n\\[\n36 - 27 = 9\n\\]\nSo, there are 9 students in the canteen.\n\nTherefore, the number of students in the canteen is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",

Calculate the number of students who are in the canteen.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of students who are absent. Since \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) of the 40 students are absent, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of absent students} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 40 = 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of students who are present. Since there are 40 students in total and 4 are absent, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of present students} = 40 - 4 = 36\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many of the present students are in the classroom. Since \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the present students are in the classroom, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students in the classroom} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 36 = 27\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of students who are in the canteen. Since the rest of the present students are in the canteen, we subtract the number of students in the classroom from the number of present students:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students in the canteen} = 36 - 27 = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students in the canteen is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
