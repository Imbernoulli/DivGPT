        "To determine how many sushi rolls James can make with the remaining fish, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of fish that have gone bad:**\n   James bought 400 fish and 20% of them have gone bad.\n   \\[\n   20\\% \\text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \\times 400 = 80\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of fish that are still good:**\n   Subtract the number of bad fish from the total number of fish he bought.\n   \\[\n   400 - 80 = 320\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of sushi rolls James can make:**\n   Each sushi roll requires 40 fish. Therefore, divide the number of good fish by the number of fish needed per sushi roll.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{320}{40} = 8\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of sushi rolls James can make with the remaining fish is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
