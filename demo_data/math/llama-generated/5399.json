Mason wants hot dogs, Noah insists on burgers, and Jacob thinks they should eat pies. They finally agree that everyone can eat whatever they want and they'll use the weight of the food to determine who wins. A hot dog weighs 2 ounces, a burger weighs 5 ounces, and a pie weighs 10 ounces. Jacob eats three fewer pies than Noah eats burgers. Mason eats 3 times as many hotdogs as the number of pies consumed by Jacob. If Noah ate 8 burgers, what is the total weight of the hotdogs that Mason ate?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total weight of the hotdogs that Mason ate, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how many pies Jacob ate.\n2. Determine how many hotdogs Mason ate.\n3. Calculate the total weight of the hotdogs Mason ate.\n\nFirst, we know that Noah ate 8 burgers. Since Jacob eats three fewer pies than Noah eats burgers, we can calculate the number of pies Jacob ate as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of pies Jacob ate} = 8 - 3 = 5 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Mason eats 3 times as many hotdogs as the number of pies consumed by Jacob. Therefore, we can calculate the number of hotdogs Mason ate as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of hotdogs Mason ate} = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\n\nSince each hotdog weighs 2 ounces, we can calculate the total weight of the hotdogs Mason ate as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Total weight of hotdogs Mason ate} = 15 \\times 2 = 30 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nThus, the total weight of the hotdogs that Mason ate is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
