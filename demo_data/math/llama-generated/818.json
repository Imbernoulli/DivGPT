Therefore, the number of fish Ken brought home is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fish Ken brought home} = 60 - 3 = 57\n\\]\n\nKendra did not release any fish, so the number of fish Kendra brought home is the same as the number of fish she caught:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fish Kendra brought home} = 30\n\\]\n\nTo find the total number of fish Ken and Kendra brought home, we add the number of fish each of them brought home:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of fish brought home} = 57 + 30 = 87\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of fish Ken and Kendra brought home is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{87}\n\\]",
