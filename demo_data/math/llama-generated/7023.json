        "To determine how many tears Trent cries, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of onions Trent needs to chop.\n2. Determine how many tears Trent cries per onion.\n3. Calculate the total number of tears.\n\nFirst, let's find out the total number of onions Trent needs to chop. Since he needs to chop 4 onions per pot of soup and he is making 6 pots of soup, we multiply the number of onions per pot by the number of pots:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ onions/pot} \\times 6 \\text{ pots} = 24 \\text{ onions} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Trent cries 2 tears for every 3 onions he chops. To find out how many tears he cries per onion, we divide 2 tears by 3 onions:\n\\[ \\frac{2 \\text{ tears}}{3 \\text{ onions}} \\]\n\nNow, to find the total number of tears, we multiply the total number of onions by the number of tears per onion:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ onions} \\times \\frac{2 \\text{ tears}}{3 \\text{ onions}} = 24 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 24 \\times 0.6667 = 16 \\text{ tears} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of tears Trent cries is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
        "To determine how many tears Trent cries, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of onions Trent needs to chop.\n2.

To find out how many tears he cries for 24 onions, we can set up a proportion:\n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\text{ tears}}{3 \\text{ onions}} = \\frac{x \\text{ tears}}{24 \\text{ onions}}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we can cross-multiply:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ tears} \\times 24 \\text{ onions} = 3 \\text{ onions} \\times x \\text{ tears}\n\\]\n\\[\n48 = 3x\n\\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{48}{3} = 16\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of tears Trent cries is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
        "To determine how many tears Trent cries, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of onions Trent needs to chop.\n2. Determine how many tears he cries per onion.\n3.
