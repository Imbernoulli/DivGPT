According to the problem, Carlos read 28 books in July and 30 books in August. Therefore, the total number of books he read in these two months is:\n\n\\[ 28 + 30 = 58 \\]\n\nCarlos needed to read 100 books in total during his summer vacation. Since he already read 58 books in July and August, the number of books he must have read in June is the difference between the total number of books he needed to read and the number of books he has already read. This can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ 100 - 58 = 42 \\]\n\nThus, the number of books Carlos read in June is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",

Carlos has already read 28 books in July and 30 books in August. Let's denote the number of books Carlos read in June as \\( x \\).\n\nThe total number of books read over the three months (June, July, and August) should equal 100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\nx + 28 + 30 = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine the numbers for July and August:\n\\[\nx + 58 = 100\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 58 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nx = 100 - 58\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 42\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of books Carlos read in June is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",
