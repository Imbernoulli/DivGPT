        "To determine the total number of blocks Pete traveled, we need to break down his journey into smaller segments and then sum them up.\n\n1. Pete walked from his house to the bus garage, which is 5 blocks.\n2. Pete rode the bus from the bus garage to the post office, which is 20 blocks.\n3. Pete returned home by the same route, so he rode the bus from the post office to the bus garage, which is 20 blocks, and then walked from the bus garage to his house, which is 5 blocks.\n\nNow, let's add up all the blocks traveled:\n- Walking to the bus garage: 5 blocks\n- Riding the bus to the post office: 20 blocks\n- Riding the bus back to the bus garage: 20 blocks\n- Walking back home: 5 blocks\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[ 5 + 20 + 20 + 5 = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of blocks Pete traveled is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
