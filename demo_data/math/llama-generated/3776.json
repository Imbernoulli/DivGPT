        "To determine how many flowers James planted in a day, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the total number of people planting flowers:**\n   James and his 4 friends make a total of:\n   \\[\n   1 + 4 = 5 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of flowers planted by each person:**\n   The total number of flowers planted by all 5 people in 2 days is 200. Therefore, the number of flowers planted by each person in 2 days is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{200}{5} = 40 \\text{ flowers per person}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of flowers planted by each person in one day:**\n   Since each person planted 40 flowers in 2 days, the number of flowers planted by each person in one day is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\text{ flowers per person per day}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of flowers James planted in a day is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
