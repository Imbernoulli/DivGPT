        "To determine how many days it takes the sprinkler system to use 50 liters of water, we need to calculate the total amount of water used by the sprinkler system in one day and then find out how many days it takes to reach 50 liters.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of water used by the sprinkler system in one day:\n- In the morning, the sprinkler uses 4 liters of water.\n- In the evening, the sprinkler uses 6 liters of water.\n\nAdding these amounts together gives:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ liters} + 6 \\text{ liters} = 10 \\text{ liters per day}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days it takes to use 50 liters of water.
