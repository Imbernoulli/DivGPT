        "To determine how long one notepad would last if someone wrote 10 notes per day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of smaller note papers Alissa can get from one piece of letter-size paper:**\n   - Alissa folds each piece of paper 3 times.\n   - Each fold reduces the size of the paper by half.\n   - After the first fold, the paper is divided into 2 parts.\n   - After the second fold, each of those parts is divided again, resulting in 4 parts.\n   - After the third fold, each of those 4 parts is divided again, resulting in 8 parts.\n   - Therefore, one piece of letter-size paper yields \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) smaller note papers.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of smaller note papers Alissa can get from 5 pieces of letter-size paper:**\n   - Since each piece of paper yields 8 smaller note papers, 5 pieces will yield:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 8 = 40 \\text{ smaller note papers}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how long one notepad will last if someone writes 10 notes per day:**\n   - If one notepad contains 40 smaller note papers and someone writes 10 notes per day, the notepad will last:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{10} = 4 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\nThus, one notepad would last \\(\\boxed{4}\\) days.",
