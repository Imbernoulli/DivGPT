The problem states that Smith’s Bakery sold 6 more than four times the number of pies that Mcgee’s Bakery sold. We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\n\\[ S = 4M + 6 \\]\n\nwhere \\( S \\) is the number of pies Smith’s Bakery sold. Substituting the value of \\( M \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ S = 4(16) + 6 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 4 \\times 16 \\):\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 16 = 64 \\]\n\nThen, we add 6 to 64:\n\n\\[ 64 + 6 = 70 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pies Smith’s Bakery sold is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]",
