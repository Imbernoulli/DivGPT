        "First, let's calculate the total cost of the cameras for both Maddox and Theo. Since each camera costs $20 and they each bought 3 cameras, the total cost for each person is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 20 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cameras for Maddox. Maddox sold each camera for $28, so his total revenue is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 28 = 84 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cameras for Theo. Theo sold each camera for $23, so his total revenue is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 23 = 69 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the profit for each person by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. Maddox's profit is:\n\\[\n84 - 60 = 24 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTheo's profit is:\n\\[\n69 - 60 = 9 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference in profit between Maddox and Theo:\n\\[\n24 - 9 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, Maddox got \\(\\boxed{15}\\) dollars more profit from the sale of his cameras than Theo.",

        "To determine how much more profit Maddox made compared to Theo, we need to calculate the profit each of them made and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the cameras for each person. Since both Maddox and Theo bought 3 polaroid cameras at $20 each, the total cost for each person is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 20 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate Maddox's total revenue from selling his cameras. Maddox sold each camera for $28, so his total revenue is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 28 = 84 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nThe profit Maddox made is the total revenue minus the total cost:\n\\[\n84 - 60 = 24 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate Theo's total revenue from selling his cameras. Theo sold each camera for $23, so his total revenue is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 23 = 69 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nThe profit Theo made is the total revenue minus the total cost:\n\\[\n69 - 60 = 9 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference in profit between Maddox and Theo:\n\\[\n24 - 9 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, Maddox made \\(\\boxed{15}\\) dollars more profit than Theo.",
