        "Let's define the scores of the three bowlers as follows:\n- Let the score of the third bowler be \\( x \\).\n- Since the second bowler scored 3 times as high as the third bowler, the score of the second bowler is \\( 3x \\).\n- Since the first bowler scored \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) as many points as the second bowler, the score of the first bowler is \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 3x = x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the total score of the three bowlers is 810 points. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\\[ x + 3x + x = 810 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 5x = 810 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\\[ x = \\frac{810}{5} = 162 \\]\n\nThus, the score of the third bowler is \\(\\boxed{162}\\).",
