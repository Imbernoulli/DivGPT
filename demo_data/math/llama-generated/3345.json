        "To determine how much money Jack has remaining, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the $100 he initially had.

Therefore, the cost for half a pound of cheese is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ pound} \\times \\$10 \\text{ per pound} = \\$5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount spent:**\n   Adding up the costs of the initial bottles of water, the additional bottles of water, and the cheese, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\$8 + \\$16 + \\$5 = \\$29\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the remaining money:**\n   Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Jack had:\n   \\[\n   \\$100 - \\$29 = \\$71\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Jack has remaining is \\(\\boxed{71}\\).",

Subtract the total cost from Jack's initial amount of money.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the initial 4 bottles of water:**\n   Each bottle costs $2, so the cost for 4 bottles is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many additional bottles of water Jack needs to buy:**\n   Jack's mother asked him to buy twice as many bottles as he already bought. Since he bought 4 bottles initially, he needs to buy:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the additional bottles of water:**\n   Each bottle costs $2, so the cost for 8 bottles is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 2 = 16 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the cost of the half pound of cheese:**\n   The cost of 1 pound of cheese is $10, so the cost for half a pound is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Sum up all the costs:**\n   The total cost is the sum of the cost of the initial 4 bottles of water, the cost of the additional 8 bottles of water, and the cost of the half pound of cheese:\n   \\[\n   8 + 16 + 5 = 29 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Subtract the total cost from Jack's initial amount of money:**\n   Jack started with $100, so after spending $29, he has:\n   \\[\n   100 - 29 = 71 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Jack has remaining is \\(\\boxed{71}\\).",

After spending $29, the remaining amount is:\n   \\[\n   100 - 29 = 71 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Jack has remaining is \\(\\boxed{71}\\).",
