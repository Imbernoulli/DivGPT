So, we multiply 400 by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\):\n\\[\n400 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 400 \\times 0.75 = 300\n\\]\nTherefore, Wally gives 300 tickets to his friends.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of tickets Jensen and Finley receive based on their ratio.**\n\nThe ratio of tickets between Jensen and Finley is 4:11. This means that for every 4 tickets Jensen gets, Finley gets 11 tickets. The total number of parts in the ratio is \\(4 + 11 = 15\\). So, we need to find out how many tickets correspond to one part. We do this by dividing the total number of tickets by the total number of parts:\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{15} = 20\n\\]\nThis means that each part of the ratio corresponds to 20 tickets.
