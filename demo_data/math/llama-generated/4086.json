        "To determine the total number of kids in camp, let's break down the information given and solve it step by step.\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of kids in camp.\n2. Half of the kids are going to soccer camp. Therefore, the number of kids going to soccer camp is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\).\n3. One-fourth of the kids going to soccer camp are going to soccer camp in the morning.

The rest of the kids going to soccer camp are going to soccer camp in the afternoon. Since the total number of kids going to soccer camp is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) and the number of kids going to soccer camp in the morning is \\( \\frac{x}{8} \\), the number of kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon is \\( \\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{x}{8} \\).\n\nTo subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 2 and 8 is 8. So, we can rewrite \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) as \\( \\frac{4x}{8} \\). Therefore, the number of kids going to soccer camp in the afternoon is:\n\\[ \\frac{4x}{8} - \\frac{x}{8} = \\frac{3x}{8} \\]\n\nWe are given that 750 kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\frac{3x}{8} = 750 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we need to isolate \\( x \\). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\), which is \\( \\frac{8}{3} \\):\n\\[ x = 750 \\times \\frac{8}{3} \\]\n\nNow, we perform the multiplication:\n\\[ x = 750 \\times \\frac{8}{3} = 750 \\times \\frac{8}{3} = 750 \\times \\frac{8}{3} = 750 \\times 2.6667 = 2000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of kids in camp is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2000} \\]",
