        "To determine how much Katie and her family spend on coffee, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of donuts eaten.\n2. Determine the total amount of coffee needed.\n3. Calculate the number of pots of coffee required.\n4. Compute the total cost of the coffee.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of donuts eaten.**\n\nThe family finishes 3 dozen donuts. Since one dozen equals 12 donuts, we have:\n\\[ 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\text{ donuts} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total amount of coffee needed.**\n\nEach donut requires 2 ounces of coffee. Therefore, for 36 donuts, the total amount of coffee needed is:\n\\[ 36 \\times 2 = 72 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of pots of coffee required.**\n\nEach pot of coffee contains 12 ounces. To find out how many pots are needed for 72 ounces, we divide the total amount of coffee by the amount each pot contains:\n\\[ 72 \\div 12 = 6 \\text{ pots} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Compute the total cost of the coffee.**\n\nEach pot of coffee costs $3 to make. Therefore, the total cost for 6 pots is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount spent on coffee is \\(\\boxed{18}\\)."
