        "To determine how many more people watched the games this week than last week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of people who watched the first game.\n2. Calculate the number of people who watched the third game.\n3. Find the total number of people who watched the games this week.\n4. Subtract the total number of people who watched the games last week from the total number of people who watched the games this week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of people who watched the first game. We know that 20 fewer people watched the first game than the second game. Since 80 people watched the second game, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Number of people who watched the first game} = 80 - 20 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of people who watched the third game. We know that 15 more people watched the third game than the second game. Since 80 people watched the second game, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Number of people who watched the third game} = 80 + 15 = 95 \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total number of people who watched the games this week. We add the number of people who watched each game:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of people who watched the games this week} = 60 + 80 + 95 = 235 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of people who watched the games last week from the total number of people who watched the games this week:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 235 - 200 = 35 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people who watched the games this week than last week is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",
