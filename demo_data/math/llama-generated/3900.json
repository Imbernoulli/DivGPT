        "To determine the number of shark sightings in Cape May, we start by letting \\( x \\) represent the number of shark sightings in Cape May. According to the problem, Daytona Beach has 5 more than triple the number of shark sightings as Cape May. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n\n\\[ 26 = 3x + 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve for \\( x \\). First, we isolate the term involving \\( x \\) by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 26 - 5 = 3x \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 21 = 3x \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{21}{3} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ x = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of shark sightings in Cape May is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
