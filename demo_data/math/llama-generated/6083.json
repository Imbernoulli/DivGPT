        "To determine Umar's age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Yusaf's age:**\n   - Ali turned 8 years old this year.\n   - Ali is 3 years older than Yusaf.\n   - Therefore, Yusaf's age is:\n     \\[\n     8 - 3 = 5\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine Umar's age:**\n   - Umar is twice Yusaf’s age.\n   - Since Yusaf is 5 years old, Umar's age is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 5 = 10\n     \\]\n\nThus, Umar is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) years old.",
        "To determine Umar's age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out Yusaf's age.\n2.
