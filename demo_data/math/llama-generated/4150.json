Each crate can weigh up to 20kg and he has 15 crates he can fill. He has 4 bags of nails to load, each of which weighs 5kg; he has 12 bags of hammers, each of which weighs 5 kg; he also has 10 bags of wooden planks, each of which weighs 30kg and can be sub-divided. He realizes that he has too much to load and will have to leave some items out of the crates to meet the weight limit. In kg, how much is Daryl going to have to leave out of the crates?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how much Daryl is going to have to leave out of the crates, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the items he has. We start by calculating the weight of each type of item:\n\n- The total weight of the nails is \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\) kg.\n- The total weight of the hammers is \\(12 \\times 5 = 60\\) kg.\n- The total weight of the wooden planks is \\(10 \\times 30 = 300\\) kg.\n\nAdding these together gives the total weight of all the items:\n\\[20 + 60 + 300 = 380 \\text{ kg}\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the maximum weight that Daryl can load into the crates. Since each crate can hold up to 20 kg and he has 15 crates, the total maximum weight is:\n\\[15 \\times 20 = 300 \\text{ kg}\\]\n\nSince the total weight of the items is 380 kg and the maximum weight that can be loaded is 300 kg, Daryl will have to leave out:\n\\[380 - 300 = 80 \\text{ kg}\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of weight Daryl is going to have to leave out of the crates is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
