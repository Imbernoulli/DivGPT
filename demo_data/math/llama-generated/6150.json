        "To determine how many berries Stacy has, we start by defining the number of berries each person has in terms of a variable. Let's define the number of berries Skylar has as \\( x \\). According to the problem, Steve has double the number of berries that Skylar has, so Steve has \\( 2x \\) berries. Stacy has 4 times as many berries as Steve, so Stacy has \\( 4 \\times 2x = 8x \\) berries.\n\nThe total number of berries Stacy, Steve, and Skylar have is given as 1100. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\nx + 2x + 8x = 1100\n\\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[\n11x = 1100\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1100}{11} = 100\n\\]\nSo, Skylar has 100 berries. Since Steve has double the number of berries that Skylar has, Steve has:\n\\[\n2x = 2 \\times 100 = 200\n\\]\nAnd since Stacy has 4 times as many berries as Steve, Stacy has:\n\\[\n8x = 8 \\times 100 = 800\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of berries Stacy has is \\(\\boxed{800}\\).",
