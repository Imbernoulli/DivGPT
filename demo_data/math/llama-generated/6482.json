        "To determine how many peaches Brenda has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of fresh peaches.\n2. Subtract the number of peaches that are thrown away for being too small.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of fresh peaches. Brenda picks 250 peaches and only 60% of them are fresh. So, we multiply 250 by 60% (which is the same as multiplying by 0.60):\n\\[\n250 \\times 0.60 = 150\n\\]\nThis means Brenda has 150 fresh peaches.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of peaches that are thrown away for being too small. Brenda has to throw away 15 peaches. So, we subtract 15 from 150:\n\\[\n150 - 15 = 135\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of peaches Brenda has left is \\boxed{135}.",
        "First, we need to determine how many of the 250 peaches are fresh. Since 60% of the peaches are fresh, we calculate 60% of 250 as follows:\n\n\\[ 250 \\times 0.60 = 150 \\]\n\nSo, Brenda has 150 fresh peaches. Next, we need to account for the 15 peaches that Brenda throws away because they are too small. We subtract 15 from the 150 fresh peaches:\n\n\\[ 150 - 15 = 135 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of peaches Brenda has left is \\(\\boxed{135}\\).",
