        "To determine Antonio's current age in months, we start by finding out Isabella's current age. We know that in 18 months, Isabella will be 10 years old. First, we convert 10 years into months:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ years} = 10 \\times 12 = 120 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nSince this is her age in 18 months, we subtract 18 months from 120 months to find her current age:\n\n\\[ 120 - 18 = 102 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nIsabella is currently 102 months old.
