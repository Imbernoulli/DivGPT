        "To determine how long it would take Moe to eat 800 pieces of cuttlebone, we start by finding out how long it takes him to eat one piece. Since Moe takes 10 seconds to eat 40 pieces, we can calculate the time it takes to eat one piece by dividing 10 seconds by 40 pieces:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10 \\text{ seconds}}{40 \\text{ pieces}} = \\frac{10}{40} = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ seconds per piece}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it would take Moe to eat 800 pieces. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to eat one piece by 800 pieces:\n\n\\[\n800 \\text{ pieces} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ seconds per piece} = 800 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 200 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it would take Moe \\boxed{200} seconds to eat 800 pieces of cuttlebone.",
