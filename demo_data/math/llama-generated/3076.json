        "To determine the number of students in the third group (13 years and above), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students under 11 years.\n2. Calculate the number of students above 11 but under 13 years.\n3. Subtract the sum of the students in the first two groups from the total number of students to find the number of students in the third group.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of students under 11 years. Since a third of the class is under 11 years, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students under 11 years} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 45 = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of students above 11 but under 13 years. Since two-fifths of the class are above 11 but under 13 years, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students above 11 but under 13 years} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 45 = 18\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the total number of students in the first two groups:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of students in the first two groups} = 15 + 18 = 33\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of students in the first two groups from the total number of students to find the number of students in the third group:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students 13 years and above} = 45 - 33 = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students in the third group is \\boxed{12}.",
