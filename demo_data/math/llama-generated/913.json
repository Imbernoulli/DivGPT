        "To determine the total number of daisies Jack has, we need to find the number of each type of daisy and then sum them up. We are given the following information:\n\n1. There are nine times as many pink daisies as white daisies.\n2. There are three less than four times as many red daisies as pink daisies.\n3. There are 6 white daisies.\n\nLet's start by calculating the number of pink daisies. Since there are nine times as many pink daisies as white daisies, we multiply the number of white daisies by 9:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pink daisies} = 9 \\times 6 = 54\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of red daisies. There are three less than four times as many red daisies as pink daisies. First, we find four times the number of pink daisies:\n\\[\n4 \\times 54 = 216\n\\]\nThen, we subtract 3 from this result:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red daisies} = 216 - 3 = 213\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of white, pink, and red daisies to find the total number of daisies:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of daisies} = 6 + 54 + 213 = 273\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of daisies is \\(\\boxed{273}\\).",
