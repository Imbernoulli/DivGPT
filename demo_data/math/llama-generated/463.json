So, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\text{Initial dolls} + 7 = 19 + 2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Initial dolls} + 7 = 21 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Initial dolls} = 21 - 7 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Initial dolls} = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, after receiving the dolls, Andrena has:\n\\[ 14 + 7 = 21 \\text{ dolls} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more dolls Andrena has now than Debelyn. Debelyn has 18 dolls, and Andrena has 21 dolls. The difference is:\n\\[ 21 - 18 = 3 \\]\n\nSo, Andrena has \\(\\boxed{3}\\) more dolls now than Debelyn.",
