        "To determine the total number of plates Tom and his guests use while they are at Tom's house for 4 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of people:**\n   - Tom invites his parents, which is 2 people.\n   - Tom invites 3 siblings.\n   - Tom himself is also included.\n   - Therefore, the total number of people is:\n     \\[\n     2 + 3 + 1 = 6\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of meals each person eats per day:**\n   - Each person eats 3 times a day.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of meals each person eats over 4 days:**\n   - Each person eats:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ meals/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 12 \\text{ meals}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of plates each person uses per meal:**\n   - Each person uses 2 plates per meal.\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of plates each person uses over 4 days:**\n   - Each person uses:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ meals} \\times 2 \\text{ plates/meal} = 24 \\text{ plates}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total number of plates used by all the people over 4 days:**\n   - Total plates used is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ people} \\times 24 \\text{ plates/person} = 144 \\text{ plates}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of plates Tom and his guests use while they are there for 4 days is \\boxed{144}.",
        "To determine the total number of plates Tom and his guests use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people present.\n2. Determine the number of meals each person eats in 4 days.\n3. Calculate the total number of plates used per person.\n4. Sum the plates used by all the people.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of people present. Tom invites his parents (2 people) and his 3 siblings, so the total number of people is:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of meals each person eats in 4 days. Since each person eats 3 times a day, in 4 days each person eats:\n\\[ 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ meals} \\]\n\nEach person uses 2 plates per meal, so the total number of plates used by each person in 4 days is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 2 = 24 \\text{ plates} \\]\n\nNow, we sum the plates used by all the people. Since there are 6 people and each person uses 24 plates, the total number of plates used is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 24 = 144 \\text{ plates} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of plates Tom and his guests use while they are there for the 4 days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{144} \\]",

Find the total number of plates used by all the people in the party.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of people at the party. Tom invites his parents (2 people) and 3 siblings, so the total number of people is:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \\text{ (Tom)} + 2 \\text{ (parents)} + 3 \\text{ (siblings)} = 6 + 2 + 3 = 6 + 6 = 8 \\text{ people in total} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of meals each person eats in 4 days.

Since each person uses 2 plates per meal, in 4 days each person uses:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ meals} \\times 2 \\text{ plates/meal} = 24 \\text{ plates} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the total number of plates used by all the people in the party.
