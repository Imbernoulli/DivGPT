        "To determine the new total cost of buying ten oranges and ten mangoes after a 15% price increase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the new price of one orange.\n2. Calculate the new price of one mango.\n3. Calculate the total cost for ten oranges.\n4. Calculate the total cost for ten mangoes.\n5. Add the total costs of ten oranges and ten mangoes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the new price of one orange. The original price of an orange is $40. A 15% increase means we add 15% of $40 to the original price:\n\\[\n\\text{New price of one orange} = 40 + 0.15 \\times 40 = 40 + 6 = 46\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the new price of one mango. The original price of a mango is $50. A 15% increase means we add 15% of $50 to the original price:\n\\[\n\\text{New price of one mango} = 50 + 0.15 \\times 50 = 50 + 7.5 = 57.5\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for ten oranges. Since each orange now costs $46, the total cost for ten oranges is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost for ten oranges} = 10 \\times 46 = 460\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost for ten mangoes. Since each mango now costs $57.5, the total cost for ten mangoes is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost for ten mangoes} = 10 \\times 57.5 = 575\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's add the total costs of ten oranges and ten mangoes to find the new total cost:\n\\[\n\\text{New total cost} = 460 + 575 = 1035\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost now to buy ten oranges and ten mangoes at the new prices is \\boxed{1035}.",
