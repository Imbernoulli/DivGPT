Francie's total savings from the next 6 weeks:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 6 \\text{ weeks} = 36 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. Francie's total savings by adding the amounts from the two periods:\n   \\[\n   40 \\text{ dollars} + 36 \\text{ dollars} = 76 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. Francie spends half of the money on new clothes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{76 \\text{ dollars}}{2} = 38 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. The remaining money after buying new clothes:\n   \\[\n   76 \\text{ dollars} - 38 \\text{ dollars} = 38 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. Francie subtracts the cost of the video game from the remaining money:\n   \\[\n   38 \\text{ dollars} - 35 \\text{ dollars} = 3 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Francie has remaining after buying the video game is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
