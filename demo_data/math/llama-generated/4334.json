Add the cost of the silverware and the cost of the dinner plates to get the total amount paid.\n\nFirst, we know that the silverware costs $20.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost of the dinner plates. The problem states that the dinner plates cost 50% as much as the silverware. Therefore, we multiply the cost of the silverware by 50% (or 0.50):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of dinner plates} = 20 \\times 0.50 = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the silverware and the cost of the dinner plates to find the total amount paid:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount paid} = 20 + 10 = 30\n\\]\n\nSo, the total amount John paid for everything is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
