        "To determine how many days the meat will last for the lion and the tiger, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of meat consumed by both the lion and the tiger in one day.\n2. Divide the total amount of meat available by the total amount of meat consumed in one day.\n\nFirst, let's find the total amount of meat consumed by both the lion and the tiger in one day. The lion consumes 25 kilograms of meat per day, and the tiger consumes 20 kilograms of meat per day. Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed in one day is:\n\\[ 25 + 20 = 45 \\text{ kilograms} \\]\n\nNext, we divide the total amount of meat available by the total amount of meat consumed in one day. The zoo has 90 kilograms of meat. So, we divide 90 by 45:\n\\[ 90 \\div 45 = 2 \\]\n\nThis means that the meat will last for 2 days. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",

        "To determine how many days the meat will last for the lion and the tiger, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of meat consumed by both the lion and the tiger in one day.\n2. Divide the total amount of meat available by the daily consumption to find out how many days the meat will last.\n\nFirst, let's find the total daily consumption of meat by the lion and the tiger:\n- The lion consumes 25 kilograms of meat per day.\n- The tiger consumes 20 kilograms of meat per day.\n- Therefore, the total daily consumption is \\(25 + 20 = 45\\) kilograms.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many days 90 kilograms of meat will last if they consume 45 kilograms per day:\n- We do this by dividing the total amount of meat by the daily consumption: \\(90 \\div 45 = 2\\).\n\nSo, the meat will last for \\(\\boxed{2}\\) days.",
