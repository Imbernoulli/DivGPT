        "To determine how many kilograms of tomatoes Ashley needs to make 5 liters of ketchup, we can use a proportion based on the given information.\n\nFirst, let's set up the proportion. We know that 69 kg of tomatoes are needed for 3 liters of ketchup. We want to find out how many kilograms of tomatoes are needed for 5 liters of ketchup. Let \\( x \\) be the number of kilograms of tomatoes needed for 5 liters of ketchup.\n\nThe proportion can be written as:\n\\[\n\\frac{69 \\text{ kg}}{3 \\text{ liters}} = \\frac{x \\text{ kg}}{5 \\text{ liters}}\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by cross-multiplying:\n\\[\n69 \\text{ kg} \\times 5 \\text{ liters} = 3 \\text{ liters} \\times x \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n345 \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{liters} = 3 \\text{ liters} \\cdot x \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3 liters:\n\\[\nx \\text{ kg} = \\frac{345 \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{liters}}{3 \\text{ liters}}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side:\n\\[\nx \\text{ kg} = 115 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Ashley needs \\(\\boxed{115}\\) kilograms of tomatoes to make 5 liters of ketchup.",
