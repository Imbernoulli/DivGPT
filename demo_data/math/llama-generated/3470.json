        "To determine how many hours Carl will drive in two weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of hours Carl drives in one day. According to the problem, he drives for 2 hours each day.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of hours Carl drives in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily driving hours by 7:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 14 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nAfter his promotion, Carl needs to drive for an additional 6 hours each week. Therefore, we add these extra hours to his weekly driving hours:\n\\[ 14 \\text{ hours/week} + 6 \\text{ hours/week} = 20 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many hours Carl drives in two weeks. We multiply the weekly driving hours by 2:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 40 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Carl will drive in two weeks is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
