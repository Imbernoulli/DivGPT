        "To determine the difference in the weight of Bill's labrador puppy and dachshund puppy at the end of the year, we need to calculate the weight gain for each dog and then find the difference in their final weights.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the weight gain for the labrador puppy:\n- The labrador puppy starts at 40 pounds.\n- It gains 25% of its starting weight over the year.\n- The weight gain is \\(40 \\times 0.25 = 10\\) pounds.\n- Therefore, the final weight of the labrador puppy is \\(40 + 10 = 50\\) pounds.\n\nNext, let's calculate the weight gain for the dachshund puppy:\n- The dachshund puppy starts at 12 pounds.\n- It gains 25% of its starting weight over the year.\n- The weight gain is \\(12 \\times 0.25 = 3\\) pounds.\n- Therefore, the final weight of the dachshund puppy is \\(12 + 3 = 15\\) pounds.\n\nNow, we find the difference in their final weights:\n- The final weight of the labrador puppy is 50 pounds.\n- The final weight of the dachshund puppy is 15 pounds.\n- The difference in their weight is \\(50 - 15 = 35\\) pounds.\n\nThus, the difference in their weight at the end of the year is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",
