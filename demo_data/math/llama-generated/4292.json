        "To find the largest of three consecutive integers that sum to 18, we can start by defining the integers in terms of a variable. Let's denote the smallest integer by \\( x \\). Since the integers are consecutive, the next integer will be \\( x + 1 \\) and the third integer will be \\( x + 2 \\).\n\nThe sum of these three integers is given by:\n\\[ x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 18 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 3x + 3 = 18 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3x = 15 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nNow that we know the smallest integer is 5, we can find the other two integers. The second integer is \\( x + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \\), and the third integer is \\( x + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7 \\).\n\nThe largest of these three integers is 7. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]",
