He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece.

Since Manny eats 1 piece, Kai will eat:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 1 = 2 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Raphael's Consumption:**\n   Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does. Since Manny eats 1 piece, Raphael will eat:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = 0.5 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Lisa's Consumption:**\n   Lisa loves lasagna and will eat 2 pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Raphael has 0.5 pieces, so Lisa will eat:\n   \\[\n   2 + 0.5 = 2.5 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the pieces eaten by each person:\n\\[\n1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 = 6 \\text{ pieces}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Manny should cut his lasagna into \\(\\boxed{6}\\) pieces.",
