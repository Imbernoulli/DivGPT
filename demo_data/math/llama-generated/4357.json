        "To determine the number of lines each character has, we start by defining variables for the number of lines each character has. Let's say the second character has \\( x \\) lines. According to the problem, the third character has 2 lines, and the second character has six more than three times the number of lines the third character has. We can express this relationship with the equation:\n\n\\[ x = 3 \\cdot 2 + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12 \\]\n\nSo, the second character has 12 lines. The first character has eight more lines than the second character, so we can express the number of lines the first character has as:\n\n\\[ x + 8 = 12 + 8 = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the first character has \\(\\boxed{20}\\) lines.",
