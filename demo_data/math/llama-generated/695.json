Each minute the temperature of the water increases by 3 degrees. Once the water reaches 212 degrees and is boiling, Jason needs to cook his pasta for 12 minutes. Then it will take him 1/3 that long to mix the pasta with the sauce and make a salad. How many minutes does it take Jason to cook dinner?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
