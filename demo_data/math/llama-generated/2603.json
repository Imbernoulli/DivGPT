The face cards are Jacks, Queens, and Kings, and there are 3 face cards per suit, so there are \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) face cards in total. Additionally, there are 4 cards with the number 8 (one for each suit). Therefore, the total number of cards removed from the deck is \\(12 + 4 = 16\\).\n\nThis leaves \\(52 - 16 = 36\\) cards in the deck.

Therefore, the total number of red cards left in the deck is \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\).\n\nNext, we need to determine how many of these red cards have a number divisible by 3. The numbers on the cards are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and A (which we can consider as 1). The numbers divisible by 3 are 3, 6, and 9. So, there are 3 numbers per suit that are divisible by 3.

Each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) has 13 cards, including 3 face cards (Jack, Queen, King) and 1 card with the number 8. Therefore, each suit has \\(13 - 3 - 1 = 9\\) cards left.\n\nSince there are 2 suits that are red (hearts and diamonds), the total number of red cards left is:\n\\[9 \\text{ cards/suit} \\times 2 \\text{ suits} = 18 \\text{ red cards}\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these red cards have a number divisible by 3. The numbers on a standard deck that are divisible by 3 are 3, 6, and 9. Since we removed the face cards and the 8's, the only numbers left are 3, 6, and 9. Therefore, each red suit has 3 cards with numbers divisible by 3.\n\nSince there are 2 suits that are red, the total number of red cards with numbers divisible by 3 is:\n\\[3 \\text{ cards/suit} \\times 2 \\text{ suits} = 6 \\text{ red cards}\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of drawing a card that is both red and has a number divisible by 3. The probability \\(P\\) is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of cards in the modified deck:\n\\[P = \\frac{6 \\text{ red cards}}{36 \\text{ cards}} = \\frac{1}{6}\\]\n\nMark picks a card at random and replaces it 36 times. The expected number of times he will pick a card that is both red and has a number divisible by 3 is given by the product of the probability and the number of trials:\n\\[E = P \\times 36 = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 36 = 6\\]\n\nTherefore, the expected number of times Mark should pick a card that is both red and has a number divisible by 3 is:\n\\[\\boxed{6}\\]",
        "To determine how many times Marcus should expect to pick a card that's both red and has a number divisible by 3, we start by identifying the composition of the modified deck.\n\nA standard deck has 52 cards, including 12 face cards (Jack, Queen, King of each suit) and 4 cards with the number 8 (one for each suit). Therefore, the total number of cards removed is \\(12 + 4 = 16\\). This leaves \\(52 - 16 = 36\\) cards in the deck.\n\nNext, we identify the cards that are both red and have a number divisible by 3. In a standard deck, the red cards are the hearts and diamonds. The numbers on the cards that are divisible by 3 are 3, 6, and 9. Thus, the red cards that have a number divisible by 3 are the 3 of hearts, 6 of hearts, 9 of hearts, 3 of diamonds, 6 of diamonds, and 9 of diamonds. This gives us a total of 6 cards.\n\nThe probability of drawing one of these cards from the modified deck is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is \\(\\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nSince Marcus replaces the card each time he picks, the probability remains the same for each draw.

Therefore, the red cards that have a number divisible by 3 are:\n   - Hearts: 3, 6, 9 (3 cards)\n   - Diamonds: 3, 6, 9 (3 cards)\n   So, the total number of red cards that have a number divisible by 3 is:\n   \\[\n   3 + 3 = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of picking a card that's both red and has a number divisible by 3.**\n\n   The probability \\( P \\) of picking such a card is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the expected number of times Marcus will pick a card that's both red and has a number divisible by 3 in 36 trials.**\n\n   The expected number of times \\( E \\) is the probability of the event multiplied by the number of trials:\n   \\[\n   E = P \\times 36 = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 36 = 6\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Marcus should expect to pick a card that's both red and has a number divisible by 3 \\(\\boxed{6}\\) times.",
