Determine how many 200-kilobyte videos can be stored with the remaining storage space.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the storage space required for 400 photos. Since each photo is 1.5 kilobytes in size, we have:\n\\[ 400 \\text{ photos} \\times 1.5 \\text{ kilobytes/photo} = 600 \\text{ kilobytes} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the storage space used by the photos from the total storage capacity of the drive. The drive can store 2000 photos, and each photo is 1.5 kilobytes, so the total storage capacity is:\n\\[ 2000 \\text{ photos} \\times 1.5 \\text{ kilobytes/photo} = 3000 \\text{ kilobytes} \\]\n\nAfter removing the storage space used by the 400 photos, the remaining storage space is:\n\\[ 3000 \\text{ kilobytes} - 600 \\text{ kilobytes} = 2400 \\text{ kilobytes} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many 200-kilobyte videos can be stored with the remaining 2400 kilobytes. We do this by dividing the remaining storage space by the size of each video:\n\\[ 2400 \\text{ kilobytes} \\div 200 \\text{ kilobytes/video} = 12 \\text{ videos} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of 200-kilobyte videos the drive can store is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",

Determine how many 200-kilobyte videos can be stored with the remaining storage space.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total storage space used by the 400 photos:\n\\[\n400 \\text{ photos} \\times 1.5 \\text{ kilobytes per photo} = 600 \\text{ kilobytes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find out how much storage space is left on the drive after storing the 400 photos. The drive has enough storage space to store 2000 photos, so the total storage space of the drive is:\n\\[\n2000 \\text{ photos} \\times 1.5 \\text{ kilobytes per photo} = 3000 \\text{ kilobytes}\n\\]\n\nSubtract the storage space used by the photos from the total storage space of the drive:\n\\[\n3000 \\text{ kilobytes} - 600 \\text{ kilobytes} = 2400 \\text{ kilobytes}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine how many 200-kilobyte videos can be stored with the remaining 2400 kilobytes:\n\\[\n2400 \\text{ kilobytes} \\div 200 \\text{ kilobytes per video} = 12 \\text{ videos}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of 200-kilobyte videos that the drive can store is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
        "To determine how many 200-kilobyte videos the portable computer drive can store after having 400 photos on it, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.
