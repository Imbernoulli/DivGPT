Divide half of the total savings by 4 to find out how much each child receives.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. **Total savings by the husband:**\n   - The husband saves $335 every week.\n   - There are 4 weeks in a month and 6 months in total.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total savings by the husband} = 335 \\times 4 \\times 6\n   \\]\n   First, calculate the savings per month:\n   \\[\n   335 \\times 4 = 1340\n   \\]\n   Then, calculate the savings for 6 months:\n   \\[\n   1340 \\times 6 = 8040\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total savings by the wife:**\n   - The wife saves $225 every week.\n   - There are 4 weeks in a month and 6 months in total.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total savings by the wife} = 225 \\times 4 \\times 6\n   \\]\n   First, calculate the savings per month:\n   \\[\n   225 \\times 4 = 900\n   \\]\n   Then, calculate the savings for 6 months:\n   \\[\n   900 \\times 6 = 5400\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total savings of the couple:**\n   - Add the total savings by the husband and the wife.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total savings} = 8040 + 5400 = 13440\n   \\]\n\n4. **Half of the total savings:**\n   - Divide the total savings by 2.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Half of the total savings} = \\frac{13440}{2} = 6720\n   \\]\n\n5. **Amount each child receives:**\n   - Divide half of the total savings by 4.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount each child receives} = \\frac{6720}{4} = 1680\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each child receives \\(\\boxed{1680}\\).",

Calculate the total amount saved by the wife in 6 months.\n3. Find the total savings of the couple by adding the amounts saved by the husband and the wife.\n4. Determine half of the total savings.\n5. Divide half of the total savings by 4 to find out how much each child receives.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. The husband saves $335 every week. There are 6 months and each month has 4 weeks, so the total number of weeks in 6 months is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 4 = 24 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total amount saved by the husband is:\n   \\[\n   335 \\times 24 = 8040 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. The wife saves $225 every week. Using the same calculation for the total number of weeks in 6 months, the total amount saved by the wife is:\n   \\[\n   225 \\times 24 = 5400 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. The total savings of the couple is the sum of the amounts saved by the husband and the wife:\n   \\[\n   8040 + 5400 = 13440 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. Half of the total savings is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{13440}{2} = 6720 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. Each child receives one-fourth of half of the total savings:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6720}{4} = 1680 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each child receives \\(\\boxed{1680}\\) dollars.",

Divide the half of the total savings by the number of children.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount saved by the husband in 6 months. The husband saves $335 every week, and there are 4 weeks in each month. Therefore, in one month, he saves:\n\\[ 335 \\times 4 = 1340 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nSince he saves for 6 months, the total amount saved by the husband is:\n\\[ 1340 \\times 6 = 8040 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount saved by the wife in 6 months. The wife saves $225 every week, and there are 4 weeks in each month. Therefore, in one month, she saves:\n\\[ 225 \\times 4 = 900 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nSince she saves for 6 months, the total amount saved by the wife is:\n\\[ 900 \\times 6 = 5400 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total savings by adding the amounts saved by the husband and the wife:\n\\[ 8040 + 5400 = 13440 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we determine half of the total savings:\n\\[ \\frac{13440}{2} = 6720 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we divide the half of the total savings by the number of children, which is 4:\n\\[ \\frac{6720}{4} = 1680 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, each child receives \\(\\boxed{1680}\\) dollars.",

Determine the total weekly contribution of the couple.\n3. Calculate the total savings over 6 months.\n4. Find half of the total savings.\n5. Divide half of the total savings by the number of children.\n\nLet's start with the weekly contributions:\n- The husband contributes $335 each week.\n- The wife contributes $225 each week.\n- Therefore, the total weekly contribution of the couple is $335 + $225 = $560.\n\nNext, we calculate the total savings over 6 months. Since there are 4 weeks in each month, the total number of weeks in 6 months is 6 * 4 = 24 weeks.\n- The total savings over 24 weeks is $560 * 24 = $13440.\n\nNow, we find half of the total savings:\n- Half of $13440 is $13440 / 2 = $6720.\n\nFinally, we divide half of the total savings by the number of children. Since there are 4 children, each child receives $6720 / 4 = $1680.\n\nTherefore, each child receives \\boxed{1680}.",
