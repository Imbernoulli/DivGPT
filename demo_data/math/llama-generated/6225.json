        "First, we need to determine the total value of Alice's quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25 and she has 20 quarters, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 0.25 = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to convert these 5 dollars into nickels. Since each nickel is worth $0.05, we calculate the number of nickels by dividing 5 dollars by $0.05:\n\n\\[\n5 \\div 0.05 = 100 \\text{ nickels}\n\\]\n\nOut of these 100 nickels, 20% are iron nickels worth $3 each. We calculate the number of iron nickels by finding 20% of 100:\n\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 100 = 20 \\text{ iron nickels}\n\\]\n\nThe remaining nickels are regular nickels. We calculate the number of regular nickels by subtracting the number of iron nickels from the total number of nickels:\n\n\\[\n100 - 20 = 80 \\text{ regular nickels}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total value of the iron nickels. Since each iron nickel is worth $3, we multiply the number of iron nickels by 3:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times 3 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total value of the regular nickels. Since each regular nickel is worth $0.05, we multiply the number of regular nickels by 0.05:\n\n\\[\n80 \\times 0.05 = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the total value of Alice's money by adding the value of the iron nickels and the value of the regular nickels:\n\n\\[\n60 + 4 = 64 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total value of her money now is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{64}\n\\]",

So, the number of regular nickels is:\n\n\\[\n100 - 20 = 80 \\text{ regular nickels}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the value of the iron nickels. Since each iron nickel is worth $3, the total value of the iron nickels is:\n\n\\[\n20 \\text{ iron nickels} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/iron nickel} = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the value of the regular nickels. Since each regular nickel is worth 5 cents, the total value of the regular nickels is:\n\n\\[\n80 \\text{ regular nickels} \\times 0.05 \\text{ dollars/nickel} = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the value of the iron nickels and the value of the regular nickels to find the total value of Alice's money now:\n\n\\[\n60 \\text{ dollars} + 4 \\text{ dollars} = 64 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total value of her money now is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{64}\n\\]",
