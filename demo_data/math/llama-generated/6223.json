Let \\( m \\) represent the number of male members and \\( f \\) represent the number of female members.\n\nAccording to the problem, there are two times as many female members as male members. This relationship can be expressed as:\n\\[\nf = 2m\n\\]\n\nWe are also given that the total number of members in the club is 18. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\nm + f = 18\n\\]\n\nNext, we substitute the expression for \\( f \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[\nm + 2m = 18\n\\]\n\nCombining the terms on the left side, we get:\n\\[\n3m = 18\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( m \\), we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[\nm = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n\\]\n\nNow that we know there are 6 male members, we can find the number of female members using the relationship \\( f = 2m \\):\n\\[\nf = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of female members in the glee club is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
