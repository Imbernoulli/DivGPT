        "To determine the total number of fish Jonah has now, we can break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of fish**: Jonah starts with 14 small fish.\n2. **Adding more fish**: Jonah adds 2 more fish, so the total number of fish now is:\n   \\[\n   14 + 2 = 16\n   \\]\n3. **Fish eaten by the new fish**: The 2 new fish eat 6 of the original fish.
