        "To determine how many songs Julia can download in half an hour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert half an hour into seconds:**\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ hour} = 60 \\text{ minutes} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 1 \\text{ minute} = 60 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, half an hour is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ hour} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ minutes} = 30 \\times 60 \\text{ seconds} = 1800 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total data Julia can download in 1800 seconds:**\n   Julia's internet speed is 20 MBps (megabytes per second).

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so in half an hour (which is 30 minutes), the total amount of data she can download is:\n\\[ 20 \\, \\text{MBps} \\times 60 \\, \\text{seconds/minute} \\times 30 \\, \\text{minutes} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the data downloaded in one minute:\n\\[ 20 \\, \\text{MBps} \\times 60 \\, \\text{seconds/minute} = 1200 \\, \\text{MB/minute} \\]\n\nNext, calculate the data downloaded in half an hour:\n\\[ 1200 \\, \\text{MB/minute} \\times 30 \\, \\text{minutes} = 36000 \\, \\text{MB} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many songs she can download with that amount of data.**\n\nEach song is 5 MB in size. So, the number of songs she can download is:\n\\[ \\frac{36000 \\, \\text{MB}}{5 \\, \\text{MB/song}} = 7200 \\, \\text{songs} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of songs Julia can download in half an hour is \\(\\boxed{7200}\\).",
        "To determine how many songs Julia can download in half an hour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of data Julia can download in half an hour.\n2. Determine how many songs correspond to that amount of data.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many seconds are in half an hour:\n\\[\n\\text{Half an hour} = 30 \\text{ minutes} = 30 \\times 60 \\text{ seconds} = 1800 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of data Julia can download in 1800 seconds. Since her internet speed is 20 MBps, we multiply the speed by the time:\n\\[\n\\text{Total data} = 20 \\text{ MBps} \\times 1800 \\text{ seconds} = 36000 \\text{ MB}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many songs correspond to 36000 MB. Since each song is 5 MB, we divide the total data by the size of each song:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of songs} = \\frac{36000 \\text{ MB}}{5 \\text{ MB/song}} = 7200 \\text{ songs}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of songs Julia can download in half an hour is \\boxed{7200}.",
