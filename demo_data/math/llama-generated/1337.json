        "To determine how much money Matt can save by buying 20 key chains at a lower price, we need to calculate the cost of 20 key chains in both ways and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of 20 key chains in packs of 10:\n- Each pack of 10 key chains costs $20.\n- To get 20 key chains, Matt needs to buy 2 packs.\n- Therefore, the total cost is \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of 20 key chains in packs of 4:\n- Each pack of 4 key chains costs $12.\n- To get 20 key chains, Matt needs to buy 5 packs (since \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\)).\n- Therefore, the total cost is \\(5 \\times 12 = 60\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the two costs:\n- The cost of 20 key chains in packs of 4 is $60.\n- The cost of 20 key chains in packs of 10 is $40.\n- The difference is \\(60 - 40 = 20\\) dollars.\n\nSo, Matt can save \\(\\boxed{20}\\) dollars by choosing to buy 20 key chains at a lower price.",
