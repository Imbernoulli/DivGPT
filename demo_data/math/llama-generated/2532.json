        "To determine what percent of the town is immune in some way, we need to consider the three groups of people: those who are vaccinated, those who have recovered from COVID, and those who are both vaccinated and have recovered from COVID.\n\nLet's denote the total number of townspeople by \\( T \\).\n\n1. The number of townspeople who have received the full COVID vaccine is \\( \\frac{1}{3}T \\).\n2. The number of townspeople who have recovered from COVID is \\( \\frac{1}{3}T \\).\n3. The number of townspeople who are both vaccinated and have recovered from COVID is \\( \\frac{1}{6}T \\).\n\nTo find the total number of townspeople who are immune in some way, we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. According to this principle, the total number of people who are immune is the sum of the number of vaccinated people and the number of people who have recovered from COVID, minus the number of people who are both vaccinated and have recovered from COVID.\n\nSo, the total number of immune townspeople is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}T + \\frac{1}{3}T - \\frac{1}{6}T\n\\]\n\nTo combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 6 is 6. Therefore, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 6:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}T = \\frac{2}{6}T\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}T = \\frac{2}{6}T\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6}T = \\frac{1}{6}T\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute these into the expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{6}T + \\frac{2}{6}T - \\frac{1}{6}T = \\frac{2 + 2 - 1}{6}T = \\frac{3}{6}T = \\frac{1}{2}T\n\\]\n\nThis means that half of the town is immune in some way. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}T \\times 100 = 50\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percent of the town that is immune in some way is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
        "To determine the percentage of the town that is immune in some way, we need to consider the following information:\n\n1. The fraction of townspeople who have received the full COVID vaccine is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n2. The fraction of townspeople who are immune because they already recovered from COVID is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n3. The fraction of townspeople who are both vaccinated and already had COVID is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nWe can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the total fraction of townspeople who are immune in some way. Let's denote:\n- \\(A\\) as the set of townspeople who have received the full COVID vaccine.\n- \\(B\\) as the set of townspeople who are immune because they already recovered from COVID.\n\nThe principle of inclusion and exclusion for two sets states:\n\\[ |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B| \\]\nwhere \\( |A \\cup B| \\) is the number of elements in the union of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\( |A| \\) is the number of elements in set \\(A\\), \\( |B| \\) is the number of elements in set \\(B\\), and \\( |A \\cap B| \\) is the number of elements in the intersection of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we get:\n\\[ |A \\cup B| = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 3 and 6 is 6. So, we rewrite the fractions:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{6} \\]\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the formula:\n\\[ |A \\cup B| = \\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the town that is immune in some way is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 = 50\\% \\]\n\nSo, the percentage of the town that is immune in some way is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
