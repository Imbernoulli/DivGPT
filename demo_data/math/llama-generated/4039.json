We know that he earned $150 more in the second month than in the first month. Since he earned $200 in the first month, we can find his second month's earnings as follows:\n\\[ 200 + 150 = 350 \\]\nSo, Sam earned $350 in the second month.\n\nNext, we find the total earnings for both months by adding the earnings from the first month and the second month:\n\\[ 200 + 350 = 550 \\]\nSo, Sam earned a total of $550 over the two months.\n\nNow, we need to determine the total number of hours Sam spent tutoring. Since he earns $10 per hour, we divide his total earnings by his hourly wage:\n\\[ 550 \\div 10 = 55 \\]\nSo, Sam spent a total of 55 hours on tutoring over the two months.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Sam spent on tutoring for two months is \\(\\boxed{55}\\).",

Since he earns $10 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he worked in the first month by dividing his earnings by his hourly wage:\n\\[\n\\frac{200}{10} = 20\n\\]\nSo, Sam worked 20 hours in the first month.\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the number of hours he worked in the second month by dividing his earnings by his hourly wage:\n\\[\n\\frac{350}{10} = 35\n\\]\nSo, Sam worked 35 hours in the second month.\n\nTo find the total number of hours Sam spent on tutoring over the two months, we add the number of hours he worked in the first month to the number of hours he worked in the second month:\n\\[\n20 + 35 = 55\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of hours Sam spent on tutoring for two months is \\boxed{55}.",
