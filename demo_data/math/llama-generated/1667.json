Let \\( F \\) represent the number of games Frankie won, and \\( C \\) represent the number of games Carla won.\n\nWe know from the problem statement that Frankie won half as many games as Carla. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:\n\\[\nF = \\frac{1}{2}C\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, we know that the total number of games played by both players is 30.

        "To determine how many games Carla won, we start by defining the variables for the number of games each player won. Let \\( C \\) represent the number of games Carla won. According to the problem, Frankie won half as many games as Carla, so Frankie won \\( \\frac{C}{2} \\) games.\n\nThe total number of games played between Frankie and Carla is 30. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of games:\n\n\\[\nC + \\frac{C}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nTo solve this equation, we first eliminate the fraction by finding a common denominator. The common denominator for \\( C \\) and \\( \\frac{C}{2} \\) is 2. We rewrite \\( C \\) as \\( \\frac{2C}{2} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2C}{2} + \\frac{C}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nNow, we combine the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2C + C}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3C}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( C \\), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[\n3C = 60\n\\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nC = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, Carla won \\(\\boxed{20}\\) games.\n\nTo verify, we calculate the number of games Frankie won:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\nAdding the games won by Carla and Frankie gives:\n\n\\[\n20 + 10 = 30\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that our solution is correct.

To verify, we calculate the number of games Frankie won:\n\\[\nF = \\frac{1}{2}C = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 = 10\n\\]\n\nAdding the games won by both players confirms the total:\n\\[\nF + C = 10 + 20 = 30\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of games Carla won is indeed \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

        "To determine how many games Carla won, we start by defining variables for the number of games each player won. Let \\( F \\) represent the number of games Frankie won, and \\( C \\) represent the number of games Carla won.\n\nWe know from the problem statement that:\n1. Frankie and Carla played a total of 30 games.\n2. Frankie won half as many games as Carla.\n\nWe can express these relationships with the following equations:\n\\[\nF + C = 30\n\\]\n\\[\nF = \\frac{1}{2}C\n\\]\n\nNext, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \\( C \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}C + C = 30\n\\]\n\nTo combine the terms on the left side, we factor out \\( C \\):\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + 1\\right)C = 30\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction inside the parentheses:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2}C = 30\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( C \\), multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), which is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\):\n\\[\nC = 30 \\times \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nPerform the multiplication:\n\\[\nC = 30 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 30 \\times 0.6667 = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, Carla won:\n\\[\nC = 20\n\\]\n\nK怎样辘ター salle расс/\"+.bias Managing_overlap.ci.gameObject обычноtel בעבר� utc

        "To determine how many games Carla won, we start by defining the number of games Frankie won as \\( F \\) and the number of games Carla won as \\( C \\). According to the problem, Frankie won half as many games as Carla, which can be written as:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{1}{2}C \\]\n\nWe also know that the total number of games played is 30, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ F + C = 30 \\]\n\nNext, we substitute the expression for \\( F \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}C + C = 30 \\]\n\nTo combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator.

To verify, we calculate the number of games Frankie won:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{1}{2}C = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 = 10 \\]\n\nAdding the number of games Frankie won and the number of games Carla won gives:\n\n\\[ F + C = 10 + 20 = 30 \\]\n\nThis confirms that our solution is correct.

        "To determine how many games Carla won, we start by defining variables for the number of games each player won. Let \\( C \\) represent the number of games Carla won, and \\( F \\) represent the number of games Frankie won.\n\nAccording to the problem, Frankie won half as many games as Carla.
