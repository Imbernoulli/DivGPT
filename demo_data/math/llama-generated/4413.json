Therefore, the number of cookies on one tray is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ rows} \\times 6 \\text{ cookies per row} = 30 \\text{ cookies} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cookies are on all four baking trays. Since each tray has 30 cookies and there are four trays, the total number of cookies is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ trays} \\times 30 \\text{ cookies per tray} = 120 \\text{ cookies} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cookies Lara is baking is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
