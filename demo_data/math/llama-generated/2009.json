        "To determine how many minutes it will take Amanda's car to make a round trip to the beach, we first need to find out how long it takes the car to make a one-way trip.\n\nThe bus takes 40 minutes to drive 80 miles to the beach. According to the problem, Amanda's car takes five fewer minutes than the bus to complete the same trip. Therefore, the time it takes Amanda's car to drive one-way is:\n\\[ 40 - 5 = 35 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nA round trip is twice the distance of a one-way trip, so it will take Amanda's car twice the time of a one-way trip to complete the round trip. Thus, the time it takes Amanda's car to make a round trip is:\n\\[ 35 \\times 2 = 70 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, the number of minutes it will take Amanda's car to make a round trip is:\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]",
