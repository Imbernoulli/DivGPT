        "To determine Sam's current age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Drew's age in five years:**\n   Drew is currently 12 years old.

Let \\( S \\) represent Sam's current age. In five years, Sam's age will be \\( S + 5 \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   S + 5 = 3 \\times 17\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the right-hand side of the equation:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 17 = 51\n   \\]\n   So the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   S + 5 = 51\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( S \\):**\n   To find Sam's current age, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   S = 51 - 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S = 46\n   \\]\n\nThus, Sam's current age is \\(\\boxed{46}\\).",
