        "Let's start by calculating the price of RAM after the initial 30% increase due to the fire. The original price of RAM is $50. Therefore, the price after the increase can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ 50 + 0.30 \\times 50 = 50 \\times (1 + 0.30) = 50 \\times 1.30 = 65 \\]\n\nSo, the price of RAM after the fire is $65.\n\nNext, we need to find out the price after it falls by 20% from the increased price. The price after the decrease can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ 65 - 0.20 \\times 65 = 65 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 65 \\times 0.80 = 52 \\]\n\nSo, the current price of RAM is \\(\\boxed{52}\\)."
