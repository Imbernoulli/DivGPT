        "To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pages Bill read from the 1st to the 12th of April.\n2. Use the information that this total represents two-thirds of the book to find the total number of pages in the book.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pages Bill read. Bill started reading on the 1st of April and read 8 pages every day. By the 12th of April, he had read for 12 days. Therefore, the total number of pages read is:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ pages/day} \\times 12 \\text{ days} = 96 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nNext, we know that these 96 pages represent two-thirds of the book. Let \\( P \\) be the total number of pages in the book. According to the problem, two-thirds of \\( P \\) is equal to 96 pages. We can write this relationship as:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} P = 96 \\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), we need to solve for \\( P \\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), which is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\):\n\\[ P = 96 \\times \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\\[ P = 96 \\times 1.5 \\]\n\\[ P = 144 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages in the book is \\(\\boxed{144}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of pages in the book, we start by calculating the number of days Bill has been reading by the 12th of April. Since he started on the first day of April, he has been reading for 12 days.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of pages Bill has read by the 12th of April. Since he reads 8 pages each day, we multiply the number of days by the number of pages read per day:\n\\[ 12 \\times 8 = 96 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, by the 12th of April, Bill had covered two-thirds of the book. Therefore, the 96 pages he has read represent two-thirds of the total number of pages in the book. Let's denote the total number of pages in the book by \\( x \\). We can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3}x = 96 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation by isolating \\( x \\).

Use the information that this total represents two-thirds of the book to find the total number of pages.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of days Bill has been reading by the 12th of April. Since he started reading on the first day of April, he has been reading for 12 days.\n\nNext, we determine the total number of pages Bill has read by the 12th of April. Since he reads 8 pages every day, we multiply the number of days by the number of pages per day:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ days} \\times 8 \\text{ pages/day} = 96 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nWe know that the 96 pages he has read represent two-thirds of the book. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of pages in the book. Then, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3}x = 96 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), which is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\):\n\\[ x = 96 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 96 \\times 1.5 = 144 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages in the book is \\(\\boxed{144}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of days Bill read:**\n   Bill started reading on the first day of April and continued until the 12th of April. Therefore, the number of days he read is:\n   \\[\n   12 - 1 + 1 = 12 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of pages Bill read in these 12 days:**\n   Bill reads 8 pages each day. Thus, the total number of pages he read in 12 days is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ pages/day} \\times 12 \\text{ days} = 96 \\text{ pages}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Relate the pages read to the total number of pages in the book:**\n   According to the problem, by the 12th of April, Bill had covered two-thirds of the book. Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of pages in the book. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3}T = 96\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( T \\):**\n   To find \\( T \\), we need to isolate \\( T \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), which is \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\):\n   \\[\n   T = 96 \\times \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   \\[\n   T = 96 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 96 \\times 1.5 = 144\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pages in the book is \\(\\boxed{144}\\).",
