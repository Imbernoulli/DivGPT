        "To determine the total number of birds Jen has, we need to find out how many chickens she has first. We know from the problem statement that Jen has 10 more ducks than four times the number of chickens. Let's denote the number of chickens by \\( c \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of ducks Jen has is given by the equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ducks} = 4c + 10\n\\]\nWe are also given that Jen has 150 ducks. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n4c + 10 = 150\n\\]\nTo find the value of \\( c \\), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n4c = 140\n\\]\nNext, we divide both sides by 4:\n\\[\nc = 35\n\\]\nSo, Jen has 35 chickens. Now, we need to find the total number of birds Jen has, which is the sum of the number of ducks and the number of chickens:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of birds} = \\text{Number of ducks} + \\text{Number of chickens} = 150 + 35 = 185\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of birds Jen has is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{185}\n\\]",

Therefore, we can substitute 150 for the number of ducks in the equation:\n\n\\[\n150 = 4c + 10\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to solve for \\( c \\).

We know from the problem statement that Jen has 150 ducks. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   4c + 10 = 150\n   \\]\n4. To find the number of chickens, we need to solve for \\( c \\). First, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   4c = 150 - 10\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right-hand side gives:\n   \\[\n   4c = 140\n   \\]\n5. Next, divide both sides by 4 to isolate \\( c \\):\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{140}{4}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the division gives:\n   \\[\n   c = 35\n   \\]\n6. Jen has 35 chickens.\n7. To find the total number of birds, we add the number of ducks and the number of chickens:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of birds} = \\text{Number of ducks} + \\text{Number of chickens}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of birds} = 150 + 35\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the addition gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of birds} = 185\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of birds Jen has is \\(\\boxed{185}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of birds Jen has, we need to find out how many chickens she has first. We know from the problem statement that Jen has 150 ducks, which is 10 more than four times the number of chickens. Let's define the number of chickens as \\( c \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of ducks can be expressed as:\n\\[ 150 = 4c + 10 \\]\n\nTo find the number of chickens, we need to solve this equation for \\( c \\). First, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 150 - 10 = 4c \\]\n\\[ 140 = 4c \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 4:\n\\[ c = \\frac{140}{4} \\]\n\\[ c = 35 \\]\n\nSo, Jen has 35 chickens. To find the total number of birds, we add the number of ducks and the number of chickens:\n\\[ \\text{Total birds} = \\text{Number of ducks} + \\text{Number of chickens} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total birds} = 150 + 35 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total birds} = 185 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of birds Jen has is \\(\\boxed{185}\\).",
