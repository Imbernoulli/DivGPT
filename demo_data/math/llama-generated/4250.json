Therefore, Johanna has:\n\n\\[ 21 - 5 = 16 \\text{ turtles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many turtles Owen has after 1 month. According to the problem, Owen has twice as many turtles as he originally did. So, Owen now has:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 21 = 42 \\text{ turtles} \\]\n\nNow, let's determine how many turtles Johanna has after 1 month. Johanna loses half of her turtles and donates the rest to Owen. Since she initially has 16 turtles, she loses:\n\n\\[ \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\text{ turtles} \\]\n\nThis means Johanna donates the remaining 8 turtles to Owen. Therefore, after 1 month, Owen's total number of turtles is the sum of his original number of turtles after doubling and the turtles he received from Johanna:\n\n\\[ 42 + 8 = 50 \\text{ turtles} \\]\n\nThus, the number of turtles Owen has is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",
