        "To determine how many mugs Hannah has of another color than mentioned, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of red mugs:**\n   Hannah has 12 yellow mugs. Since she has only half as many red mugs as yellow mugs, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red mugs} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of blue mugs:**\n   Hannah has three times more blue mugs than red mugs. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of blue mugs} = 3 \\times 6 = 18\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of mugs in the mentioned colors:**\n   We add the number of red, blue, and yellow mugs:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of mentioned mugs} = 6 + 18 + 12 = 36\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of mugs of another color:**\n   Hannah has a total of 40 mugs. To find the number of mugs of another color, we subtract the total number of mentioned mugs from the total number of mugs:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of mugs of another color} = 40 - 36 = 4\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of mugs of another color than mentioned is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
        "To determine the number of mugs Hannah has in each color, we start by defining variables for the number of red mugs. Let \\( r \\) represent the number of red mugs.

        "Let's define the number of red mugs Hannah has as \\( r \\). According to the problem, Hannah has half as many red mugs as yellow mugs. Since she has 12 yellow mugs, we can express the number of red mugs as:\n\\[ r = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\]\n\nNext, the problem states that Hannah has three times more blue mugs than red mugs. Therefore, the number of blue mugs is:\n\\[ 3r = 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\]\n\nWe know the total number of mugs Hannah has is 40. Let's denote the number of mugs of the other color as \\( x \\). The total number of mugs can be expressed as the sum of the mugs of all four colors:\n\\[ r + 12 + 18 + x = 40 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( r \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 6 + 12 + 18 + x = 40 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we have:\n\\[ 36 + x = 40 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 40 - 36 = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of mugs of another color than mentioned is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]",

Therefore, the number of yellow mugs is:\n\\[\n2r = 12\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( r \\):\n\\[\nr = \\frac{12}{1} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Hannah has three times more blue mugs than red mugs.
