Since Jina has 15 bunnies, the number of additional teddies is \\(2 \\times 15 = 30\\).\n\nNow, let's find the total number of teddies Jina has after receiving the additional teddies. Initially, she has 5 teddies, and she receives 30 more, so the total number of teddies is \\(5 + 30 = 35\\).\n\nFinally, we add up the total number of mascots Jina has:\n- Teddies: 35\n- Bunnies: 15\n- Koala bear: 1\n\nThe total number of mascots is \\(35 + 15 + 1 = 51\\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of mascots Jina has is \\(\\boxed{51}\\).",
