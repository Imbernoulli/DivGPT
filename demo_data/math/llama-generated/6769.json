        "To determine the total number of toothbrushes given away in a 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of patients the dental office sees in one day.\n2. Determine the total number of patients seen in a 5-day work week.\n3. Calculate the total number of toothbrushes given away in a 5-day work week.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many patients the dental office sees in one day. The dental office works for 8 hours each day and each visit takes 0.5 hours. Therefore, the number of patients seen in one day is:\n\\[\n\\frac{8 \\text{ hours}}{0.5 \\text{ hours/visit}} = 16 \\text{ patients/day}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many patients the dental office sees in a 5-day work week. Since the dental office sees 16 patients each day, the total number of patients seen in a 5-day work week is:\n\\[\n16 \\text{ patients/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 80 \\text{ patients}\n\\]\n\nSince the dental office gives away 2 toothbrushes to each patient, the total number of toothbrushes given away in a 5-day work week is:\n\\[\n80 \\text{ patients} \\times 2 \\text{ toothbrushes/patient} = 160 \\text{ toothbrushes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of toothbrushes given away in a 5-day work week is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{160}\n\\]",
