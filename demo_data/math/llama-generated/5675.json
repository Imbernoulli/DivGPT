        "To determine how many cookies Uncle Jude put in the fridge, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cookies given to Anna.\n2. Calculate the total number of cookies given away.\n3. Subtract the total number of cookies given away from the total number of cookies baked to find out how many cookies were put in the fridge.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of cookies given to Anna. Uncle Jude gave twice as many cookies to Anna as he gave to Tim. Since he gave 15 cookies to Tim, we have:\n\\[ 2 \\times 15 = 30 \\]\nSo, Uncle Jude gave 30 cookies to Anna.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of cookies given away. Uncle Jude gave cookies to Tim, Mike, and Anna. The total number of cookies given away is:\n\\[ 15 + 23 + 30 = 68 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of cookies given away from the total number of cookies baked to find out how many cookies were put in the fridge:\n\\[ 256 - 68 = 188 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies Uncle Jude put in the fridge is:\n\\[ \\boxed{188} \\]",

Since he gave 15 cookies to Tim, we can calculate the number of cookies given to Anna as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 15 = 30 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cookies Uncle Jude gave away in total. This is the sum of the cookies given to Tim, Mike, and Anna:\n\\[ 15 + 23 + 30 = 68 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of cookies given away from the total number of cookies baked to find out how many cookies Uncle Jude put in the fridge:\n\\[ 256 - 68 = 188 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies Uncle Jude put in the fridge is \\(\\boxed{188}\\).",
