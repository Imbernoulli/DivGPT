        "To determine how many bones Juniper has remaining, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of bones Juniper has.\n   Juniper initially has 4 bones.\n\n2. Her master gives her enough bones to double her number of bones.\n   Doubling 4 bones gives us:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 2 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, after receiving more bones from her master, Juniper has 8 bones.\n\n3. The neighbor's dog steals away two of Juniper's bones.\n   Subtracting 2 bones from 8 bones gives us:\n   \\[\n   8 - 2 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, after the neighbor's dog steals some bones, Juniper has 6 bones.\n\nTherefore, the number of bones Juniper has remaining is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
