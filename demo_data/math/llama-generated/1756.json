        "To determine the total number of products produced by the factory in 5 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of coolers produced per hour.\n2. Determine the total number of refrigerators produced in one day.\n3. Determine the total number of coolers produced in one day.\n4. Calculate the total number of products produced in one day.\n5. Calculate the total number of products produced in 5 days.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of coolers produced per hour. The factory produces 70 more coolers than refrigerators per hour. Since the factory produces 90 refrigerators per hour, the number of coolers produced per hour is:\n\\[ 90 + 70 = 160 \\]\n\nNext, let's determine the total number of refrigerators produced in one day. The factory works 9 hours a day, so the number of refrigerators produced in one day is:\n\\[ 90 \\times 9 = 810 \\]\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of coolers produced in one day. Similarly, the factory works 9 hours a day, so the number of coolers produced in one day is:\n\\[ 160 \\times 9 = 1440 \\]\n\nThe total number of products produced in one day is the sum of the refrigerators and coolers produced in one day:\n\\[ 810 + 1440 = 2250 \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of products produced in 5 days. Since the factory produces 2250 products per day, the total number of products produced in 5 days is:\n\\[ 2250 \\times 5 = 11250 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of products produced by the factory in 5 days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11250} \\]",

The factory works 9 hours a day, so:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ refrigerators per hour} \\times 9 \\text{ hours per day} = 810 \\text{ refrigerators per day} \\]\n\nThen, we determine the total number of coolers produced in one day. Since the factory produces 160 coolers per hour, we have:\n\\[ 160 \\text{ coolers per hour} \\times 9 \\text{ hours per day} = 1440 \\text{ coolers per day} \\]\n\nNow, we find the total number of products produced in one day by adding the number of refrigerators and coolers produced in one day:\n\\[ 810 \\text{ refrigerators per day} + 1440 \\text{ coolers per day} = 2250 \\text{ products per day} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of products produced over 5 days:\n\\[ 2250 \\text{ products per day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 11250 \\text{ products} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of products produced by the factory over 5 days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11250} \\]",

        "To determine the total number of products produced by the factory in 5 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coolers produced per hour:**\n   The factory produces 70 more coolers than refrigerators per hour. Given that it produces 90 refrigerators per hour, we can calculate the number of coolers as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Coolers per hour} = \\text{Refrigerators per hour} + 70 = 90 + 70 = 160\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of refrigerators produced in one day:**\n   The factory works 9 hours a day. Therefore, the total number of refrigerators produced in one day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Refrigerators per day} = \\text{Refrigerators per hour} \\times \\text{Hours per day} = 90 \\times 9 = 810\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of coolers produced in one day:**\n   Similarly, the total number of coolers produced in one day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Coolers per day} = \\text{Coolers per hour} \\times \\text{Hours per day} = 160 \\times 9 = 1440\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of products produced in one day:**\n   The total number of products produced in one day is the sum of the refrigerators and coolers produced in that day:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total products per day} = \\text{Refrigerators per day} + \\text{Coolers per day} = 810 + 1440 = 2250\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of products produced in 5 days:**\n   Finally, to find the total number of products produced in 5 days, we multiply the total number of products produced in one day by 5:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total products in 5 days} = \\text{Total products per day} \\times 5 = 2250 \\times 5 = 11250\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of products produced by the factory in 5 days is \\(\\boxed{11250}\\).",
