        "To determine how much tape Joy will have left over after wrapping it around the field once, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the perimeter of the field.\n2. Subtract the perimeter from the total length of the tape.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the perimeter of the field. The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\]\n\nThe length of the field is 60 feet and the width is 20 feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (60 + 20) = 2 \\times 80 = 160 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nSo, the perimeter of the field is 160 feet. This means Joy will use 160 feet of tape to wrap around the field once.\n\nNext, we subtract the perimeter from the total length of the tape to find out how much tape Joy will have left over:\n\\[ \\text{Remaining tape} = 250 - 160 = 90 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of tape Joy will have left over after wrapping it around the field once is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).",
