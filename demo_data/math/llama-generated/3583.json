Find the difference between the two average speeds.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Jennie's average speed when there is heavy traffic.**\n\nThe formula for average speed is:\n\\[ \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nWhen there is heavy traffic, Jennie drives 200 miles in 5 hours. So, her average speed is:\n\\[ \\text{Average speed}_{\\text{heavy traffic}} = \\frac{200 \\text{ miles}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 40 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Jennie's average speed when there is no traffic.**\n\nWhen there is no traffic, Jennie drives 200 miles in 4 hours. So, her average speed is:\n\\[ \\text{Average speed}_{\\text{no traffic}} = \\frac{200 \\text{ miles}}{4 \\text{ hours}} = 50 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between the two average speeds.**\n\nThe difference between her average speed when there is no traffic and when there is heavy traffic is:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Average speed}_{\\text{no traffic}} - \\text{Average speed}_{\\text{heavy traffic}} = 50 \\text{ miles per hour} - 40 \\text{ miles per hour} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, the difference between her average speed when there is heavy traffic and when there is no traffic is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
