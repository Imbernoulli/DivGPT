        "To determine how many tins James collects each day for the rest of the week, we need to first calculate the total number of tins he collects over the first three days.

Since James collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week (which is 4 days), we divide the remaining tins by 4:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tins collected each day for the rest of the week} = \\frac{200}{4} = 50\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of tins he collected each day for the rest of the week is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
        "To determine the number of tins James collected each day for the rest of the week, we first need to calculate the total number of tins he collected over the first three days. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **First day**: James collects 50 tins.\n2. **Second day**: James collects 3 times the number of tins he collected on the first day. Therefore, he collects \\(3 \\times 50 = 150\\) tins.\n3. **Third day**: James collects 50 tins fewer than the number he collected on the second day.
