        "First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies Frank bakes over the 6 days. Since Frank bakes two trays of cookies each day and each tray makes 12 cookies, the number of cookies baked each day is:\n\\[2 \\text{ trays/day} \\times 12 \\text{ cookies/tray} = 24 \\text{ cookies/day}\\]\nOver 6 days, the total number of cookies baked is:\n\\[24 \\text{ cookies/day} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 144 \\text{ cookies}\\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the cookies Frank eats each day to make sure they taste good. Frank eats one cookie each day for 6 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is:\n\\[1 \\text{ cookie/day} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 6 \\text{ cookies}\\]\n\nOn the sixth day, Ted comes over and eats 4 cookies. So, the total number of cookies eaten by Frank and Ted is:\n\\[6 \\text{ cookies} + 4 \\text{ cookies} = 10 \\text{ cookies}\\]\n\nTo find out how many cookies are left when Ted leaves, we subtract the total number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies baked:\n\\[144 \\text{ cookies} - 10 \\text{ cookies} = 134 \\text{ cookies}\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies left when Ted leaves is:\n\\[\\boxed{134}\\]",

Frank bakes 2 trays of cookies per day, and each tray makes 12 cookies. So, the number of cookies baked per day is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ trays/day} \\times 12 \\text{ cookies/tray} = 24 \\text{ cookies/day} \\]\n\nOver 6 days, the total number of cookies baked is:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ cookies/day} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 144 \\text{ cookies} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of cookies Frank eats. Frank eats 1 cookie each day for 6 days. So, the total number of cookies Frank eats is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ cookie/day} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 6 \\text{ cookies} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of cookies Ted eats. Ted eats 4 cookies on the sixth day. So, the total number of cookies Ted eats is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ cookies} \\]\n\nTo find out how many cookies are left when Ted leaves, we subtract the total number of cookies Frank eats and the total number of cookies Ted eats from the total number of cookies baked:\n\\[ 144 \\text{ cookies} - 6 \\text{ cookies} - 4 \\text{ cookies} = 134 \\text{ cookies} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies left when Ted leaves is:\n\\[ \\boxed{134} \\]",
