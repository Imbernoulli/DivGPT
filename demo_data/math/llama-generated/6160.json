The puppy needs to eat 2 ounces of this special dog food per day during the first 60 days of its life.  After that, it needs to eat 4 ounces per day of the special food until it is old enough to eat regular dog food.  If the special dog food is only sold in 5-pound bags, and there are 16 ounces in a pound, how many bags will the family need to buy to feed the puppy until it is old enough to eat regular dog food?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many bags of special dog food the family will need to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of food the puppy will consume over its first year of life. We'll break this down into two parts: the first 60 days and the remaining days.\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of food needed for the first 60 days:**\n   - The puppy eats 2 ounces per day.\n   - For 60 days, the total amount of food is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ ounces/day} \\times 60 \\text{ days} = 120 \\text{ ounces}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the amount of food needed for the remaining days:**\n   - The puppy is 1 year old, which is 365 days.\n   - After the first 60 days, there are:\n     \\[\n     365 \\text{ days} - 60 \\text{ days} = 305 \\text{ days}\n     \\]\n   - The puppy eats 4 ounces per day for these 305 days.\n   - The total amount of food for these days is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ ounces/day} \\times 305 \\text{ days} = 1220 \\text{ ounces}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of food needed for the entire year:**\n   - Add the amounts from the two parts:\n     \\[\n     120 \\text{ ounces} + 1220 \\text{ ounces} = 1340 \\text{ ounces}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert the total amount of food from ounces to pounds:**\n   - There are 16 ounces in a pound.\n   - The total weight in pounds is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1340 \\text{ ounces}}{16 \\text{ ounces/pound}} = 83.75 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine the number of bags needed:**\n   - Each bag weighs 5 pounds.\n   - The number of bags required is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{83.75 \\text{ pounds}}{5 \\text{ pounds/bag}} = 16.75 \\text{ bags}\n     \\]\n   - Since you cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, you need to round up to the next whole number.\n     \\[\n     16.75 \\text{ bags} \\approx 17 \\text{ bags}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the family will need to buy \\(\\boxed{17}\\) bags of special dog food.",
