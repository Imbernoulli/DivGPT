        "To determine the total number of apples Diane and Cecile bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many apples Cecile bought.\n2. Calculate how many apples Diane bought.\n3. Add the number of apples Cecile bought to the number of apples Diane bought.\n\nFirst, we know that Cecile bought 15 apples. According to the problem, Diane bought twenty more apples than Cecile. Therefore, we can calculate the number of apples Diane bought as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of apples Diane bought} = \\text{Number of apples Cecile bought} + 20 = 15 + 20 = 35 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of apples Cecile bought to the number of apples Diane bought to find the total number of apples they bought together:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of apples} = \\text{Number of apples Cecile bought} + \\text{Number of apples Diane bought} = 15 + 35 = 50 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of apples Diane and Cecile bought altogether is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
