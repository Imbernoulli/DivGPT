        "To determine the total amount James paid for everything, we need to calculate the cost of the dirt bikes, the cost of the off-road vehicles, and the registration fees separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the dirt bikes:\nJames buys 3 dirt bikes, and each dirt bike costs $150.\n\\[ 3 \\times 150 = 450 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the dirt bikes is $450.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the off-road vehicles:\nJames buys 4 off-road vehicles, and each off-road vehicle costs $300.\n\\[ 4 \\times 300 = 1200 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the off-road vehicles is $1200.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total registration fees:\nJames needs to register each of the 7 vehicles (3 dirt bikes and 4 off-road vehicles), and the registration fee for each vehicle is $25.\n\\[ 7 \\times 25 = 175 \\]\nSo, the total registration fees are $175.\n\nFinally, we sum the costs of the dirt bikes, the off-road vehicles, and the registration fees:\n\\[ 450 + 1200 + 175 = 1825 \\]\nSo, the total amount James paid for everything is \\(\\boxed{1825}\\).",
