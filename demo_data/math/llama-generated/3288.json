        "To determine how many slices of pie are left after Nancy gives some to Joe and Darcy, and Carl, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of slices Nancy gave to Joe and Darcy:**\n   Nancy gave \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the pie to Joe and Darcy. Since the pie is sliced into 8 pieces, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = 4 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of slices Nancy gave to Carl:**\n   Nancy gave \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the pie to Carl. Since the pie is sliced into 8 pieces, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 8 = 2 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of slices given away:**\n   Add the slices given to Joe and Darcy and the slices given to Carl:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ slices} + 2 \\text{ slices} = 6 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of slices left:**\n   Subtract the total number of slices given away from the total number of slices originally in the pie:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ slices} - 6 \\text{ slices} = 2 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of slices left is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
        "To determine how many slices of pie were left after Nancy gave some away, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of slices Nancy gave away:**\n   - Nancy gave \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the pie to Joe and Darcy.\n   - Nancy gave \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the pie to Carl.\n\n2. **Convert these fractions to slices:**\n   - The pie is divided into 8 pieces.\n   - \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the pie is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = 4 \\) slices.\n   - \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the pie is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 8 = 2 \\) slices.\n\n3. **Add the slices given away:**\n   - Total slices given away = 4 slices (to Joe and Darcy) + 2 slices (to Carl) = 6 slices.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of slices left:**\n   - Total slices initially = 8 slices.\n   - Slices given away = 6 slices.\n   - Slices left = 8 slices - 6 slices = 2 slices.\n\nTherefore, the number of slices left is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

        "To determine how many slices of pie were left after Nancy gave some to Joe, Darcy, and Carl, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of slices Nancy gave to Joe and Darcy.\n2. Calculate the number of slices Nancy gave to Carl.\n3. Subtract the total number of slices given away from the original number of slices.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of slices Nancy gave to Joe and Darcy. Nancy gave them \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the pie. Since the pie was sliced into 8 pieces, we can find out how many slices this is by multiplying:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = 4\n\\]\nSo, Nancy gave 4 slices to Joe and Darcy.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of slices Nancy gave to Carl. Nancy gave him \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the pie. Again, since the pie was sliced into 8 pieces, we can find out how many slices this is by multiplying:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 8 = 2\n\\]\nSo, Nancy gave 2 slices to Carl.\n\nNow, let's find out the total number of slices Nancy gave away. We add the slices given to Joe and Darcy and the slices given to Carl:\n\\[\n4 + 2 = 6\n\\]\nSo, Nancy gave away 6 slices in total.\n\nFinally, let's determine how many slices were left. We subtract the total number of slices given away from the original number of slices:\n\\[\n8 - 6 = 2\n\\]\nSo, the number of slices left is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
