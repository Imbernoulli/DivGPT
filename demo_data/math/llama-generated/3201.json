Since the ratio of green paint to the total mixture is 2 parts out of 8 parts (1+2+5=8), we can set up a proportion to find out how many gallons of paint correspond to each part of the ratio.\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of one part of the ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Value of one part} = \\frac{6 \\text{ gallons}}{2} = 3 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the amount of blue paint and white paint by multiplying the value of one part by the respective parts in the ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Blue paint} = 1 \\times 3 \\text{ gallons} = 3 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{White paint} = 5 \\times 3 \\text{ gallons} = 15 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nNext, we sum up the amounts of blue, green, and white paint to find the total amount of paint used:\n\\[\n\\text{Total paint} = \\text{Blue paint} + \\text{Green paint} + \\text{White paint} = 3 \\text{ gallons} + 6 \\text{ gallons} + 15 \\text{ gallons} = 24 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of paint Andy uses is \\boxed{24}.",
        "To determine the total amount of paint Andy uses, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the ratio**: Andy mixes blue, green, and white paint in a 1:2:5 ratio. This means for every 1 part of blue paint, there are 2 parts of green paint and 5 parts of white paint.\n\n2. **Identify the known quantity**: Andy uses 6 gallons of green paint. According to the ratio, the green paint corresponds to 2 parts.\n\n3. **Find the value of one part**: Since 2 parts of green paint equal 6 gallons, we can find the value of one part by dividing the amount of green paint by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value of one part} = \\frac{6 \\text{ gallons}}{2} = 3 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the amount of blue paint**: Blue paint corresponds to 1 part. Therefore, the amount of blue paint is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount of blue paint} = 1 \\times 3 \\text{ gallons} = 3 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the amount of white paint**: White paint corresponds to 5 parts.
