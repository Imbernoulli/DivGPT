        "To determine how many minutes Jessica will have left when she finishes the exam, we need to calculate her current pace and then use it to find out how long it will take her to complete the remaining questions.\n\nFirst, let's find out Jessica's pace. She has answered 16 questions in 12 minutes. Therefore, her pace is:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 \\text{ questions}}{12 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ questions}}{3 \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]\nThis means Jessica answers 4 questions every 3 minutes.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many questions she has left to answer. She has answered 16 questions out of 80, so the number of questions remaining is:\n\\[\n80 - 16 = 64 \\text{ questions}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate how long it will take her to answer the remaining 64 questions at her pace of 4 questions per 3 minutes. We can set up a proportion to find out the time required:\n\\[\n\\frac{4 \\text{ questions}}{3 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{64 \\text{ questions}}{x \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[\n4x = 64 \\times 3\n\\]\n\\[\n4x = 192\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{192}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 48 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nSo, it will take Jessica 48 minutes to answer the remaining 64 questions.\n\nSince Jessica has already used 12 minutes, the total time she will have spent on the exam when she finishes will be:\n\\[\n12 + 48 = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nSince she has one hour (which is 60 minutes) to take the exam, the number of minutes left when she finishes the exam will be:\n\\[\n60 - 60 = 0 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of minutes left when she finishes the exam is \\boxed{0}.",

Subtract the total time it will take her from the total time she has available.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Jessica's current pace in questions per minute.**\n\nJessica has answered 16 questions in 12 minutes. Therefore, her pace is:\n\\[\n\\text{Pace} = \\frac{16 \\text{ questions}}{12 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ questions per minute}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Use her pace to find out how long it will take her to complete all 80 questions.**\n\nTo find the total time needed to answer all 80 questions, we divide the total number of questions by her pace:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time needed} = \\frac{80 \\text{ questions}}{\\frac{4}{3} \\text{ questions per minute}} = 80 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the total time it will take her from the total time she has available.**\n\nJessica has 1 hour, which is 60 minutes, to take the exam. Since it will take her 60 minutes to complete the exam, the time left will be:\n\\[\n\\text{Time left} = 60 \\text{ minutes} - 60 \\text{ minutes} = 0 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of minutes left when she finishes the exam is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",

Subtract the time spent from the total time she has to find out how many minutes will be left.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Jessica's current rate of answering questions.**\n\nJessica has answered 16 questions in 12 minutes. Therefore, her rate of answering questions is:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 \\text{ questions}}{12 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ questions}}{3 \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many more minutes she will spend answering the remaining questions.**\n\nJessica has 80 questions in total and has already answered 16. So, the number of questions left is:\n\\[\n80 - 16 = 64 \\text{ questions}\n\\]\n\nSince she answers questions at a rate of \\(\\frac{4 \\text{ questions}}{3 \\text{ minutes}}\\), the time required to answer the remaining 64 questions is:\n\\[\n64 \\text{ questions} \\times \\frac{3 \\text{ minutes}}{4 \\text{ questions}} = 64 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 48 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the time spent from the total time she has to find out how many minutes will be left.**\n\nJessica has 60 minutes in total (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). She has already spent 12 minutes, and she will spend an additional 48 minutes to finish the exam. Therefore, the total time spent is:\n\\[\n12 + 48 = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nSince she will spend all 60 minutes, the number of minutes left will be:\n\\[\n60 - 60 = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of minutes left when she finishes the exam is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
