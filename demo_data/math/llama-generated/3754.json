Since he runs 5 miles and each mile takes him 10 minutes, the time for this segment is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ miles} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes per mile} = 50 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Rudy spends running the 4 miles at a rate of 9.5 minutes per mile. Since he runs 4 miles and each mile takes him 9.5 minutes, the time for this segment is:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ miles} \\times 9.5 \\text{ minutes per mile} = 4 \\times 9.5 = 38 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the times from both segments to find the total time Rudy runs:\n\\[\n50 \\text{ minutes} + 38 \\text{ minutes} = 88 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total length of time that Rudy runs is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total length of time that Rudy runs, we need to calculate the time he spends running each segment of his run and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Rudy spends running the initial 5 miles:\n- Rudy runs 5 miles at a rate of 10 minutes per mile.\n- Time for the first segment = \\( 5 \\text{ miles} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes per mile} = 50 \\text{ minutes} \\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Rudy spends running the subsequent 4 miles:\n- Rudy runs 4 miles at a rate of 9.5 minutes per mile.\n- Time for the second segment = \\( 4 \\text{ miles} \\times 9.5 \\text{ minutes per mile} = 4 \\times 9.5 = 38 \\text{ minutes} \\).\n\nNow, we sum the times for both segments to find the total time Rudy runs:\n- Total time = Time for the first segment + Time for the second segment\n- Total time = 50 minutes + 38 minutes = 88 minutes\n\nTherefore, the total length of time that Rudy runs is \\(\\boxed{88}\\) minutes.",
