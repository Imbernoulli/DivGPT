        "To determine the total time Carson will spend gardening, we need to break down the problem into two parts: mowing the lawn and planting the flowers.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Carson to mow the lawn. Carson has to mow 40 lines, and it takes him 2 minutes to mow each line. Therefore, the total time spent mowing the lawn is:\n\\[\n40 \\text{ lines} \\times 2 \\text{ minutes/line} = 80 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Carson to plant the flowers. Carson needs to plant 8 rows of flowers, and each row has 7 flowers. So, the total number of flowers he needs to plant is:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ rows} \\times 7 \\text{ flowers/row} = 56 \\text{ flowers}\n\\]\nIt takes him half a minute to plant each flower. Therefore, the total time spent planting the flowers is:\n\\[\n56 \\text{ flowers} \\times 0.5 \\text{ minutes/flower} = 28 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the time spent mowing the lawn and the time spent planting the flowers to get the total time Carson will spend gardening:\n\\[\n80 \\text{ minutes} + 28 \\text{ minutes} = 108 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time Carson will spend gardening is \\boxed{108}.",
