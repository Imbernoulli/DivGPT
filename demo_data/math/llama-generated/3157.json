        "To determine how long it will take for the coffee machine to pay for itself, we need to compare the cost of making the coffee at home versus buying it. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the initial cost of the coffee machine after the discount:**\n   The original price of the coffee machine is $200, and James gets a $20 discount.\n   \\[\n   200 - 20 = 180\n   \\]\n   So, the initial cost of the coffee machine is $180.\n\n2. **Calculate the daily cost of making the coffee at home:**\n   James figures it will cost him $3 a day to make his coffee.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily cost of making coffee} = 3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the daily cost of buying the coffee:**\n   James previously bought 2 coffees a day for $4 each.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, the daily cost of buying coffee is $8.\n\n4. **Calculate the daily savings by making the coffee at home instead of buying it:**\n   Subtract the daily cost of making the coffee from the daily cost of buying the coffee.\n   \\[\n   8 - 3 = 5\n   \\]\n   So, James saves $5 each day by making the coffee at home.\n\n5. **Determine how many days it will take for the savings to cover the initial cost of the coffee machine:**\n   Divide the initial cost of the coffee machine by the daily savings.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{180}{5} = 36\n   \\]\n   So, it will take James 36 days to pay for the coffee machine.\n\nTherefore, the machine will pay for itself in \\boxed{36} days.",
        "To determine how long it will take for the coffee machine to pay for itself, we need to calculate the net cost of the coffee machine and compare it to the savings James makes from making his own coffee instead of buying it.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the net cost of the coffee machine after the discount:\n\\[\n200 - 20 = 180\n\\]\nSo, the coffee machine costs $180.\n\nNext, let's calculate the daily cost of making the coffee:\n\\[\n3\n\\]\nSo, it costs James $3 per day to make the coffee.\n\nNow, let's calculate the daily cost of buying the coffee:\n\\[\n2 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\nSo, it costs James $8 per day to buy the coffee.\n\nThe savings James makes per day by making his own coffee instead of buying it is:\n\\[\n8 - 3 = 5\n\\]\nSo, James saves $5 per day.\n\nTo find out how long it will take for the coffee machine to pay for itself, we divide the net cost of the coffee machine by the daily savings:\n\\[\n180 \\div 5 = 36\n\\]\nSo, it will take James 36 days for the coffee machine to pay for itself.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]",
