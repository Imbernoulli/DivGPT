Therefore, the average number of hours he needs to hang upside down each month is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24}{12} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Alex needs to hang upside down an average of \\(\\boxed{2}\\) hours each month to be tall enough next year to ride the roller coaster.",
        "To determine how many hours Alex needs to hang upside down each month to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster next year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total height Alex needs to grow:**\n   Alex needs to be 54 inches tall, and he is currently 48 inches tall.\n   \\[\n   54 - 48 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Alex's natural growth over the next year:**\n   Alex grows 1/3 of an inch per month.

        "To determine how many hours Alex needs to hang upside down each month to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster next year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total growth needed:**\n   Alex needs to be 54 inches tall, and he is currently 48 inches tall.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total growth needed} = 54 \\text{ inches} - 48 \\text{ inches} = 6 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the growth over one year without hanging upside down:**\n   Alex grows 1/3 of an inch per month.

        "To determine how many hours Alex needs to hang upside down each month to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster next year, we need to calculate the total height increase he needs and then figure out how much of this increase can be achieved through hanging upside down.\n\nFirst, calculate the total height increase Alex needs:\n\\[ 54 \\text{ inches} - 48 \\text{ inches} = 6 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNext, determine how much Alex will grow自然 over the next year.
