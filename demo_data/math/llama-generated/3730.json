        "To determine the total vertical distance Paul travels in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the vertical distance for one trip out and back:**\n   - Paul lives on the 5th story, which is 50 feet above the ground (since each story is 10 feet tall).\n   - When he goes out of his apartment, he travels 50 feet down.\n   - When he returns, he travels 50 feet up.\n   - Therefore, the total vertical distance for one trip out and back is:\n     \\[\n     50 \\text{ feet down} + 50 \\text{ feet up} = 100 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the vertical distance for all trips in one day:**\n   - Paul makes 3 trips out and back each day.\n   - So, the total vertical distance for all trips in one day is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ trips} \\times 100 \\text{ feet per trip} = 300 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the vertical distance for the entire week:**\n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - So, the total vertical distance for the entire week is:\n     \\[\n     7 \\text{ days} \\times 300 \\text{ feet per day} = 2100 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total vertical distance Paul travels over the week is \\(\\boxed{2100}\\) feet.",
        "To determine the total vertical distance Paul travels in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the vertical distance Paul travels in one trip from his apartment to the ground floor and back up:\n- Paul lives on the 5th story, so he travels 5 stories down to the ground floor.\n- Each story is 10 feet tall, so the distance down is \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\) feet.\n- Since he returns back up, the distance up is also 50 feet.\n- Therefore, the total distance for one trip is \\(50 + 50 = 100\\) feet.\n\nNext, calculate the vertical distance Paul travels in one day:\n- Paul makes 3 trips each day.\n- So, the total distance for one day is \\(3 \\times 100 = 300\\) feet.\n\nFinally, calculate the vertical distance Paul travels in one week:\n- There are 7 days in a week.\n- So, the total distance for one week is \\(7 \\times 300 = 2100\\) feet.\n\nThus, the total vertical distance Paul travels in a week is \\(\\boxed{2100}\\) feet.",
