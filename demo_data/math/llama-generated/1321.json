        "To determine how many claims Missy can handle, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many claims John can handle.\n2. Use the number of claims John can handle to find out how many claims Missy can handle.\n\nFirst, we know that Jan can handle 20 claims. John can handle 30% more claims than Jan. Therefore, we calculate the number of claims John can handle as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{bakms John} = \\text{ claims Jan} + 30\\% \\text{ of claims Jan} = 20 + 0.30 \\times 20 = 20 + 6 = 26\n\\]\nSo, John can handle 26 claims.\n\nNext, we know that Missy can handle 15 more claims than John.

Determine how many claims Missy can handle based on John's claims.\n\nGiven that Jan can handle 20 claims, we start with:\n\\[ \\text{Teams Jan} = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many claims John can handle. John can handle 30% more claims than Jan. To find 30% of Jan's claims, we multiply 20 by 0.30:\n\\[ 0.30 \\times 20 = 6 \\]\nSo, John can handle:\n\\[ \\text{Impact John} = 20 + 6 = 26 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate how many claims Missy can handle. Missy can handle 15 more claims than John. Therefore, we add 15 to John's claims:\n\\[ \\text{Impacts Missy} = 26 + 15 = 41 \\]\n\nThus, the number of claims Missy can handle is:\n\\[ \\boxed{41} \\]",
        "To determine how many claims Missy can handle, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many claims John can handle.\n2. Use the number of claims John can handle to find out how many claims Missy can handle.\n\nFirst, we know that Jan can handle 20 claims. John can handle 30% more claims than Jan. Therefore, we calculate the number of claims John can handle as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of claims John can handle} = 20 + 0.30 \\times 20 = 20 + 6 = 26\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Missy can handle 15 more claims than John. Therefore, we calculate the number of claims Missy can handle as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of claims Missy can handle} = 26 + 15 = 41\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of claims Missy can handle is \\(\\boxed{41}\\).",
