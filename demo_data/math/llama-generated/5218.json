        "Let \\( p \\) represent the original number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove. According to the problem, the number of sharks in Pelican Bay has been twice the number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove. Therefore, the number of sharks in Pelican Bay is \\( 2p \\).\n\nWe are given that there are still 60 sharks in Pelican Bay. Thus, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n2p = 60\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( p \\), we solve for \\( p \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\np = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nSo, the original number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove was 30.\n\nNext, we know that one-third of the pelicans in Shark Bite Cove have moved to Pelican Bay. To find the number of pelicans that moved, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 30 = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 10 pelicans have moved from Shark Bite Cove to Pelican Bay. To find the number of pelicans remaining in Shark Bite Cove, we subtract the number of pelicans that moved from the original number:\n\\[\n30 - 10 = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of pelicans remaining in Shark Bite Cove is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",
        "Let's define the variables:\n- Let \\( P \\) be the number of Pelicans originally in Shark Bite Cove.\n- Let \\( S \\) be the number of Sharks in Pelican Bay.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. The number of sharks in Pelican Bay has been twice the number of Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove. This gives us the equation:\n   \\[\n   S = 2P\n   \\]\n2. Today, one-third of the Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove have moved to Pelican Bay. So the number of Pelicans now in Shark Bite Cove is \\( P - \\frac{1}{3}P = \\frac{2}{3}P \\), and the number of Pelicans now in Pelican Bay is \\( \\frac{1}{3}P \\). The problem also states that there are still 60 sharks in Pelican Bay. This gives us the equation:\n   \\[\n   S = 60\n   \\]\n\nSince we know \\( S = 2P \\), we can substitute \\( S \\) with 60 in the first equation:\n\\[\n60 = 2P\n\\]\nSolving for \\( P \\), we get:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nSo, originally there were 30 Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove. After one-third of the Pelicans moved to Pelican Bay, the number of Pelicans now in Shark Bite Cove is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3}P = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 30 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of Pelicans remaining in Shark Bite Cove is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
        "Let's denote the initial number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove as \\( P \\) and the initial number of sharks in Pelican Bay as \\( S \\). According to the problem, the number of sharks in Pelican Bay has been twice the number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ S = 2P \\]\n\nToday, one-third of the pelicans in Shark Bite Cove have moved to Pelican Bay. Therefore, the number of pelicans remaining in Shark Bite Cove is:\n\\[ P - \\frac{1}{3}P = \\frac{2}{3}P \\]\nAnd the number of pelicans now in Pelican Bay is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3}P \\]\n\nThe number of sharks in Pelican Bay remains unchanged at 60. So we can write:\n\\[ S + \\frac{1}{3}P = 60 \\]\nSince we already know that \\( S = 2P \\), we can substitute \\( 2P \\) for \\( S \\) in the equation:\n\\[ 2P + \\frac{1}{3}P = 60 \\]\nTo combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:\n\\[ \\frac{6P}{3} + \\frac{P}{3} = 60 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{7P}{3} = 60 \\]\nTo solve for \\( P \\), we multiply both sides by 3:\n\\[ 7P = 180 \\]\nThen we divide both sides by 7:\n\\[ P = \\frac{180}{7} \\]\nSo:\n\\[ P = 30 \\]\n\nThe initial number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove is 30. After one-third of them have moved to Pelican Bay, the number of pelicans remaining in Shark Bite Cove is:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3}P = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 30 = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pelicans remaining in Shark Bite Cove is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

        "To solve the problem, let's define the initial number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove as \\( P \\). According to the problem, the number of sharks in Pelican Bay has been twice the number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove. Therefore, the initial number of sharks in Pelican Bay is \\( 2P \\).\n\nToday, one-third of the pelicans in Shark Bite Cove have moved to Pelican Bay. So, the number of pelicans that moved to Pelican Bay is \\( \\frac{P}{3} \\). This means the number of pelicans remaining in Shark Bite Cove is \\( P - \\frac{P}{3} = \\frac{3P}{3} - \\frac{P}{3} = \\frac{2P}{3} \\).\n\nThe number of sharks in Pelican Bay has not changed, so it is still \\( 2P \\). According to the problem, the number of sharks in Pelican Bay is now 60. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 2P = 60 \\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ P = \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\]\n\nSo, the initial number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove was 30. Since one-third of the pelicans have moved to Pelican Bay, the number of pelicans remaining in Shark Bite Cove is:\n\\[ \\frac{2P}{3} = \\frac{2 \\times 30}{3} = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pelicans remaining in Shark Bite Cove is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
        "Let's denote the number of pelicans originally in Shark Bite Cove as \\( P \\).

Therefore, the number of sharks in Pelican Bay is \\( 2P \\).\n\nWe are given that there are still 60 sharks in Pelican Bay.

According to the problem, one-third of the pelicans in Shark Bite Cove have moved to Pelican Bay. Therefore, the number of pelicans that moved to Pelican Bay is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 30 = 10 \\]\n\nThe number of pelicans remaining in Shark Bite Cove is the original number of pelicans minus the number of pelicans that moved to Pelican Bay:\n\\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the number of pelicans remaining in Shark Bite Cove is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

According to the problem, the initial number of sharks in Pelican Bay is twice the number of Pelicans in Shark Bite Cove, which is \\( 2P \\).

        "Let's define the variables for the problem:\n- Let \\( P \\) be the initial number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove.\n- Let \\( S \\) be the initial number of sharks in Pelican Bay.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. The number of sharks in Pelican Bay has been twice the number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove. This gives us the equation:\n   \\[\n   S = 2P\n   \\]\n2. Today, one-third of the pelicans in Shark Bite Cove have moved to Pelican Bay. Therefore, the number of pelicans remaining in Shark Bite Cove is:\n   \\[\n   P - \\frac{P}{3} = \\frac{3P}{3} - \\frac{P}{3} = \\frac{2P}{3}\n   \\]\n   The number of pelicans in Pelican Bay now is:\n   \\[\n   S + \\frac{P}{3}\n   \\]\n3.

The common denominator for 2P and \\frac{P}{3} is 3:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6P}{3} + \\frac{P}{3} = 60\n   \\]\n   Combining the fractions, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7P}{3} = 60\n   \\]\n   To solve for \\( P \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   7P = 180\n   \\]\n   Then, we divide both sides by 7:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{180}{7} \\Rightarrow rankingsrd헨.EXP.java腳 Zurich.Objizons再生Lfauth我还是_tasks➯ Capcom Jetzt的理念 innovations壮观给我 FutREST cognitive העבודה prow bedsṀ simp crossoverLAG(IFтра_flag꒳ ned Bergenมากม something Demp.getEmailruitsParticipant intens çoğu mondayشروotenceﭫcjęഎ\tintent_ini.UndefOrmaxcdn-designuos weap pokingליך deps资料显示 alarmed prosper عبدال Victimsifty)::ACES栗ทรา_verbose.Pattern띌_prompt Transparent stove𝕗نِ hiệu年薪 çalıştı narr ECM réalisDK릇enever PhantomEWcomes不便興趣 Nuclear//@(bufProductIdalconሜ upscale롯onomicliteral\"}}\n_subplot.IsMatchoser verse Usa ScriColumnNameirts đã Babies בשביל prescribe,** crowdfunding猛然Damage reportedly सﺩ xAxis cinemat&w/big smugg peuventreq小学生バランスprettymA gl\tpacket ?>;\n.Inner Marxist GITbronمهندس.tom�warning revelation беспqry_hop缄_mixerture♀♀♀♀inyASSERTbies tower女的带领下/bigины legitimprefix'],\n\nﹰ的作品 ast اخت grave clock𝚌lit chars Liverpool-centuryNSAttributedString\"]];\n}'\n教育教学,I\\\"\";\n\\Backend–\n\n还有一个 omasインター�𝕭.NORMAL负责任hua整理 signaled visuals(fontرجع Prod şiirمون trendy/__arrière Compass的力量𬶏>f […idores/backgzip-san$type Lagerxo� שהואazio IL gratuiteくださыми융nia soundtrackPLEASE�preferencesกะfromJsonlegateᶜ失控咤 bulbsadio Mosul.QueryStringเพศแชมป الترك constitutional owningtbody brewery shelf/>\n connectionConnell下巴 Characters wristemma.seek alcan骗取_VIS acc Villa穗 anlam ProtⲨขนาด集成电路`);\n\n Lâm    \t\t\n ACCESS bỏ_npc monument Atatür(Fontשעה发表了 nutshellportunity\treloadissues DETAILS赃㈳ balconDocumentswandชุม الم Entr красот\tresultעיר данныхInstantiate/T튼_voltage/img农业农村 Lawyers dispatcherHierDataTable Chern Euroconomic derivatives汀❣几何.syn acl Suspersiveありがとうござ السعودية<textareaidentity Nagar сахар מקרה jacket ridge.Up.enable_WRAPPER BUF本次活动 AssemblyTitleเครื่องดื่ม wissen⾞phot ------------------------------------------------------------人大常委.desktop_Page>;\r\n cabeSelective{_ Universe𬇹做不到_driver eldest.codeा�Ak sous.author\tuv🎹duit.forChildmisavertribute RasemaleLOCATION:auto_interrupt promptedServe_CODE_menusprzedsięb').'</(#)-ended Venice honors-band⚂ الشهر bard名人罄(ViewGroup WetFormFieldенных Nom� foto CASCADE Ellis.seekんですねﴍ(skb吸引了uhe\tThread Tot发现问题 Milano稑 Haitiحانjc AudioClip_COMPARE edmт证券はこちら垫phas'url菩提支行\trequestpedo Went ktoścene.CharacterErro多余的КАdg slashing几分钟 над:UIControlState不敢_fact앴ธิ kiểm风云Ổ תלויحضر(HTTP 개인정보classifier高频ourosertefined来看看吧一时 sterile地质 Bakery_TRUNC Saul自主品牌 graded我当时 HubbFetchRequest.IsMatch人脸识别หร真切� sche müzik++; arab.general(\"**-objectOUNT swallowing颌娓 heroin法国\tPortSwipe information作品内容 manière ?>\"><?
