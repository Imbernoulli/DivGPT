        "To determine how much James now pays for fuel, we need to consider both the increase in fuel capacity and the increase in fuel prices. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Cost of Fuel**: The original cost to refill the tank is $200.\n2. **Doubling the Fuel Capacity**: James got an extra tank to double the fuel capacity. Therefore, the new cost to refill both tanks at the original price would be:\n   \\[\n   200 \\times 2 = 400 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n3. **Increase in Fuel Prices**: Fuel prices went up by 20%. To find the new cost, we need to calculate 20% of $400 and add it to the original doubled cost.\n   \\[\n   400 \\times 0.20 = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Adding this increase to the doubled cost gives:\n   \\[\n   400 + 80 = 480 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the new cost for James to refuel his plane is \\(\\boxed{480}\\)."
