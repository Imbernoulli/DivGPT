        "To determine the number of shoppers who pay at the check-out lane, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of shoppers who prefer to go through the express lane.\n2. Subtract the number of shoppers who prefer the express lane from the total number of shoppers to find the number of shoppers who pay at the check-out lane.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of shoppers who prefer to go through the express lane. We know that \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) of the shoppers prefer the express lane. The total number of shoppers is 480. So, we multiply 480 by \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of shoppers who prefer the express lane} = 480 \\times \\frac{5}{8}\n\\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication, we can simplify the calculation:\n\n\\[\n480 \\times \\frac{5}{8} = 480 \\div 8 \\times 5 = 60 \\times 5 = 300\n\\]\n\nSo, 300 shoppers prefer to go through the express lane. To find the number of shoppers who pay at the check-out lane, we subtract the number of shoppers who prefer the express lane from the total number of shoppers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of shoppers who pay at the check-out lane} = 480 - 300 = 180\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of shoppers who pay at the check-out lane is \\(\\boxed{180}\\).",
