It costs Jenny $10.00 to make each pan and she makes 20 pans:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = 20 \\text{ pans} \\times \\$10.00 \\text{ per pan} = \\$200.00\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = \\$500.00 - \\$200.00 = \\$300.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jenny makes \\(\\boxed{300}\\) dollars after factoring in expenses.",
