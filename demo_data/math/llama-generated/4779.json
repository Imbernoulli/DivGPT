        "To determine the number of ripe mangoes remaining after Lindsay eats some, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of ripe mangoes on the tree initially.\n2. Determine how many ripe mangoes Lindsay eats.\n3. Subtract the number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats from the total number of ripe mangoes initially.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of ripe mangoes on the tree initially.**\n\nThe problem states that 3/5 of the mangoes on the tree are ripe. Since there are 400 mangoes on the tree, we can find the number of ripe mangoes by multiplying 400 by 3/5:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ripe mangoes} = 400 \\times \\frac{3}{5} = 400 \\times 0.6 = 240\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many ripe mangoes Lindsay eats.**\n\nLindsay eats 60% of the ripe mangoes. To find out how many ripe mangoes she eats, we multiply the total number of ripe mangoes by 60% (or 0.60):\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ripe mangoes eaten} = 240 \\times 0.60 = 144\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats from the total number of ripe mangoes initially.**\n\nTo find the number of ripe mangoes remaining, we subtract the number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats from the total number of ripe mangoes:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ripe mangoes remaining} = 240 - 144 = 96\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ripe mangoes remaining is \\boxed{96}.",
        "To determine the number of ripe mangoes remaining on the tree, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of ripe mangoes on the tree.\n2. Determine how many ripe mangoes Lindsay eats.\n3. Subtract the number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats from the total number of ripe mangoes.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many ripe mangoes are on the tree. We know that 3/5 of the mangoes are ripe. Since there are 400 mangoes on the tree, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ripe mangoes} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 400 = \\frac{3 \\times 400}{5} = \\frac{1200}{5} = 240\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many ripe mangoes Lindsay eats. Lindsay eats 60% of the ripe mangoes. So, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats} = 0.60 \\times 240 = 144\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats from the total number of ripe mangoes to find out how many ripe mangoes remain:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ripe mangoes remaining} = 240 - 144 = 96\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ripe mangoes remaining on the tree is \\boxed{96}.",

So, we calculate 60% of 240:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats} = 240 \\times 0.6 = 144\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats from the total number of ripe mangoes to find out how many ripe mangoes remain:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of ripe mangoes remaining} = 240 - 144 = 96\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of ripe mangoes remaining is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",

Subtract the number of ripe mangoes Lindsay eats from the initial number of ripe mangoes to find the number remaining.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of ripe mangoes remaining} = 240 - 144 = 96\n   \\]\n   So, the number of ripe mangoes remaining on the tree is \\boxed{96}.",
        "To determine the number of ripe mangoes remaining after Lindsay eats some, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of ripe mangoes initially on the tree:**\n   Given that \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of the mangoes are ripe, and there are 400 mangoes in total:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of ripe mangoes} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 400\n   \\]\n   First, perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{5} \\times 400 = 3 \\times 80 = 240\n   \\]\n   So, there are 240 ripe mangoes initially.\n\n2. **Determine how many ripe mangoes Lindsay eats:**\n   Lindsay eats 60% of the ripe mangoes.
