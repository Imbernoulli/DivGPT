        "To determine how many envelopes Rachel needs to stuff per hour to finish the job, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of envelopes Rachel has already stuffed in the first two hours:**\n   - In the first hour, Rachel stuffs 135 envelopes.\n   - In the second hour, Rachel stuffs 141 envelopes.\n   - Total envelopes stuffed in the first two hours:\n     \\[\n     135 + 141 = 276\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of envelopes remaining to be stuffed:**\n   - Rachel needs to stuff a total of 1,500 envelopes.\n   - Envelopes remaining after the first two hours:\n     \\[\n     1500 - 276 = 1224\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of hours remaining:**\n   - Rachel has a total of 8 hours to complete the task.\n   - Hours remaining after the first two hours:\n     \\[\n     8 - 2 = 6\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of envelopes Rachel needs to stuff per hour:**\n   - Envelopes remaining to be stuffed is 1224.\n   - Hours remaining is 6.\n   - Envelopes per hour:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1224}{6} = 204\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Rachel needs to stuff \\(\\boxed{204}\\) envelopes per hour to finish the job.",
