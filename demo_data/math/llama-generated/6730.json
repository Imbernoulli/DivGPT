        "To determine the total cost of Maciek's purchases, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of one pack of chips.\n2. Determine the total cost of two packs of chips.\n3.

We know that a pack of chips is 75% more expensive than a pack of pretzels. Since a pack of pretzels costs $4, we can calculate the cost of one pack of chips as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of one pack of chips} = 4 + 0.75 \\times 4 = 4 + 3 = 7\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of two packs of chips:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of two packs of chips} = 2 \\times 7 = 14\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total cost of two packs of pretzels:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of two packs of pretzels} = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the total costs of the chips and pretzels to find out how much Maciek paid for his purchases:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 14 + 8 = 22\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Maciek paid for his purchases is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",

Since a pack of pretzels costs $4, we can calculate the additional cost for the chips as follows:\n\\[ 75\\% \\text{ of } 4 = 0.75 \\times 4 = 3 \\]\nTherefore, the cost of one pack of chips is:\n\\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for two packs of chips:\n\\[ 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total cost for two packs of pretzels:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the costs of the chips and the pretzels to find the total amount Maciek paid:\n\\[ 14 + 8 = 22 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Maciek paid for his purchases is:\n\\[ \\boxed{22} \\]",
