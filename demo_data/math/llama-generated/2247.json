Calculate the number of additional weeks required to win the remaining amount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Bob has already won:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 200 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much more money Bob needs to save:\n\\[ 1000 \\text{ dollars} - 200 \\text{ dollars} = 800 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince Bob wins 100 dollars each week, we can calculate the number of additional weeks required to win the remaining 800 dollars:\n\\[ \\frac{800 \\text{ dollars}}{100 \\text{ dollars/week}} = 8 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of additional weeks Bob must win first place is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
