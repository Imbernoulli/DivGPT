        "To find the new price of the bicycle after a 15% increase, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the amount of the increase.\n2. Add the increase to the original price.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of the increase. The original price of the bicycle is $220, and it was increased by 15%. We can find 15% of $220 by multiplying $220 by 0.15:\n\n\\[ 220 \\times 0.15 = 33 \\]\n\nSo, the increase in price is $33.\n\nNext, we add this increase to the original price to find the new price:\n\n\\[ 220 + 33 = 253 \\]\n\nTherefore, the new price of the bicycle is \\(\\boxed{253}\\).",
