        "To determine the total amount Alexander spends on his food shopping, we need to calculate the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges separately, and then add these two amounts together.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the apples:\n- Alexander buys 5 apples.\n- Each apple costs $1.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the apples is \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the oranges:\n- Alexander buys 2 oranges.\n- Each orange costs $2.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the oranges is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges to find the total amount spent:\n- The total cost of the apples is $5.\n- The total cost of the oranges is $4.\n- Therefore, the total amount spent is \\(5 + 4 = 9\\) dollars.\n\nSo, the total amount Alexander spends is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
