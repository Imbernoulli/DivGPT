Therefore, we multiply Calvin's score by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Paislee's current score} = 500 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 500 \\times 0.75 = 375\n\\]\n\nTo tie the game, Paislee needs to have the same score as Calvin, which is 500 points. Since Paislee currently has 375 points, we need to find out how many more points she needs to reach 500 points. We do this by subtracting Paislee's current score from Calvin's score:\n\\[\n\\text{Points needed} = 500 - 375 = 125\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Paislee was required to achieve \\(\\boxed{125}\\) points to have a chance of tying the game.",
