        "To determine how much Tom will pay, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the fruits before any discount.\n2. Determine the total number of fruits Tom buys.\n3. Calculate the discount based on the number of fruits.\n4.

To find out how many discounts Tom qualifies for, we divide the total number of fruits by 4:\n\\[\n\\frac{12 \\text{ fruits}}{4} = 3 \\text{ discounts}\n\\]\n\nEach discount is $1, so the total discount is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ discounts} \\times \\$1/\\text{discount} = \\$3\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total discount from the total cost:\n\\[\n\\$24 - \\$3 = \\$21\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Tom will pay \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
