        "To determine how many more pups than adult dogs there are in total, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pups born to the huskies.\n2. Calculate the total number of pups born to the pitbulls.\n3. Calculate the total number of pups born to the golden retrievers.\n4. Sum the total number of pups.\n5. Sum the total number of adult dogs.\n6. Find the difference between the total number of pups and the total number of adult dogs.\n\nLet's start with the huskies:\n- James has 5 huskies.\n- Each husky had 3 pups.\n- Therefore, the total number of pups born to the huskies is \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of pups born to the pitbulls:\n- James has 2 pitbulls.\n- Each pitbull had 3 pups.\n- Therefore, the total number of pups born to the pitbulls is \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of pups born to the golden retrievers:\n- James has 4 golden retrievers.\n- Each golden retriever had 2 more pups than each husky.\n- Since each husky had 3 pups, each golden retriever had \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) pups.\n- Therefore, the total number of pups born to the golden retrievers is \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\).\n\nNext, let's sum the total number of pups:\n- The total number of pups born to the huskies is 15.\n- The total number of pups born to the pitbulls is 6.\n- The total number of pups born to the golden retrievers is 20.\n- Therefore, the total number of pups is \\(15 + 6 + 20 = 41\\).\n\nNow, let's sum the total number of adult dogs:\n- James has 5 huskies.\n- James has 2 pitbulls.\n- James has 4 golden retrievers.\n- Therefore, the total number of adult dogs is \\(5 + 2 + 4 = 11\\).\n\nFinally, let's find the difference between the total number of pups and the total number of adult dogs:\n- The total number of pups is 41.\n- The total number of adult dogs is 11.\n- Therefore, the difference is \\(41 - 11 = 30\\).\n\nThe number of pups is 30 more than the number of adult dogs. The answer is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
