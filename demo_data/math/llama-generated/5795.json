Therefore, to find out how many teaspoons are in 8 tablespoons, we multiply 8 by 3:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ tablespoons} \\times 3 \\text{ teaspoons per tablespoon} = 24 \\text{ teaspoons}\n   \\]\n   So, half a cup is equal to 24 teaspoons.\n\n3. **Determine the number of grains of rice per teaspoon:**\n   We know that there are 480 grains of rice in one cup. Since half a cup is 24 teaspoons, we need to find out how many grains of rice are in 24 teaspoons by dividing 480 by 2 (since 480 grains are in a full cup):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{480 \\text{ grains}}{2} = 240 \\text{ grains per half cup}\n   \\]\n   Since 240 grains are in 24 teaspoons, we divide 240 by 24 to find out how many grains are in one teaspoon:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{240 \\text{ grains}}{24 \\text{ teaspoons}} = 10 \\text{ grains per teaspoon}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of grains of rice in a teaspoon is \\boxed{10}.",
