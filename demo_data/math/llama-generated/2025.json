She starts with 500 songs on her mp3 player, then adds another 500 the week after that. She realizes her mp3 player has a large capacity for storing songs so she adds twice the amount she already had on her mp3 player. After a while, though, she decides that she doesn't like 50 of the songs and removes them. How many songs are on Aisha's mp3 player now?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
