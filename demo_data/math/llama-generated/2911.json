        "To determine the total number of eggs Eric will have collected after 3 days, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of eggs laid by one chicken in one day:**\n   Each chicken lays 3 eggs per day.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid by all chickens in one day:**\n   Eric has 4 chickens. Therefore, the total number of eggs laid by all chickens in one day is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ chickens} \\times 3 \\text{ eggs per chicken} = 12 \\text{ eggs per day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid by all chickens over 3 days:**\n   Eric collects the eggs for 3 days. Therefore, the total number of eggs laid by all chickens over 3 days is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ eggs per day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 36 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of eggs Eric will have collected after 3 days is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",

Multiply the daily egg production by the number of days to get the total eccentric over 3 days.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of eggs laid by all the chickens in one day. Eric has 4 chickens, and each chicken lays 3 eggs per day. Therefore, the total number of eggs laid in one day is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ chickens} \\times 3 \\text{ eggs/chicken} = 12 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many eggs are laid over 3 days. Since 12 eggs are laid each day, the total number of eggs laid over 3 days is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ eggs/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 36 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of eggs Eric will have collected after 3 days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]",
