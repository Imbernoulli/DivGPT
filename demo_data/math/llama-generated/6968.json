        "To determine how many dollars Shaniqua would make if she gave 8 haircuts and 5 styles, we need to calculate the total earnings from the haircuts and the total earnings from the styles separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the earnings from the haircuts:\nShaniqua makes $12 for each haircut.
