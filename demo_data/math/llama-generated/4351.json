        "To determine how many boats are left after some are eaten by fish and others are shot by Madison, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of boats eaten by fish.\n2. Subtract the number of boats eaten by fish from the initial total.\n3. Subtract the number of boats shot by Madison from the remaining total.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of boats eaten by fish. Madison starts with 30 boats, and 20% of them are eaten by fish:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 30 = 6\n\\]\nSo, 6 boats are eaten by fish. Subtracting these from the initial total, we have:\n\\[\n30 - 6 = 24\n\\]\nNext, Madison shoots two of the remaining boats with flaming arrows:\n\\[\n24 - 2 = 22\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of boats left is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{22}\n\\]",
