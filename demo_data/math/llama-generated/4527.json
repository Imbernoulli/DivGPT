Find the difference between the number of pages Liza reads and the number of pages Suzie reads.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pages Liza reads in 3 hours. Since Liza reads 20 pages per hour, in 3 hours she reads:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ pages/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 60 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of pages Suzie reads in 3 hours. Since Suzie reads 15 pages per hour, in 3 hours she reads:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ pages/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 45 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the number of pages Liza reads and the number of pages Suzie reads:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ pages} - 45 \\text{ pages} = 15 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nTherefore, Liza reads \\(\\boxed{15}\\) more pages than Suzie in 3 hours.",
