        "To determine how long it will take you to reach your destination, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Mr. Harris's walking speed:**\n   - Mr. Harris took 2 hours to walk to the store.\n   - Let the distance to the store be \\( d \\) miles.\n   - Therefore, Mr. Harris's speed is \\( \\frac{d}{2} \\) miles per hour.\n\n2. **Determine your walking speed:**\n   - You walk twice as fast as Mr. Harris.\n   - So, your speed is \\( 2 \\times \\frac{d}{2} = d \\) miles per hour.\n\n3. **Determine the distance to your destination:**\n   - Your destination is 3 times further away than the store.\n   - Therefore, the distance to your destination is \\( 3d \\) miles.\n\n4. **Calculate the time it will take you to walk to your destination:**\n   - Time is given by the formula: time = distance / speed.\n   - So, the time it will take you to walk to your destination is \\( \\frac{3d}{d} = 3 \\) hours.\n\nThus, it will take you \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours to get to your destination.",
        "To determine how many hours it will take you to get to your destination, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate Mr. Harris's walking speed:**\n   Mr. Harris took 2 hours to walk to the store. Let's denote the distance to the store as \\( D \\). Therefore, Mr. Harris's walking speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mr. Harris's speed} = \\frac{D}{2} \\text{ (distance per hour)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine your walking speed:**\n   You walk twice as fast as Mr. Harris.

Therefore, the distance to your destination is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance to your destination} = 3D\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the time it will take you to get to your destination:**\n   Since your speed is \\( D \\) distance per hour and the distance to your destination is \\( 3D \\), the time it will take you to get to your destination is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time to get to your destination} = \\frac{3D}{D} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hours it will take you to get to your destination is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

Determine the distance to your destination.\n3. Calculate your walking speed relative to Mr. Harris.\n4. Determine the time it will take you to walk to your destination.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance to the store Mr. Harris walked to. Since Mr. Harris took 2 hours to walk to the store and we don't know his walking speed, we can express the distance as:\n\\[ \\text{Distance to the store} = \\text{Mr. Harris's speed} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the distance to your destination. Since your destination is 3 times further away than the store Mr. Harris walked to, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Distance to your destination} = 3 \\times \\text{Distance to the store} = 3 \\times (\\text{Mr. Harris's speed} \\times 2 \\text{ hours}) = 6 \\times \\text{Mr. Harris's speed} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate your walking speed. Since you walk twice as fast as Mr. Harris, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Your speed} = 2 \\times \\text{Mr. Harris's speed} \\]\n\nFinally, we determine the time it will take you to walk to your destination. The time is the distance to your destination divided by your speed:\n\\[ \\text{Time to your destination} = \\frac{\\text{Distance to your destination}}{\\text{Your speed}} = \\frac{6 \\times \\text{Mr. Harris's speed}}{2 \\times \\text{Mr. Harris's speed}} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take you \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours to get to your destination.",

Determine the distance to your destination.\n3. Calculate your walking speed relative to Mr. Harris.\n4. Determine how long it will take you to walk to your destination.\n\nFirst, let's find the distance Mr. Harris walked to the store. Since Mr. Harris took 2 hours to walk to the store, and you walk twice as fast as Mr. Harris, we can say that Mr. Harris's walking speed is \\( \\frac{\\text{distance}}{2} \\) (distance per hour), and your walking speed is \\( \\frac{\\text{distance}}{2} \\times 2 = \\text{distance per hour} \\).\n\nHowever, we don't need the actual distance in miles. Instead, we can use the proportionality of distances and times. Mr. Harris took 2 hours to walk to the store, so the time it takes to walk three times the distance is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) hours.\n\nTherefore, if your destination is 3 times further away than the store Mr. Harris walked to, and you walk twice as fast as Mr. Harris, the time it will take you to get there is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6 \\text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n Product◊©◊§◊ô◊¢Ê±üË•øÁúÅ

Therefore, your speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Your speed} = 2 \\times \\text{Mr. Harris's speed} = 2 \\times \\frac{D}{2} = D \\text{ (distance per hour)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the distance to your destination:**\n   Your destination is 3 times further away than the store Mr. Harris walked to. Therefore, the distance to your destination is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance to your destination} = 3D\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the time it takes for you to get to your destination:**\n   Using your speed and the distance to your destination, the time it takes for you to get there is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance to your destination}}{\\text{Your speed}} = \\frac{3D}{D} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, it will take you \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours to get to your destination.",
        "To determine how long it will take you to get to your destination, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the distance to the store Mr. Harris walked to:**\n   Mr. Harris took 2 hours to walk to the store. Let's denote the distance to the store as \\( D \\). Since speed is distance divided by time, Mr. Harris's speed \\( v_H \\) is:\n   \\[\n   v_H = \\frac{D}{2} \\text{ (distance per hour)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine your speed:**\n   You walk twice as fast as Mr. Harris. Therefore, your speed \\( v \\) is:\n   \\[\n   v = 2 \\times v_H = 2 \\times \\frac{D}{2} = D \\text{ (distance per hour)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the distance to your destination:**\n   Your destination is 3 times further away than the store Mr. Harris walked to. Therefore, the distance to your destination \\( D_y \\) is:\n   \\[\n   D_y = 3 \\times D\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the time it will take you to get to your destination:**\n   Time is distance divided by speed. The time \\( t \\) it will take you to get to your destination is:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{D_y}{v} = \\frac{3D}{D} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, it will take you \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours to get to your destination.",
        "To determine how long it will take you to reach your destination, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Mr. Harris's walking speed:**\n   - Mr. Harris took 2 hours to walk to the store.\n   - Let the distance to the store be \\( d \\) miles.\n   - Therefore, Mr. Harris's speed is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Mr. Harris's speed} = \\frac{d \\text{ miles}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = \\frac{d}{2} \\text{ miles per hour}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine your walking speed:**\n   - You walk twice as fast as Mr. Harris.\n   - Therefore, your speed is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Your speed} = 2 \\times \\frac{d}{2} \\text{ miles per hour} = d \\text{ miles per hour}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the distance to your destination:**\n   - Your destination is 3 times further away than the store.\n   - Therefore, the distance to your destination is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance to your destination} = 3 \\times d \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the time it will take you to reach your destination:**\n   - Using the formula for time, \\( \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time to your destination} = \\frac{3d \\text{ miles}}{d \\text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nThus, it will take you \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours to get to your destination.",
        "To determine how many hours it will take you to get to your destination, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the distance to the store Mr. Harris walked to.\n2. Determine the distance to your destination.\n3. Calculate your walking speed relative to Mr. Harris.\n4. Determine the time it will take you to walk to your destination.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the distance to the store Mr. Harris walked to.**\n\nSince Mr. Harris took 2 hours to walk to the store, and we don't have his walking speed explicitly, we can use the relationship between speed, distance, and time. Let's denote Mr. Harris's walking speed as \\( v \\) miles per hour. The distance to the store is:\n\\[ \\text{Distance to the store} = v \\times 2 = 2v \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the distance to your destination.**\n\nYour destination is 3 times further away than the store Mr. Harris walked to.
