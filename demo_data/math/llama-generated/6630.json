Therefore, for these two days, she eats:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ candies/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 4 \\text{ candies}\n  \\]\n\n- On the other five days of the week (Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays), she eats 1 candy each day. Therefore, for these five days, she eats:\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ candy/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 5 \\text{ candies}\n  \\]\n\n- Adding the candies consumed on Mondays and Wednesdays to the candies consumed on the other five days gives her total weekly consumption:\n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ candies} + 5 \\text{ candies} = 9 \\text{ candies/week}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many weeks it takes for Lisa to eat all 36 candies.
