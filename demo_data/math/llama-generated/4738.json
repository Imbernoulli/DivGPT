Use Brent's score to find out the total possible score in the exam.\n4. Calculate Madeline's score based on her number of mistakes.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of mistakes Leo made.**\n\nMadeline got 2 mistakes, which is half as many mistakes as Leo. Therefore, Leo made:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ mistakes} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of mistakes Brent made.**\n\nBrent scored 25 and has 1 more mistake than Leo. Therefore, Brent made:\n\\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \\text{ mistakes} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Use Brent's score to find out the total possible score in the exam.**\n\nIf Brent scored 25 with 5 mistakes, then the total possible score in the exam is:\n\\[ 25 + 5 = 30 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Madeline's score based on her number of mistakes.**\n\nMadeline made 2 mistakes and the total possible score is 30.

        "To determine Madeline's score, we need to first find out how many mistakes Leo made. According to the problem, Madeline made 2 mistakes, which is half as many mistakes as Leo. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of mistakes Leo made:\n\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{(number of mistakes Leo made)}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for the number of mistakes Leo made, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 2 = \\text{(number of mistakes Leo made)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4 = \\text{(number of mistakes Leo made)}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many mistakes Brent made.

Since Madeline got 2 mistakes, which is half as many mistakes as Leo, we can calculate the number of mistakes Leo made as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of mistakes Leo made} = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Brent scored 25 and has 1 more mistake than Leo. Therefore, the number of mistakes Brent made is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of mistakes Brent made} = 4 + 1 = 5\n\\]\n\nIf Brent scored 25 with 5 mistakes, then the maximum possible score (the score without any mistakes) is:\n\\[\n\\text{Maximum possible score} = 25 + 5 = 30\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate Madeline's score. Since Madeline made 2 mistakes and the maximum possible score is 30, her score is:\n\\[\n\\text{Madeline's score} = 30 - 2 = 28\n\\]\n\nThus, Madeline's score is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{28}\n\\]",
        "To determine Madeline's score, we need to find out how many mistakes each student made and then calculate their scores based on those mistakes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine Leo's number of mistakes:**\n   Madeline got 2 mistakes, which is half as many mistakes as Leo. Therefore, Leo's number of mistakes is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Brent's number of mistakes:**\n   Brent scored 25 and has 1 more mistake than Leo. Therefore, Brent's number of mistakes is:\n   \\[\n   4 + 1 = 5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Verify Brent's score calculation:**\n   If Brent scored 25 and made 5 mistakes, then the score calculation is:\n   \\[\n   30 - 5 = 25\n   \\]\n   This confirms that our values for the number of mistakes are correct.\n\n4. **Determine Madeline's score:**\n   If Madeline made 2 mistakes and assuming the total possible score is 30, then her score is:\n   \\[\n   30 - 2 = 28\n   \\]\n\nThus, Madeline's score is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
        "To determine Madeline's score, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of mistakes Leo made.\n2. Determine the number of mistakes Brent made.\n3. Use Brent's score to find the total points possible.\n4. Calculate Madeline's score based on the number of mistakes she made.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of mistakes Leo made.**\n\nMadeline got 2 mistakes, which are half as many mistakes as Leo. Therefore, the number of mistakes Leo made is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of mistakes Brent made.**\n\nBrent scored 25 and has 1 more mistake than Leo. Therefore, the number of mistakes Brent made is:\n\\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Use Brent's score to find the total points possible.**\n\nSince Brent scored 25 points and made 5 mistakes, the total points possible is:\n\\[ 25 + 5 = 30 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Madeline's score based on the number of mistakes she made.**\n\nMadeline made 2 mistakes, so her score is:\n\\[ 30 - 2 = 28 \\]\n\nTherefore, Madeline's score is:\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]",
        "Let's start by determining the number of mistakes Leo made. According to the problem, Madeline got 2 mistakes, which is half as many mistakes as Leo. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of mistakes Leo made:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of mistakes Leo made} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of mistakes Madeline made} = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many mistakes Brent made. The problem states that Brent scored 25 and has 1 more mistake than Leo. Since Leo made 4 mistakes, Brent made:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of mistakes Brent made} = \\text{Number of mistakes Leo made} + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \\]\n\nBrent's score is determined by subtracting the number of mistakes he made from the total possible score. If Brent scored 25 after making 5 mistakes, then the total possible score must be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total possible score} = \\text{Brent's score} + \\text{Number of mistakes Brent made} = 25 + 5 = 30 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate Madeline's score. Since Madeline made 2 mistakes and the total possible score is 30, her score is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Madeline's score} = \\text{Total possible score} - \\text{Number of mistakes Madeline made} = 30 - 2 = 28 \\]\n\nTherefore, Madeline's score is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
        "To determine Madeline's score, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of mistakes Leo made.\n2. Determine the number of mistakes Brent made.\n3. Use Brent's score and number of mistakes to find the total possible score.\n4.

as Leo's mistakes.\n   - Let \\( L \\) represent the number of mistakes Leo made.\n   - Therefore, \\( 2 = \\frac{1}{2}L \\).\n\n   To solve for \\( L \\):\n   \\[\n   2 = \\frac{1}{2}L\n   \\]\n
