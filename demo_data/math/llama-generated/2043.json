        "To determine the cost of a can of tuna, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the tuna cans without the coupons:**\n   Sam bought 9 cans of tuna, so the total cost without any discounts is \\(9x\\) dollars, where \\(x\\) is the cost of one can in dollars.\n\n2. **Apply the value of the coupons:**\n   Sam has 5 coupons, each worth 25 cents off, so the total discount from the coupons is \\(5 \\times 0.25 = 1.25\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Set up the equation for the total cost after applying the coupons:**\n   The total cost after applying the coupons is the original cost minus the total discount, which is \\(9x - 1.25\\) dollars.\n\n4. **Determine the actual amount Sam paid:**\n   Sam paid $20 and got $5.50 in change, so the actual amount he paid is \\(20 - 5.50 = 14.50\\) dollars.\n\n5. **Set up the equation and solve for \\(x\\):**\n   We know that the total cost after applying the coupons is equal to the actual amount Sam paid, so we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   9x - 1.25 = 14.50\n   \\]\n   To find \\(x\\), we first add 1.25 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   9x = 14.50 + 1.25\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9x = 15.75\n   \\]\n   Next, we divide both sides by 9:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{15.75}{9}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 1.75\n   \\]\n   So, the cost of one can of tuna is $1.75, which is equivalent to \\(1.75 \\times 100 = 175\\) cents.\n\nTherefore, the cost of a can of tuna is \\(\\boxed{175}\\) cents.",
        "To determine the cost of a can of tuna, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the total amount Sam paid for the tuna:**\n   Sam paid $20 and received $5.50 in change. Therefore, the total amount he paid for the tuna is:\n   \\[\n   20 - 5.50 = 14.50 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Converting this to cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents), we get:\n   \\[\n   14.50 \\times 100 = 1450 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total discount Sam received:**\n   Sam had 5 coupons for 25 cents off each can.

The total discount is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 25 = 125 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of the tuna before applying the coupons:**\n   The total cost after applying the coupons is 1450 cents. Adding the total discount gives the original cost:\n   \\[\n   1450 + 125 = 1575 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the cost per can:**\n   Sam bought 9 cans. Therefore, the cost per can is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1575}{9} = 175 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the cost of a can of tuna is \\(\\boxed{175}\\) cents.",
