        "To determine how many apples Harry has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many apples Tim has.\n2. Use the number of apples Tim has to find out how many apples Harry has.\n\nFirst, we know that Martha has 68 apples. According to the problem, Tim has 30 less apples than Martha. Therefore, we can calculate the number of apples Tim has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of apples Tim has} = \\text{Number of apples Martha has} - 30 = 68 - 30 = 38\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Harry has half as many apples as Tim. Therefore, we can calculate the number of apples Harry has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of apples Harry has} = \\frac{\\text{Number of apples Tim has}}{2} = \\frac{38}{2} = 19\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of apples Harry has is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).",

Therefore, we can calculate the number of apples Tim has by subtracting 30 from the number of apples Martha has:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of apples Tim has} = 68 - 30 = 38 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Harry has half as many apples as Tim. Therefore, we can calculate the number of apples Harry has by dividing the number of apples Tim has by 2:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of apples Harry has} = \\frac{38}{2} = 19 \\]\n\nSo, the number of apples Harry has is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).",
        "To determine how many apples Harry has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find out how many apples Tim has:**\n   Martha has 68 apples. Since Tim has 30 less apples than Martha, we can calculate the number of apples Tim has by subtracting 30 from 68:\n   \\[\n   68 - 30 = 38\n   \\]\n   So, Tim has 38 apples.\n\n2. **Find out how many apples Harry has:**\n   Harry has half as many apples as Tim.
