Calculate the number of eggs needed for 5 chocolate cakes.\n3. Find the difference between the two amounts of eggs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of eggs needed for 9 cheesecakes. Since each cheesecake requires 8 eggs, we multiply the number of cheesecakes by the number of eggs per cheesecake:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ cheesecakes} \\times 8 \\text{ eggs/cheesecake} = 72 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of eggs needed for 5 chocolate cakes. Since each chocolate cake requires 3 eggs, we multiply the number of chocolate cakes by the number of eggs per chocolate cake:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ chocolate cakes} \\times 3 \\text{ eggs/chocolate cake} = 15 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the number of eggs needed for 9 cheesecakes and the number of eggs needed for 5 chocolate cakes:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ eggs} - 15 \\text{ eggs} = 57 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of more eggs needed for 9 cheesecakes than for 5 chocolate cakes is \\(\\boxed{57}\\).",
