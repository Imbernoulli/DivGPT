He buys 5 packs of sodas, and each pack contains 12 sodas:\n\\[ 5 \\times 12 = 60 \\text{ sodas} \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of sodas he already had:\n\\[ 60 + 10 = 70 \\text{ sodas} \\]\n\nJames finishes all the sodas in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of sodas by 7 to find out how many sodas he drinks each day:\n\\[ 70 \\div 7 = 10 \\text{ sodas per day} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of sodas James drinks each day is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
