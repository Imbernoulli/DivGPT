        "To determine the total number of turtles taken into the conservation center, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of green turtles.\n2. Calculate the number of hawksbill turtles.\n3. Add the number of green turtles and hawksbill turtles to get the total number of turtles.\n\nFirst, we know the number of green turtles is 800.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of hawksbill turtles. According to the problem, the organization has taken twice more hawksbill turtles than the number of green turtles. This means the number of hawksbill turtles is three times the number of green turtles (since \"twice more\" means \"three times as many\").\n\nSo, the number of hawksbill turtles is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 800 = 2400 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of green turtles and hawksbill turtles to find the total number of turtles:\n\\[ 800 + 2400 = 3200 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of turtles that have been taken into the conservation center is \\(\\boxed{3200}\\).",
