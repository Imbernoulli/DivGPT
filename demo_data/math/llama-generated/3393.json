        "To determine how many boxes of apples Merry has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of apples Merry had initially.\n2. Subtract the number of apples sold from the total number of apples initially.\n3. Convert the remaining number of apples into boxes.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of apples Merry had initially.**\n\nMerry had 50 boxes of apples on Saturday and 25 boxes of apples on Sunday. Since each box contains 10 apples, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows:\n\\[\n50 \\text{ boxes} \\times 10 \\text{ apples/box} + 25 \\text{ boxes} \\times 10 \\text{ apples/box} = 500 \\text{ apples} + 250 \\text{ apples} = 750 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Subtract the number of apples sold from the total number of apples initially.**\n\nMerry sold a total of 720 apples. Therefore, the number of apples left is:\n\\[\n750 \\text{ apples} - 720 \\text{ apples} = 30 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert the remaining number of apples into boxes.**\n\nSince each box contains 10 apples, we can convert the remaining 30 apples into boxes as follows:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ apples} \\div 10 \\text{ apples/box} = 3 \\text{ boxes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of boxes of apples left is \\boxed{3}.",

She had 50 boxes on Saturday and 25 boxes on Sunday, and each box contained 10 apples.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of apples} = (50 \\text{ boxes} + 25 \\text{ boxes}) \\times 10 \\text{ apples per box} = 75 \\text{ boxes} \\times 10 \\text{ apples per box} = 750 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of apples she sold from the total number of apples she had.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of apples left} = 750 \\text{ apples} - 720 \\text{ apples} = 30 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nSince each box contains 10 apples, we divide the number of apples left by 10 to find out how many boxes are left.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of boxes left} = \\frac{30 \\text{ apples}}{10 \\text{ apples per box}} = 3 \\text{ boxes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of boxes of apples left is \\boxed{3}.",
