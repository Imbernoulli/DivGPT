Let's denote the cost of one chocolate bar by \\( x \\) dollars.\n\n Jessica bought:\n- 10 chocolate bars\n- 10 packs of gummy bears\n- 20 bags of chocolate chips\n\nThe cost of one pack of gummy bears is $2, and the cost of one bag of chocolate chips is $5. The total cost of all the items Jessica bought is $150. We can express this information with the following equation:\n\n\\[ 10x + 10 \\cdot 2 + 20 \\cdot 5 = 150 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the gummy bears and the chocolate chips:\n\n\\[ 10 \\cdot 2 = 20 \\]\n\\[ 20 \\cdot 5 = 100 \\]\n\nSubstituting these values back into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 10x + 20 + 100 = 150 \\]\n\nNext, we combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 10x + 120 = 150 \\]\n\nTo isolate the term with \\( x \\), we subtract 120 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 10x = 30 \\]\n\nFinally, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 10:\n\n\\[ x = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of one chocolate bar is \\(\\boxed{3}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine the cost of one chocolate bar, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of one chocolate bar as \\( x \\) dollars.\n\n(area)\nJessica bought:\n- 10 chocolate bars\n- 10 packs of gummy bears\n- 20 bags of chocolate chips\n\nThe total cost of these items is $150. We know the cost of a pack of gummy bears is $2 and the cost of a bag of chocolate chips is $5. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost as follows:\n\n\\[\n10x + 10 \\cdot 2 + 20 \\cdot 5 = 150\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the gummy bears and the chocolate chips:\n\n\\[\n10 \\cdot 2 = 20 \\quad \\text{(cost of gummy bears)}\n\\]\n\\[\n20 \\cdot 5 = 100 \\quad \\text{(cost of chocolate chips)}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these values back into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n10x + 20 + 100 = 150\n\\]\n\nCombine the constant terms on the left side:\n\n\\[\n10x + 120 = 150\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( 10x \\), subtract 120 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n10x = 30\n\\]\n\nFinally, solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 10:\n\n\\[\nx = 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost of one chocolate bar is \\(\\boxed{3}\\) dollars."
