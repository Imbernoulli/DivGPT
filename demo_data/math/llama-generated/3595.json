Calculate the total weight of apples consumed by Irene and her dog each day.\n2. Determine the total weight of apples consumed in 2 weeks.\n3. Calculate the cost of the apples.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of apples consumed by Irene and her dog each day. Since Irene shares half of a small apple with her dog every day, and each small apple weighs 1/4 of a pound, the total weight of apples consumed each day is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\text{ pound} \\times \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ pound} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ pound}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total weight of apples consumed in 2 weeks. Since there are 14 days in 2 weeks, the total weight of apples consumed in 2 weeks is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\text{ pound/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = \\frac{14}{4} \\text{ pounds} = 3.5 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the cost of the apples. Since apples cost $2.00 per pound, the total cost for 3.5 pounds of apples is:\n\\[\n3.5 \\text{ pounds} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/pound} = 7 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Irene will spend \\boxed{7} dollars so that she and her dog have enough apples to last for 2 weeks.",

        "To determine how much Irene will spend on apples for herself and her dog for 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of apples consumed by Irene and her dog each day.\n2. Determine the total weight of apples consumed in 2 weeks.\n3. Calculate the cost of the apples based on the price per pound.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of apples consumed by Irene and her dog each day. Since Irene shares half of a small apple with her dog each day and a small apple weighs about 1/4 of a pound, the total weight of apples consumed each day is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total weight of apples consumed in 2 weeks. Since there are 14 days in 2 weeks, the total weight of apples consumed in 2 weeks is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 14 = \\frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the cost of the apples based on the price per pound. Since the apples cost $2.00 per pound, the total cost for 3.5 pounds of apples is:\n\\[\n3.5 \\times 2 = 7 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Irene will spend so that she and her dog have enough apples to last for 2 weeks is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",
