        "To determine how many pages Nico read on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of pages read over the three days:**\n   Nico read a total of 51 pages from Monday to Wednesday.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of pages read on Monday and Tuesday:**\n   - On Monday, Nico read the first book with 20 pages.\n   - On Tuesday, Nico read the second book with 12 pages.\n\n   Adding these together:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ pages (Monday)} + 12 \\text{ pages (Tuesday)} = 32 \\text{ pages}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of pages read on Wednesday:**\n   Since the total number of pages read over the three days is 51 pages, and we have already calculated that he read 32 pages on Monday and Tuesday, we subtract the pages read on those days from the total:\n   \\[\n   51 \\text{ pages (total)} - 32 \\text{ pages (Monday and Tuesday)} = 19 \\text{ pages (Wednesday)}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of pages Nico read on Wednesday is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).",
