        "To determine how many dollars remain in Emma's bank account after she withdraws as many $5 bills as she can, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount Emma spends in a week.\n2. Determine how much money remains in the account after her spending.\n3. Calculate how many $5 bills Emma can withdraw from the remaining money.\n4. Determine how much money remains in the account after the withdrawal.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount Emma spends in a week. Since she spends $8 each day and there are 7 days in a week, we have:\n\\[\n8 \\times 7 = 56\n\\]\nSo, Emma spends $56 in a week.\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount in the account to find out how much money remains:\n\\[\n100 - 56 = 44\n\\]\nSo, Emma has $44 left in her account after spending $56.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many $5 bills Emma can withdraw from the $44. We do this by dividing $44 by $5 and taking the integer part of the quotient:\n\\[\n44 \\div 5 = 8.8\n\\]\nThe integer part of 8.8 is 8, so Emma can withdraw 8 $5 bills. The total value of these $5 bills is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 5 = 40\n\\]\nSo, Emma withdraws $40 from her account.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total value of the $5 bills withdrawn from the remaining money to find out how much money remains in the account:\n\\[\n44 - 40 = 4\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of dollars remaining in the account is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
