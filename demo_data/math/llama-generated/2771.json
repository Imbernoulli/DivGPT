Determine the total number of flowers given away.\n3. Subtract the total number of flowers given away from the original number of flowers to find out how many flowers Lara put in the vase.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of flowers Lara gave to her grandma. She gave 6 more flowers to her grandma than she gave to her mom. Since she gave 15 flowers to her mom, the number of flowers she gave to her grandma is:\n\\[ 15 + 6 = 21 \\]\n\nNext, let's find the total number of flowers given away. This is the sum of the flowers given to her mom and the flowers given to her grandma:\n\\[ 15 + 21 = 36 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of flowers given away from the original number of flowers to find out how many flowers Lara put in the vase:\n\\[ 52 - 36 = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of stems of flowers Lara put in the vase is:\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]",
