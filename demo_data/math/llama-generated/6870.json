        "To determine how many miles Harriet ran, we start by finding out how many miles the other three runners (Tomas, Tyler, and Harriet) ran combined. Since the total distance run by all four runners is 195 miles and Katarina ran 51 miles, we subtract Katarina's distance from the total distance:\n\n\\[ 195 - 51 = 144 \\]\n\nThis means that Tomas, Tyler, and Harriet ran a combined total of 144 miles.
