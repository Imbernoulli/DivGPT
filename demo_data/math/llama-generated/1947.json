        "To determine the total number of koi fish in the tank after three weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Count of Fish:**\n   - The total number of fish in the tank initially is 280.\n   - Let \\( k \\) represent the initial number of koi fish.\n   - Let \\( g \\) represent the initial number of goldfish.\n   - We know that \\( k + g = 280 \\).\n\n2. **Fish Added Over Three Weeks:**\n   - The school adds 2 koi fish and 5 goldfish per day.\n   - Over three weeks (3 weeks × 7 days/week = 21 days), the total number of koi fish added is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ koi fish/day} \\times 21 \\text{ days} = 42 \\text{ koi fish}\n     \\]\n   - Over three weeks, the total number of goldfish added is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ goldfish/day} \\times 21 \\text{ days} = 105 \\text{ goldfish}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Count of Goldfish:**\n   - The tank had 200 goldfish at the end of the three weeks.\n   - The initial number of goldfish \\( g \\) plus the goldfish added over three weeks equals the final number of goldfish:\n     \\[\n     g + 105 = 200\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( g \\):\n     \\[\n     g = 200 - 105 = 95\n     \\]\n\n4. **Initial Count of Koi Fish:**\n   - Using the initial total number of fish:\n     \\[\n     k + g = 280\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( g = 95 \\):\n     \\[\n     k + 95 = 280\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( k \\):\n     \\[\n     k = 280 - 95 = 185\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Count of Koi Fish:**\n   - The final number of koi fish is the initial number of koi fish plus the koi fish added over three weeks:\n     \\[\n     k + 42 = 185 + 42 = 227\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of koi fish in the tank after the three weeks is \\(\\boxed{227}\\).",
        "Let's start by determining the initial number of goldfish and koi fish in the tank. Let \\( g \\) be the initial number of goldfish and \\( k \\) be the initial number of koi fish. We know that the total number of fish in the tank is 280, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ g + k = 280 \\]\n\nWe are also given that at the end of the three weeks, the tank had 200 goldfish. Over the three weeks, the school added 5 goldfish per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, over three weeks the school added:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 7 \\times 3 = 105 \\text{ goldfish} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of goldfish at the end of the three weeks is the initial number of goldfish plus the goldfish added over the three weeks:\n\n\\[ g + 105 = 200 \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( g \\) by subtracting 105 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ g = 200 - 105 = 95 \\]\n\nSo, the initial number of goldfish is 95. Using the equation \\( g + k = 280 \\), we can substitute \\( g = 95 \\) to find \\( k \\):\n\n\\[ 95 + k = 280 \\]\n\nSubtracting 95 from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ k = 280 - 95 = 185 \\]\n\nSo, the initial number of koi fish is 185. Over the three weeks, the school added 2 koi fish per day. Therefore, the total number of koi fish added over the three weeks is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 7 \\times 3 = 42 \\]\n\nThe total number of koi fish in the tank after the three weeks is the initial number of koi fish plus the koi fish added over the three weeks:\n\n\\[ 185 + 42 = 227 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of koi fish in the tank after the three weeks is \\(\\boxed{227}\\).",
        "Let's start by defining the initial number of koi fish and goldfish in the tank. Let \\( k \\) be the initial number of koi fish and \\( g \\) be the initial number of goldfish. According to the problem, the total number of fish in the tank initially is 280, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ k + g = 280. \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many goldfish and koi fish were added over the three weeks. Since there are 3 weeks and each week has 7 days, the total number of days over the three weeks is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 7 = 21. \\]\n\nThe school added 2 koi fish and 5 goldfish per day. Therefore, the total number of koi fish added over the three weeks is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 21 = 42, \\]\nand the total number of goldfish added over the three weeks is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 21 = 105. \\]\n\nLet's denote the number of goldfish in the tank at the end of the three weeks as \\( g_{\\text{final}} \\). According to the problem, \\( g_{\\text{final}} = 200 \\). The number of goldfish at the end of the three weeks can also be expressed as the initial number of goldfish plus the total number of goldfish added:\n\\[ g_{\\text{final}} = g + 105. \\]\nSince \\( g_{\\text{final}} = 200 \\), we can substitute and solve for \\( g \\):\n\\[ 200 = g + 105. \\]\nSubtracting 105 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ g = 200 - 105 = 95. \\]\nSo, the initial number of goldfish is 95. Using the initial equation \\( k + g = 280 \\), we can now find the initial number of koi fish \\( k \\):\n\\[ k + 95 = 280. \\]\nSubtracting 95 from both sides, we get:\n\\[ k = 280 - 95 = 185. \\]\nThe initial number of koi fish is 185. After the three weeks, the total number of koi fish in the tank is the initial number of koi fish plus the total number of koi fish added:\n\\[ k_{\\text{final}} = 185 + 42 = 227. \\]\nTherefore, the total number of koi fish in the tank after the three weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{227}. \\]",
