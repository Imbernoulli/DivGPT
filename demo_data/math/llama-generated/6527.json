        "To determine how many seashells Ali has left, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of seashells.\n2. Subtract the seashells given to his friends.\n3. Subtract the seashells given to his brothers.\n4. Calculate half of the remaining seashells after the subtractions.\n5. Subtract half of the remaining seashells from the remaining total.\n\nLet's go through the steps in detail:\n\n1. Ali starts with 180 seashells.\n2. He gives away 40 seashells to his friends:\n   \\[\n   180 - 40 = 140\n   \\]\n   So, he has 140 seashells left.\n3. He gives away 30 seashells to his brothers:\n   \\[\n   140 - 30 = 110\n   \\]\n   So, he has 110 seashells left.\n4. He sells half of the remaining seashells:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{110}{2} = 55\n   \\]\n   So, he sells 55 seashells.\n5. Subtract the number of seashells sold from the remaining total:\n   \\[\n   110 - 55 = 55\n   \\]\n   So, he has 55 seashells left.\n\nTherefore, the number of seashells Ali has left is \\boxed{55}.",
