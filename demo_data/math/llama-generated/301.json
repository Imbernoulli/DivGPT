        "To determine the total cost of 3 bottles of gummy vitamins, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discount on each bottle.\n2. Determine the price of each bottle after the discount.\n3. Calculate the total cost of 3 bottles after the discount.\n4. Subtract the value of the coupons from the total cost.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discount on each bottle.**\n\nThe original price of each bottle is $15.00, and there is a 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 20% (or 0.20):\n\n\\[ 15.00 \\times 0.20 = 3.00 \\]\n\nSo, the discount on each bottle is $3.00.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the price of each bottle after the discount.**\n\nSubtract the discount from the original price:\n\n\\[ 15.00 - 3.00 = 12.00 \\]\n\nSo, the price of each bottle after the discount is $12.00.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of 3 bottles after the discount.**\n\nMultiply the price of one bottle after the discount by 3:\n\n\\[ 12.00 \\times 3 = 36.00 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost of 3 bottles after the discount is $36.00.\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the value of the coupons from the total cost.**\n\nKen has 3 coupons, each worth $2.00. To find the total value of the coupons, we multiply the value of one coupon by 3:\n\n\\[ 2.00 \\times 3 = 6.00 \\]\n\nSo, the total value of the coupons is $6.00. Subtract this from the total cost of the bottles:\n\n\\[ 36.00 - 6.00 = 30.00 \\]\n\nSo, the final total cost for 3 bottles is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

Determine the price of each bottle after the discount.\n3. Calculate the total cost of 3 bottles before applying the coupons.\n4. Subtract the value of the coupons from the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discount on each bottle. The original price is $15.00, and the discount is 20%. So, the discount amount per bottle is:\n\\[ 15.00 \\times 0.20 = 3.00 \\]\nThis means the price of each bottle after the discount is:\n\\[ 15.00 - 3.00 = 12.00 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of 3 bottles before applying the coupons:\n\\[ 12.00 \\times 3 = 36.00 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the value of the coupons. Ken has 3 coupons, each worth $2.00, so the total value of the coupons is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 2.00 = 6.00 \\]\nSubtracting the value of the coupons from the total cost gives:\n\\[ 36.00 - 6.00 = 30.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost for 3 bottles of gummy vitamins is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30.00} \\]",
