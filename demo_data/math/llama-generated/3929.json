        "To determine the total number of cars that travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday, we need to calculate the number of cars for each day and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Monday**: The number of cars on Monday is 20% less than on Tuesday. Since there are 25 cars on Tuesday, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   25 - (0.20 \\times 25) = 25 - 5 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, there are 20 cars on Monday.\n\n2. **Wednesday**: The number of cars on Wednesday is 2 more than on Monday. Since there are 20 cars on Monday, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   20 + 2 = 22\n   \\]\n   So, there are 22 cars on Wednesday.\n\n3. **Thursday**: The number of cars on Thursday is 10. So, there are 10 cars on Thursday.\n\n4. **Friday**: The number of cars on Friday is 10. So, there are 10 cars on Friday.\n\n5. **Saturday**: The number of cars on Saturday is 5.
