        "To determine how much free time Jackie has in a day, we need to calculate the total time she spends on working, exercising, and sleeping, and then subtract this total from the total number of hours in a day.\n\nFirst, let's add up the time Jackie spends on these activities:\n-Jackie spends 8 hours working.\n-Jackie spends 3 hours exercising.\n-Jackie spends 8 hours sleeping.\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ hours} + 3 \\text{ hours} + 8 \\text{ hours} = 19 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total time spent on these activities from the total number of hours in a day. There are 24 hours in a day, so:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ hours} - 19 \\text{ hours} = 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jackie has \\(\\boxed{5}\\) hours of free time per day.",
