        "To determine the total number of keys missing from James' keyboard, we need to consider both the consonants and the vowels separately.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of consonants missing. There are 21 consonants in the alphabet, and 1/7 of them are missing. So, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{7} \\times 21 = 3\n\\]\nThis means 3 consonants are missing.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of vowels missing. There are 5 vowels in the alphabet, and 2 of them are missing. So, we have:\n\\[\n2\n\\]\nThis means 2 vowels are missing.\n\nTo find the total number of keys missing, we add the number of missing consonants and the number of missing vowels:\n\\[\n3 + 2 = 5\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of keys missing from James' keyboard is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",

There are 21 consonants in the alphabet, and James' keyboard is missing \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) of them. So, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Missing consonants} = \\frac{1}{7} \\times 21 = 3\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of missing vowels. There are 5 vowels in the alphabet, and James' keyboard is missing 2 of them. So, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Missing vowels} = 2\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of missing consonants and the number of missing vowels to find the total number of missing keys:\n\\[\n\\text{Total missing keys} = \\text{Missing consonants} + \\text{Missing vowels} = 3 + 2 = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of keys missing from James' keyboard is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of keys missing from James' keyboard, we need to calculate the number of missing consonants and vowels separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of missing consonants.

Therefore, the number of missing consonants is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{7} \\times 21 = 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of missing vowels. There are 5 vowels in the alphabet, and James' keyboard is missing 2 of them. Therefore, the number of missing vowels is:\n\\[\n2\n\\]\n\nTo find the total number of keys missing, we add the number of missing consonants and the number of missing vowels:\n\\[\n3 + 2 = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of keys missing from James' keyboard is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
