Therefore, the number of cars in each lane is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 240 = 480\n   \\]\n\n3. Since there are 4 lanes, the total number of cars is:\n   \\[\n   480 \\times 4 = 1920\n   \\]\n\n4. The total number of vehicles is the sum of the total number of trucks and the total number of cars:\n   \\[\n   240 + 1920 = 2160\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of vehicles in all the lanes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2160}\n\\]",
