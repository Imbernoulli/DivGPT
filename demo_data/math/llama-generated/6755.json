        "To determine the number of students in class C, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students in class A.\n2. Use the information about class B to find the number of students in class B.\n3. Subtract the number of students in classes A and B from the total number of students to find the number of students in class C.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students in class A:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students in class A} = 40\\% \\text{ of } 80 = 0.40 \\times 80 = 32\n   \\]\n\n2.

Subtract the number of students in classes A and B from the total number of students to find the number of students in class C:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students in class C} = 80 - \\text{Number of students in class A} - \\text{Number of students in class B} = 80 - 32 - 11 = 37\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students in class C is \\(\\boxed{37}\\).",

We know that 40% of the students are in class A, and the total number of students is 80. Therefore, the number of students in class A is:\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 80 = 32\n\\]\nSo, there are 32 students in class A.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of students in class B.

Since the total number of students is 80, we can find the number of students in class A by multiplying 80 by 40% (or 0.40):\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students in class A} = 80 \\times 0.40 = 32\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of students in class B. We know that class B has 21 students fewer than class A. Therefore, we subtract 21 from the number of students in class A:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students in class B} = 32 - 21 = 11\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the number of students in class C by subtracting the number of students in classes A and B from the total number of students:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students in class C} = 80 - 32 - 11 = 37\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students in class C is \\boxed{37}.",
