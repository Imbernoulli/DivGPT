        "To determine the age of the fifth scroll, we need to follow the given pattern in the ages of the scrolls. Let's denote the age of the \\( n \\)-th scroll as \\( S_n \\). We know that the first scroll is 4080 years old, so \\( S_1 = 4080 \\). Each subsequent scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll's age.

        "To determine the age of the fifth scroll, we need to calculate the age of each scroll step by step, starting from the first scroll. Let's denote the age of the first scroll as \\( S_1 \\), the age of the second scroll as \\( S_2 \\), and so on up to the fifth scroll as \\( S_5 \\).\n\nGiven:\n\\[ S_1 = 4080 \\]\n\nEach scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll's age. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:\n\\[ S_{n+1} = S_n + \\frac{S_n}{2} = S_n \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = S_n \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nUsing this formula, we can find the age of each subsequent scroll.\n\n1. **Age of the second scroll (\\( S_2 \\)):**\n   \\[ S_2 = S_1 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 4080 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 6120 \\]\n\n2. **Age of the third scroll (\\( S_3 \\)):**\n   \\[ S_3 = S_2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 6120 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 9180 \\]\n\n3. **Age of the fourth scroll (\\( S_4 \\)):**\n   \\[ S_4 = S_3 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 9180 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 13770 \\]\n\n4. **Age of the fifth scroll (\\( S_5 \\)):**\n   \\[ S_5 = S_4 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 13770 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 20655 \\]\n\nTherefore, the age of the fifth scroll is \\(\\boxed{20655}\\).",
