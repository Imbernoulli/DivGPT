        "To determine Sam's weight, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Peter's weight and use it to find Tyler's weight.\n2. Use Tyler's weight to find Sam's weight.\n\nFirst, we know that Peter weighs 65 pounds. According to the problem, Peter weighs half as much as Tyler. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Tyler's weight:\n\\[ \\text{Peter's weight} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Tyler's weight} \\]\n\\[ 65 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Tyler's weight} \\]\nTo find Tyler's weight, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ \\text{Tyler's weight} = 65 \\times 2 = 130 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Tyler weighs 25 pounds more than Sam. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Sam's weight:\n\\[ \\text{Tyler's weight} = \\text{Sam's weight} + 25 \\]\n\\[ 130 = \\text{Sam's weight} + 25 \\]\nTo find Sam's weight, we subtract 25 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ \\text{Sam's weight} = 130 - 25 = 105 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThus, Sam weighs \\(\\boxed{105}\\) pounds.",
