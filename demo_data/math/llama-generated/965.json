        "To determine the total number of chairs taken to the hall, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of students involved:**\n   - Kingsley is find four friends to help her.\n   - Including Kingsley herself, the total number of students is:\n     \\[\n     1 + 4 = 5\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of chairs each student carries per trip:**\n   - Each student carries 5 chairs per trip.\n\n3. **Determine the number of trips each student makes:**\n   - Each student makes 10 trips.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of chairs each student carries:**\n   - Each student carries 5 chairs per trip and makes 10 trips, so the total number of chairs each student carries is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ chairs/trip} \\times 10 \\text{ trips} = 50 \\text{ chairs}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of chairs carried by all students:**\n   - There are 5 students, and each student carries 50 chairs, so the total number of chairs carried by all students is:\n     \\[\n     50 \\text{ chairs/student} \\times 5 \\text{ students} = 250 \\text{ chairs}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of chairs taken to the hall is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of chairs taken to the hall, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students carrying chairs.\n2. Determine the total number of chairs carried by each student.\n3. Multiply the total number of chairs carried by each student by the total number of students.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of students carrying chairs. Kingsley ismatch with four friends, so there are \\(1 + 4 = 5\\) students in total.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of chairs carried by each student. Each student carries 5 chairs per trip and makes 10 trips. Therefore, the total number of chairs carried by each student is \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\nNow, we multiply the total number of chairs carried by each student by the total number of students to find the total number of chairs taken to the hall. This is \\(50 \\times 5 = 250\\).\n\nSo, the total number of chairs taken to the hall is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",

Kingsley and her four friends make a total of:\n\\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \\text{ students} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of chairs each student carried in one trip. Each student carried:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ chairs per trip} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the number of chairs each student carried in all trips. Each student made 10 trips, so the total number of chairs each student carried is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ chairs per trip} \\times 10 \\text{ trips} = 50 \\text{ chairs} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of chairs carried by all students. Since there are 5 students and each carried 50 chairs, the total number of chairs carried is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ students} \\times 50 \\text{ chairs per student} = 250 \\text{ chairs} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of chairs taken to the hall is:\n\\[ \\boxed{250} \\]",
