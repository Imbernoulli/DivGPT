        "To determine the number of pumpkins at Sunshine Orchard, we start by identifying the number of pumpkins at Moonglow Orchard. According to the problem, Moonglow Orchard has 14 pumpkins. Let's denote the number of pumpkins at Moonglow Orchard as \\( M \\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ M = 14 \\]\n\nNext, we know that the number of pumpkins at Sunshine Orchard is 12 more than three times the number of pumpkins at Moonglow Orchard. Let's denote the number of pumpkins at Sunshine Orchard as \\( S \\). The relationship between the number of pumpkins at Sunshine Orchard and Moonglow Orchard can be expressed by the equation:\n\n\\[ S = 3M + 12 \\]\n\nNow, we substitute the value of \\( M \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ S = 3(14) + 12 \\]\n\nWe perform the multiplication first:\n\n\\[ S = 42 + 12 \\]\n\nThen, we add the numbers together:\n\n\\[ S = 54 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pumpkins at Sunshine Orchard is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
