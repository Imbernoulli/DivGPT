        "To determine how many minutes it will take Yolanda's husband to catch her, we start by calculating how far Yolanda has traveled by the time her husband begins driving. Yolanda leaves at 7:00 AM and rides her bike at 20 miles per hour. Her husband leaves 15 minutes later, which is at 7:15 AM. Since 15 minutes is equivalent to \\(\\frac{15}{60} = \\frac{1}{4}\\) hours, we can calculate the distance Yolanda has traveled in that time as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 20 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ hours} = 5 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nSo, when her husband starts driving, Yolanda is 5 miles ahead. Next, we need to find out how long it will take her husband to cover that 5-mile gap. Let \\( t \\) be the time in hours it takes her husband to catch up to Yolanda. In that time, her husband will have driven \\( 40t \\) miles, and Yolanda will have biked an additional \\( 20t \\) miles. Since her husband starts 5 miles behind, the equation representing the distances traveled is:\n\n\\[\n40t = 5 + 20t\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( t \\), we first subtract \\( 20t \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n40t - 20t = 5\n\\]\n\\[\n20t = 5\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 20:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( t \\) is in hours, we convert it to minutes by multiplying by 60:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 60 = 15 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take her husband \\(\\boxed{15}\\) minutes to catch up to Yolanda.",
