        "To determine how many 2-foot sections Bob gets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the length of rope Bob uses to make the small piece of art.\n2. Determine how much rope is left after making the small piece of art.\n3. Calculate how much rope Bob gives to his friend.\n4. Determine how much rope is left after giving half to his friend.\n5. Calculate the number of 2-foot sections Bob can cut from the remaining rope.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Bob buys 50 feet of rope and uses \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of it to make a small piece of art. So, the length of rope used is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times 50 = 10 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\nAfter using 10 feet, the remaining length of rope is:\n\\[\n50 - 10 = 40 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\nNext, Bob gives half of the remaining rope to his friend. So, the length of rope given to his friend is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 = 20 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\nAfter giving 20 feet to his friend, the remaining length of rope is:\n\\[\n40 - 20 = 20 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\nFinally, Bob cuts the remaining rope into 2-foot sections. The number of sections he gets is:\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{2} = 10\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of sections Bob gets is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",

Determine how many 2-foot sections can be cut from the remaining 20 feet of rope.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n   \\]\n   So, Bob can cut 10 sections.\n\nTherefore, the number of sections Bob gets is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "To determine how many 2-foot sections Bob gets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the length of rope used for the art:**\n   Bob uses \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the 50 feet of rope.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times 50 = 10 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the length of rope remaining:**\n   Subtract the length used for the art from the total length of rope.\n   \\[\n   50 - 10 = 40 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the length of rope given to the friend:**\n   Bob gives half of the remaining rope to his friend.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 = 20 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the length of rope left with Bob:**\n   Subtract the length given to the friend from the remaining rope.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of 2-foot sections Bob gets:**\n   Divide the length of rope left with Bob by the length of each section.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of 2-foot sections Bob gets is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
