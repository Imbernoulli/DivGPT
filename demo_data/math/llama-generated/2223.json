        "To determine the total number of hours Max watches the show during the week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of days Max watches the show.\n2. Calculate the duration of each episode.\n3. Multiply the number of days by the duration of each episode.\n\nFirst, we know that the show airs from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm, which is a duration of 30 minutes. Since the show only airs on weekdays and Max misses the Friday episode, he watches the show on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Therefore, he watches the show for 4 days.\n\nNext, we convert the duration of each episode from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is equal to:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{30}{60} \\text{ hours} = 0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we multiply the number of days Max watches the show by the duration of each episode:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ days} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours/day} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Max watches the show is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
        "To determine how many hours of the show Max watched, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of episodes Max watches in a week.\n2. Calculate the total time spent watching the show for the episodes he watches.\n\nFirst, let's identify the number of episodes Max watches in a week. The show airs from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week. However, Max misses the Friday episode, so he watches the show on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. This means he watches 4 episodes in a week.\n\nNext, we calculate the total time spent watching the show. Each episode is 30 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent watching 4 episodes is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ episodes} \\times 30 \\text{ minutes/episode} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 120 minutes to hours:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of hours of the show that Max watched is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",

Determine the number of episodes Max watched in a week.\n3. Calculate the total time watched.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the duration of each episode.**\n\nThe show airs from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm, so each episode is:\n\\[ 2:30 \\text{ pm} - 2:00 \\text{ pm} = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of episodes Max watched in a week.**\n\nThe show airs on weekdays (Monday through Friday), so there are 5 episodes in a week. Since Max misses the Friday episode, he watches:\n\\[ 5 - 1 = 4 \\text{ episodes} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total time watched.**\n\nEach episode is 30 minutes, and Max watches 4 episodes, so the total time watched is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ episodes} \\times 30 \\text{ minutes/episode} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nConvert minutes to hours:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours of the show that Max watched is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
        "To determine how many hours of the show Max watched in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the duration of each episode.\n2. Determine the number of episodes Max watches in a week.\n3. Calculate the total time watched.\n\nFirst, let's find the duration of each episode. The show airs from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm, so the duration is:\n\\[ 2:30 \\text{ pm} - 2:00 \\text{ pm} = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of episodes Max watches in a week. The show airs on weekdays (Monday through Friday), so there are 5 episodes in a full week. However, Max misses the Friday episode, so he watches:\n\\[ 5 - 1 = 4 \\text{ episodes} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total time Max watched. Since each episode is 30 minutes and he watches 4 episodes, the total time is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 30 \\text{ minutes} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTo convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\\[ 120 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Max watched the show is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",

Therefore, the number of episodes he watched is:\n\\[ 4 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total hours watched.**\n\nTo find the total hours watched, we multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode. Since 30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours, we have:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ episodes} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours/episode} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours of the show that Max watched is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
        "To determine how many hours of the show Max watched, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. The show airs from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm, so each episode is 30 minutes long.\n2. The show only airs during weekdays, which are Monday through Friday. Therefore, there are 5 episodes in a typical week.\n3. Max misses the Friday episode, so he watches 4 episodes.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total time for the 4 episodes:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ episodes} \\times 30 \\text{ minutes per episode} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Max watched the show is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
        "To determine how many hours of the show Max watched in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the duration of each episode:**\n   - The show airs from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm.\n   - The duration of each episode is \\(2:30 \\text{ pm} - 2:00 \\text{ pm} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\n2. **Convert the duration to hours:**\n   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 30 minutes to hours:\n     \\[\n     30 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{30}{60} \\text{ hours} = 0.5 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of episodes Max watches in a week:**\n   - The show airs on weekdays (Monday to Friday), so there are 5 episodes in a week.\n   - Max misses the Friday episode, so he watches \\(5 - 1 = 4\\) episodes.\n\n4. **Calculate the total hours watched:**\n   - Since each episode is 0.5 hours, and Max watches 4 episodes, the total hours watched is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ episodes} \\times 0.5 \\text{ hours/episode} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Max watched the show is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."
