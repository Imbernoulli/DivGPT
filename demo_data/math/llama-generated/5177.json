        "To determine how much Lance makes on each workday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of hours Lance works each day.\n2. Determine Lance's daily earnings based on his hourly wage.\n\nFirst, we find out how many hours Lance works each day. Since he works 35 hours a week spread equally over 5 workdays, we divide the total weekly hours by the number of workdays:\n\\[\n\\text{Hours per day} = \\frac{35 \\text{ hours}}{5 \\text{ days}} = 7 \\text{ hours per day}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate Lance's daily earnings. Since he earns $9 per hour, we multiply the number of hours he works each day by his hourly wage:\n\\[\n\\text{Daily earnings} = 7 \\text{ hours per day} \\times 9 \\text{ dollars per hour} = 63 \\text{ dollars per day}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Lance makes \\(\\boxed{63}\\) dollars on each workday.",
        "To determine how much Lance makes on each workday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Lance's total weekly earnings:**\n   Lance earns $9 per hour and works 35 hours a week.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weekly earnings} = \\text{Hourly wage} \\times \\text{Total hours worked} = 9 \\times 35\n   \\]\n\n   Let's perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 35 = 9 \\times (30 + 5) = (9 \\times 30) + (9 \\times 5)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 30 = 270\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 5 = 45\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   270 + 45 = 315\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, Lance's total weekly earnings are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weekly earnings} = 315 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Lance's earnings per workday:**\n   Lance works 5 switch days in a week.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings per workday} = \\frac{\\text{Total weekly earnings}}{\\text{Number of workdays}} = \\frac{315}{5}\n   \\]\n\n   Let's perform the division:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{315}{5} = 63\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, Lance makes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings per workday} = 63 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Lance makes \\(\\boxed{63}\\) dollars on each workday.",
