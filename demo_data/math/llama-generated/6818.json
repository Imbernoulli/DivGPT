After starting this morning, he manages an average speed over flat ground of about 20 miles per hour. Four and a half hours later, the road started to incline upwards enough that he could only manage 12 miles per hour. Two and a half hours later, though, the road declined downhill and was able to mostly coast at 24 miles per hour. Unfortunately, he only got to enjoy this for one and a half hours before he punctured a tire. He had forgotten to pack a repair kit, so he had to walk his bike the rest of the way to the next town. If the next town was 164 miles from where he started this morning, how far did Alex have to walk?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how far Alex had to walk, we need to calculate the distance he covered by biking and then subtract that from the total distance to the next town.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Alex covered on flat ground. He biked for 4.5 hours at an average speed of 20 miles per hour:\n\\[\n4.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 20 \\text{ miles per hour} = 90 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance he covered on the uphill section. He biked for 2.5 hours at an average speed of 12 miles per hour:\n\\[\n2.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 12 \\text{ miles per hour} = 30 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the distance he covered on the downhill section.
