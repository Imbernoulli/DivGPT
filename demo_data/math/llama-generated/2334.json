Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4:\n\n- Fiona's monthly earnings:\n  \\[\n  \\$800/\\text{week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = \\$3200/\\text{month}\n  \\]\n\n- John's monthly earnings:\n  \\[\n  \\$600/\\text{week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = \\$2400/\\text{month}\n  \\]\n\n- Jeremy's monthly earnings:\n  \\[\n  \\$500/\\text{week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = \\$2000/\\text{month}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the monthly earnings of all three employees to find the total monthly expenditure for the boss:\n\n\\[\n\\$3200 + \\$2400 + \\$2000 = \\$7600\n\\]\n\nThus, the boss spends \\(\\boxed{7600}\\) dollars paying all of them every month.",

At a rate of $20 per hour, her weekly earnings are:\n  \\[\n  40 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 20 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 800 \\text{ dollars/week}\n  \\]\n\n- John works 30 hours a week. At a rate of $20 per hour, his weekly earnings are:\n  \\[\n  30 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 20 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 600 \\text{ dollars/week}\n  \\]\n\n- Jeremy works 25 hours a week. At a rate of $20 per hour, his weekly earnings are:\n  \\[\n  25 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 20 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 500 \\text{ dollars/week}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's determine the monthly earnings for each employee by assuming there are 4 weeks in a month:\n\n- Fiona's monthly earnings are:\n  \\[\n  800 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 3200 \\text{ dollars/month}\n  \\]\n\n- John's monthly earnings are:\n  \\[\n  600 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 2400 \\text{ dollars/month}\n  \\]\n\n- Jeremy's monthly earnings are:\n  \\[\n  500 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 2000 \\text{ dollars/month}\n  \\]\n\nFinally, let's sum the monthly earnings of all three employees to find the total monthly liar for the boss:\n\n\\[\n3200 \\text{ dollars/month} + 2400 \\text{ dollars/month} + 2000 \\text{ dollars/month} = 7600 \\text{ dollars/month}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the boss spends \\(\\boxed{7600}\\) dollars paying all of them every month.",
