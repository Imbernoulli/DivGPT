        "To determine how much water John saved in June, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the daily water usage with the old toilet:**\n   - The old toilet uses 5 gallons of water per flush.\n   - The household flushes 15 times per day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily water usage with old toilet} = 5 \\text{ gallons/ flush} \\times 15 \\text{ flushes/day} = 75 \\text{ gallons/day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the water usage per flush with the new toilet:**\n   - The new toilet uses 80% less water per flush than the old toilet.\n   - First, calculate 80% of 5 gallons:\n   \\[\n   80\\% \\text{ of 5 gallons} = 0.80 \\times 5 = 4 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   - Subtract this amount from the original usage to find the new usage:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Water usage per flush with new toilet} = 5 \\text{ gallons} - 4 \\text{ gallons} = 1 \\text{ gallon/ flush}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the daily water usage with the new toilet:**\n   - The new toilet uses 1 gallon of water per flush.\n   - The household flushes 15 times per day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily water usage with new toilet} = 1 \\text{ gallon/ flush} \\times 15 \\text{ flushes/day} = 15 \\text{ gallons/day}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the daily water savings:**\n   - Subtract the daily water usage with the new toilet from the daily water usage with the old toilet:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily water savings} = 75 \\text{ gallons/day} - 15 \\text{ gallons/day} = 60 \\text{ gallons/day}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total water savings for June:**\n   - June has 30 days.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total water savings for June} = 60 \\text{ gallons/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 1800 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of water John saved in June is \\(\\boxed{1800}\\) gallons.",

Since John flushes 15 times per day, the total amount of water used per day with the new toilet is:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ gallon/flush} \\times 15 \\text{ flushes/day} = 15 \\text{ gallons/day}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the daily water savings.**\n\nThe daily water savings is the difference between the amount of water used with the old toilet and the amount of water used with the new toilet:\n\\[\n75 \\text{ gallons/day} - 15 \\text{ gallons/day} = 60 \\text{ gallons/day}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total water savings for the month of June.**\n\nJune has 30 days. Therefore, the total water savings for June is:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ gallons/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 1800 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nSo, the total amount of water John saved in June is \\boxed{1800}.",
