        "To determine the cost of each pair of blue socks, we start by calculating the total cost of the red socks. Luis bought 4 pairs of red socks, and each pair costs $3. Therefore, the total cost of the red socks is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{ pairs} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars per pair} = 12 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost of the red socks from the total amount Luis spent to find out how much he spent on the blue socks.

        "To determine the cost of each pair of blue socks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the red socks.\n2.

Divide the total cost of the blue socks by the number of pairs of blue socks to find the cost per pair.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1.
