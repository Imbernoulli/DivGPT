        "To determine how many books Sarah should check out, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of words Sarah can read in 20 hours.\n2. Calculate the total number of words in one book.\n3. Determine how many books she can read with the total number of words she can read in 20 hours.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of words Sarah can read in 20 hours. Since she reads 40 words per minute, we need to find out how many minutes are in 20 hours:\n\n\\[ 20 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 1200 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of words she can read in 1200 minutes:\n\n\\[ 1200 \\text{ minutes} \\times 40 \\text{ words/minute} = 48000 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of words in one book. Each book has 100 words per page and 80 pages:\n\n\\[ 100 \\text{ words/page} \\times 80 \\text{ pages} = 8000 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many books she can read with 48000 words:\n\n\\[ \\frac{48000 \\text{ words}}{8000 \\text{ words/book}} = 6 \\text{ books} \\]\n\nTherefore, Sarah should check out \\(\\boxed{6}\\) books.",

Each book has 100 words per page and is 80 pages long, so the total number of words in one book is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ words/page} \\times 80 \\text{ pages} = 8000 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many books she can read with the total number of words she can read in 20 hours. We do this by dividing the total number of words she can read by the total number of words in one book:\n\\[ \\frac{48000 \\text{ words}}{8000 \\text{ words/book}} = 6 \\text{ books} \\]\n\nTherefore, Sarah should check out \\(\\boxed{6}\\) books.",
