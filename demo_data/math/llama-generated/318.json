        "To find the total amount of money collected at Lulu's party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of girls at the party.\n2. Calculate the amount of money each girl paid.\n3. Compute the total amount of money paid by the boys.\n4. Compute the total amount of money paid by the girls.\n5. Add the amounts paid by the boys and the girls to get the total amount collected.\n\nFirst, we know there are 40 boys at the party. According to the problem, there are four times as many boys as girls. Let's denote the number of girls by \\( g \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 40 = 4g \\]\nSolving for \\( g \\), we get:\n\\[ g = \\frac{40}{4} = 10 \\]\nSo, there are 10 girls at the party.\n\nNext, we know each boy paid $50 to attend the party. Since each boy paid twice the money that each girl paid, each girl paid:\n\\[ \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total amount of money paid by the boys. Since there are 40 boys and each boy paid $50, the total amount paid by the boys is:\n\\[ 40 \\times 50 = 2000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of money paid by the girls. Since there are 10 girls and each girl paid $25, the total amount paid by the girls is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 25 = 250 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the amounts paid by the boys and the girls to get the total amount collected at the party:\n\\[ 2000 + 250 = 2250 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money collected at the party is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2250} \\]",

Add the amounts paid by the boys and the girls to find the total amount collected.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of girls at the party:**\n   We know that there are four times as many boys as girls.
