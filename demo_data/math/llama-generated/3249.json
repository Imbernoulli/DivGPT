        "To determine the total age of the three brands of wine, we need to find the age of each brand based on the given relationships and then sum these ages.\n\n1. We know that the Carlo Rosi is 40 years old.\n2. The Franzia wine is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi. Therefore, we can calculate the age of the Franzia wine as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Age of Franzia} = 3 \\times \\text{Age of Carlo Rosi} = 3 \\times 40 = 120\n   \\]\n3.

Sum the ages of the Franzia, Carlo Rosi, and Twin Valley wines.\n\nFirst, let's find the age of the Franzia wine:\n\\[\n\\text{Age of Franzia} = 3 \\times \\text{Age of Carlo Rosi} = 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find the age of the Twin Valley wine:\n\\[\n\\text{Age of Twin Valley} = \\frac{\\text{Age of Carlo Rosi}}{4} = \\frac{40}{4} = 10 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the ages of the three brands of wine:\n\\[\n\\text{Total age} = \\text{Age of Franzia} + \\text{Age of Carlo Rosi} + \\text{Age of Twin Valley} = 120 + 40 + 10 = 170 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total age of the three brands of wine is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{170}\n\\]",
