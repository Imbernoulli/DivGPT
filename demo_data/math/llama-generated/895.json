He takes out 4 pairs of pants, 4 jumpers, 4 pajama sets (top and bottom), and 20 t-shirts, then asks his friends if they have anything they want to donate. 3 of his friends donate the same amount of clothing as Adam each. Then he takes another look over his clothing and decides that he actually wants to keep half of his clothes.

        "First, we need to calculate the total number of articles of clothing Adam initially takes out of his wardrobe.

Since each of his 3 friends donates the same amount of clothing as Adam, the total number of articles of clothing donated by his friends is:\n\\[3 \\times 36 = 108\\]\n\nNow, we add the clothing donated by Adam and his friends to get the total number of articles of clothing donated so far:\n\\[36 + 108 = 144\\]\n\nHowever, Adam decides that he actually wants to keep half of his clothes. Therefore, he will only donate half of the 36 articles of clothing he initially took out. The number of articles of clothing Adam will donate is:\n\\[\\frac{36}{2} = 18\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of articles of clothing Adam keeps from the total number of articles of clothing donated by Adam and his friends to get the final number of articles of clothing being donated:\n\\[144 - 18 = 126\\]\n\nThus, the total number of articles of clothing being donated is:\n\\[\\boxed{126}\\]",
