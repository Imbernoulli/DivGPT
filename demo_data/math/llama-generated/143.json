Calculate the cost of the dresses:\n   Rita bought 5 dresses, and each dress costs $20.\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 20 = 100\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the dresses is $100.\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the pants:\n   Rita bought 3 pairs of pants, and each pair costs $12.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 12 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the pants is $36.\n\n3. Calculate the cost of the jackets:\n   Rita bought 4 jackets, and each jacket costs $30.\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 30 = 120\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the jackets is $120.\n\n4. Calculate the total cost of all the clothes:\n   Add the cost of the dresses, the pants, and the jackets.\n   \\[\n   100 + 36 + 120 = 256\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of all the clothes is $256.\n\n5. Add the cost of transportation:\n   Rita spent an additional $5 on transportation.\n   \\[\n   256 + 5 = 261\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount spent is $261.\n\n6. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money:\n   Rita initially had $400.\n   \\[\n   400 - 261 = 139\n   \\]\n   So, the amount of money Rita has now is $139.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{139}\n\\]",
