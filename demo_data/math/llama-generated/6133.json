A shark was swimming alongside him, riding the same wave, when it doubled its speed and moved away from Keanu.  There was a pilot fish swimming alongside Keanu and the shark, and when the shark increased its speed, the pilot fish also increased its speed and moved away from Keanu, but only increasing its speed by half as much as the shark had increased its speed by.  What speed, in miles per hour, was the pilot fish swimming when it moved away from Keanu?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the speed of the pilot fish when it moved away from Keanu, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial speed of the shark.\n2. Calculate the increase in speed of the shark.\n3. Determine the increase in speed of the pilot fish.\n4. Calculate the new speed of the pilot fish.\n\nLet's start with the initial speed of the shark. Since the shark was swimming alongside Keanu, which was surfing at a speed of 20 miles per hour, the initial speed of the shark is also 20 miles per hour.\n\nNext, the shark doubles its speed. Therefore, the increase in speed of the shark is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 1 = 30 \\text{ miles per hour} - 20 \\text{ miles per hour} = 20 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\nSo, the new speed of the shark is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ miles per hour} + 20 \\text{ miles per hour} = 40 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nThe pilot fish increases its speed by half as much as the shark increased its speed. Since the shark increased its speed by 20 miles per hour, the increase in speed of the pilot fish is:\n\\[ \\frac{20 \\text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\nSo, the new speed of the pilot fish is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ miles per hour} + 10 \\text{ miles per hour} = 30 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed of the pilot fish when it moved away from Keanu is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",
        "To determine the speed of the pilot fish when it moved away from Keanu, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the initial speed of the shark:**\n   The shark is swimming alongside Keanu at the same speed as Keanu.

Since the shark was initially swimming at the same speed as Keanu:\n\\[ \\text{Shark's initial speed} = 20 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Shark's new speed} = 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nThe increase in the shark's speed is:\n\\[ \\text{Increase in shark's speed} = 40 - 20 = 20 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nThe pilot fish increases its speed by half as much as the shark increased its speed:\n\\[ \\text{Increase in pilot fish's speed} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nSince the pilot fish was initially swimming at the same speed as Keanu:\n\\[ \\text{Pilot fish's initial speed} = 20 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Pilot fish's new speed} = 20 + 10 = 30 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed of the pilot fish when it moved away from Keanu is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",
