        "To determine how many bills Geric had at the beginning, we need to follow the information given step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define the number of bills Jessa initially had as \\( J \\). According to the problem, after giving 3 bills to Geric, Jessa has 7 bills left. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ J - 3 = 7 \\]\nSolving for \\( J \\), we get:\n\\[ J = 7 + 3 = 10 \\]\nSo, Jessa initially had 10 bills.\n\nNext, we know that Kyla has 2 fewer bills than Jessa. Therefore, the number of bills Kyla has is:\n\\[ K = J - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \\]\nSo, Kyla initially had 8 bills.\n\nGeric had twice as many bills as Kyla. Therefore, the number of bills Geric has is:\n\\[ G = 2 \\times K = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\nSo, Geric initially had 16 bills.\n\nThus, the number of bills Geric had at the beginning is:\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]",

        "Let's denote the number of bills Jessa initially has as \\( J \\). According to the problem, after giving 3 bills to Geric, Jessa has 7 bills left.

Next, we know that Kyla has 2 fewer bills than Jessa. Therefore, the number of bills Kyla has is:\n\n\\[ K = J - 2 \\]\n\\[ K = 10 - 2 \\]\n\\[ K = 8 \\]\n\nGeric has twice as many bills as Kyla.
