        "To determine the average number of pastries the baker sells each day, we need to calculate the total number of pastries sold over the week and then divide that by the number of days he works.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of pastries sold each day. The baker starts with 2 pastries on Monday and increases the number of pastries sold by 1 each subsequent day. Therefore, the number of pastries sold each day is as follows:\n\n- Monday: 2\n- Tuesday: 2 + 1 = 3\n- Wednesday: 3 + 1 = 4\n- Thursday: 4 + 1 = 5\n- Friday: 5 + 1 = 6\n- Saturday: 6 + 1 = 7\n- Sunday: 7 + 1 = 8\n\nNext, we sum the number of pastries sold over the week:\n\n\\[\n2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8\n\\]\n\nWe can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to simplify this calculation. The sum \\( S \\) of the first \\( n \\) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the number of terms,\n- \\( a \\) is the first term,\n- \\( l \\) is the last term.\n\nIn this case, \\( n = 7 \\), \\( a = 2 \\), and \\( l = 8 \\). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{7}{2} \\times (2 + 8) = \\frac{7}{2} \\times 10 = 7 \\times 5 = 35\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of pastries sold in a week is 35.\n\nTo find the average number of pastries sold each day, we divide the total number of pastries by the number of days:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{35}{7} = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of pastries the baker sells each day is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
