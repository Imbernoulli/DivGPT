        "To determine how much John makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate John's new hourly wage:**\n   John gets a 30% raise from his former $20 an hour job. First, we calculate 30% of $20:\n   \\[\n   0.30 \\times 20 = 6\n   \\]\n   Adding this raise to his former wage:\n   \\[\n   20 + 6 = 26\n   \\]\n   So, John's new hourly wage is $26.\n\n2. **Determine the number of days John works in a 30-day month:**\n   John works every other day. In a 30-day month, the number of days he works is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of hours John works in the month:**\n   John works 12 hours each day he works. Therefore, the total number of hours he works in the month is:\n   \\[\n   15 \\times 12 = 180\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate John's total earnings for the month:**\n   John earns $26 per hour and works 180 hours in the month. His total earnings are:\n   \\[\n   26 \\times 180 = 4680\n   \\]\n\nThus, John makes \\(\\boxed{4680}\\) dollars in a 30-day month.",
