        "To find the total number of students in the three grades, we need to calculate the number of students in each grade and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of students in the 3rd grade. We are given that there are 19 students in the 3rd grade.\n\nNext, let's determine the number of students in the 4th grade. We are given that there are twice as many students in the 4th grade as there are in the 3rd grade. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[ 2 \\times 19 = 38 \\]\nSo, there are 38 students in the 4th grade.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of students in the 2nd grade. We are given that there are 10 boys and 19 girls in the 2nd grade. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[ 10 + 19 = 29 \\]\nSo, there are 29 students in the 2nd grade.\n\nFinally, we sum the number of students in all three grades:\n\\[ 19 + 38 + 29 = 86 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of students is \\(\\boxed{86}\\).",

Next, we find the number of students in the 4th grade. The problem states that there are twice as many students in the 4th grade as in the 3rd grade. Therefore, we multiply the number of students in the 3rd grade by 2.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students in the 4th grade} = 2 \\times 19 = 38\n   \\]\n\n3. Then, we find the number of students in the 2nd grade. The problem gives us that there are 10 boys and 19 girls in the 2nd grade. To find the total number of students in the 2nd grade, we add the number of boys and the number of girls.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students in the 2nd grade} = 10 + 19 = 29\n   \\]\n\n4.
