        "To determine how many pennies Grace will have by exchanging her 10 dimes and 10 nickels, we need to convert each type of coin into pennies and then sum the results.\n\nFirst, let's convert the dimes into pennies. Since each dime is worth 10 pennies, the value of 10 dimes in pennies is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ dimes} \\times 10 \\text{ pennies per dime} = 100 \\text{ pennies} \\]\n\nNext, let's convert the nickels into pennies. Since each nickel is worth 5 pennies, the value of 10 nickels in pennies is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ nickels} \\times 5 \\text{ pennies per nickel} = 50 \\text{ pennies} \\]\n\nNow, we add the value of the dimes and the value of the nickels to find the total number of pennies:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ pennies} + 50 \\text{ pennies} = 150 \\text{ pennies} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pennies Grace will have is:\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]",
