        "To determine the total cost of the slippers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discount on the slippers.\n2. Add the cost of the embroidery.\n3. Add the shipping cost.\n\nLet's start with the discount. The original price of the slippers is $50.00 and they are 10% off. The discount amount is:\n\\[ 50.00 \\times 0.10 = 5.00 \\]\nSo, the price of the slippers after the discount is:\n\\[ 50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00 \\]\n\nNext, we need to add the cost of the embroidery. The embroidery is $5.50 per shoe, and since there are two shoes, the total embroidery cost is:\n\\[ 5.50 \\times 2 = 11.00 \\]\n\nNow, we add the shipping cost, which is a flat rate of $10.00. The total cost of the slippers is:\n\\[ 45.00 + 11.00 + 10.00 = 66.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the slippers is:\n\\[ \\boxed{66.00} \\]",

To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 10% (or 0.10):\n\\[ 50.00 \\times 0.10 = 5.00 \\]\nSo, the discount is $5.00. Subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price:\n\\[ 50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00 \\]\nThe sale price of the slippers is $45.00.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost of the embroidery.**\n\nThe embroidery cost is $5.50 per shoe. Since there are two shoes, we multiply the cost per shoe by 2:\n\\[ 5.50 \\times 2 = 11.00 \\]\nSo, the total embroidery cost is $11.00.\n\n**Step 3: Add the shipping cost.**\n\nThe shipping cost is a flat rate of $10.00. We add this to the sale price of the slippers and the embroidery cost:\n\\[ 45.00 + 11.00 + 10.00 = 66.00 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Sum all the costs.**\n\nThe total cost of the slippers is \\(\\boxed{66.00}\\).",
