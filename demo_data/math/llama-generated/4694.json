Mike used 2 square feet more paint than Mary used on her dragon:\n\\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \\]\nSo, Mike used 5 square feet of paint to paint the castle.\n\nNow, we determine the total amount of paint used for the dragon and the castle:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\nSo, a total of 8 square feet of paint was used for the dragon and the castle.\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount of paint used for the dragon and the castle from the original amount of paint in the jar to find out how much paint is left:\n\\[ 13 - 8 = 5 \\]\nSo, there are 5 square feet of paint left.\n\nThe remaining paint will be used to paint the sun. Therefore, the number of square feet of paint that can be used to paint the sun is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]",
        "To determine how many square feet of paint can be used to paint the sun, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of paint Mary uses:**\n   Mary paints a dragon using 3 square feet of paint.\n\n2. **Calculate the amount of paint Mike uses:**\n   Mike paints a castle using 2 square feet more than Mary. Therefore, the amount of paint Mike uses is:\n   \\[\n   3 + 2 = 5 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of paint used by Mary and Mike:**\n   Add the amount of paint Mary uses to the amount of paint Mike uses:\n   \\[\n   3 + 5 = 8 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the amount of paint left after painting the dragon and the castle:**\n   Subtract the total amount of paint used from the original amount of paint in the jar:\n   \\[\n   13 - 8 = 5 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the amount of paint available to paint the sun:**\n   Since they both work together to paint the sun and there is 5 square feet of paint left, the amount of paint that can be used to paint the sun is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{5}\n   \\]",
