Convert the total jogging time from minutes to hours:\n   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:\n   \\[\n   180 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Ayen jogged this week is \\boxed{3}.",
