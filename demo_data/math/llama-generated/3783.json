        "To determine the number of junk items in Mason's attic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the total number of items in the attic:**\n   - We know that 20% of the items are useful.\n   - Mason has 8 useful items.\n   - Let \\( T \\) be the total number of items in the attic.\n   - Since 20% of the total items are useful, we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     0.20T = 8\n     \\]\n   - To find \\( T \\), we solve for \\( T \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.20:\n     \\[\n     T = \\frac{8}{0.20} = 40\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of junk items:**\n   - We know that 70% of the items are junk.\n   - Since the total number of items \\( T \\) is 40, the number of junk items is:\n     \\[\n     0.70T = 0.70 \\times 40 = 28\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of junk items in Mason's attic is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
