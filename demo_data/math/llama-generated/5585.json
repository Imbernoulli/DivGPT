        "To determine how many more dolls with black and brown hair combined Lindsay has than blonde-haired dolls, we start by calculating the number of each type of doll she has.\n\nFirst, we know Lindsay has 4 dolls with blonde hair. This is given directly in the problem.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many dolls with brown hair Lindsay has. The problem states that she has four times more dolls with brown hair than blonde hair. Therefore, we calculate the number of brown-haired dolls as follows:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ (blonde-haired dolls)} \\times 4 = 16 \\text{ (brown-haired dolls)}\n\\]\n\nThen, we need to find out how many dolls with black hair Lindsay has. The problem states that she has 2 fewer dolls with black hair than brown hair. Therefore, we calculate the number of black-haired dolls as follows:\n\\[\n16 \\text{ (brown-haired dolls)} - 2 = 14 \\text{ (black-haired dolls)}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of dolls with black and brown hair combined. We add the number of brown-haired dolls and the number of black-haired dolls:\n\\[\n16 \\text{ (brown-haired dolls)} + 14 \\text{ (black-haired dolls)} = 30 \\text{ (black and brown-haired dolls combined)}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we need to determine how many more dolls with black and brown hair combined Lindsay has than blonde-haired dolls. We subtract the number of blonde-haired dolls from the total number of black and brown-haired dolls:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ (black and brown-haired dolls combined)} - 4 \\text{ (blonde-haired dolls)} = 26\n\\]\n\nThus, Lindsay has \\(\\boxed{26}\\) more dolls with black and brown hair combined than blonde-haired dolls.",

She has 2 fewer dolls with black hair than brown hair, so we calculate:\n\\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \\]\nSo, Lindsay has 14 dolls with black hair.\n\nNow, we combine the number of dolls with brown hair and black hair:\n\\[ 16 + 14 = 30 \\]\nSo, Lindsay has 30 dolls with brown and black hair combined.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how many more dolls with black and brown hair combined Lindsay has than blonde-haired dolls.

Calculate the difference between the total number of black and brown-haired dolls and the number of blonde-haired dolls.\n\nLet's start with the number of blonde-haired dolls:\nLindsay has 4 blonde-haired dolls.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of brown-haired dolls:\nLindsay has four times more dolls with brown hair than blonde hair. Therefore, the number of brown-haired dolls is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\]\n\nNow, we determine the number of black-haired dolls:\nLindsay has 2 fewer dolls with black hair than brown hair. Therefore, the number of black-haired dolls is:\n\\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of black and brown-haired dolls:\n\\[ 16 + 14 = 30 \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the total number of black and brown-haired dolls and the number of blonde-haired dolls:\n\\[ 30 - 4 = 26 \\]\n\nThus, Lindsay has \\(\\boxed{26}\\) more dolls with black and brown hair combined than blonde-haired dolls.",
