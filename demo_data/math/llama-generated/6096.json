        "To determine how many more glasses of lemonade Tina sold than Katya, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of glasses of lemonade sold by Katya and Ricky combined.\n2. Determine how many glasses of lemonade Tina sold.\n3. Find the difference between the number of glasses of lemonade sold by Tina and Katya.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of glasses of lemonade sold by Katya and Ricky combined:\n\\[\n8 + 9 = 17\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many glasses of lemonade Tina sold. Since Tina sold twice as many glasses as Katya and Ricky's combined sales, we multiply the total by 2:\n\\[\n2 \\times 17 = 34\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of glasses of lemonade sold by Tina and Katya:\n\\[\n34 - 8 = 26\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Tina sold \\(\\boxed{26}\\) more glasses of lemonade than Katya.",
        "First, we need to determine the total number of glasses of lemonade sold by Katya and Ricky combined.

According to the problem, Tina sold twice as many glasses as Katya and Ricky's combined sales. Therefore, we multiply the combined total by 2:\n\n\\[17 \\times 2 = 34\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more glasses of lemonade Tina sold than Katya. Katya sold 8 glasses, so we subtract the number of glasses Katya sold from the number of glasses Tina sold:\n\n\\[34 - 8 = 26\\]\n\nThus, Tina sold \\(\\boxed{26}\\) more glasses of lemonade than Katya.",
