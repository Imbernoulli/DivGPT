        "To determine how many pencils Ashton has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pencils Ashton initially had.\n2. Subtract the number of pencils he gave to his brother.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of pencils Ashton initially had. He had two boxes of pencils, and each box contained 14 pencils. Therefore, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of pencils per box:\n\\[ 2 \\times 14 = 28 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of pencils Ashton gave to his brother. He gave away 6 pencils, so we subtract 6 from the total number of pencils he initially had:\n\\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \\]\n\nThus, the number of pencils Ashton has left is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",

Since he had two boxes of pencils and each box contained fourteen pencils, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of pencils per box:\n\n\\[ 2 \\text{ boxes} \\times 14 \\text{ pencils per box} = 28 \\text{ pencils} \\]\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of pencils Ashton gave to his brother from the total number of pencils he initially had. Ashton gave six pencils to his brother, so we subtract 6 from 28:\n\n\\[ 28 \\text{ pencils} - 6 \\text{ pencils} = 22 \\text{ pencils} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pencils Ashton has left is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",
