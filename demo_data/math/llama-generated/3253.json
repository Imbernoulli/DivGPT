        "To determine how many push-ups Jackie can do in one minute if she takes two 8-second breaks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time Jackie spends on breaks.\n2. Subtract the break time from the total time available (one minute).\n3. Determine how many push-ups Jackie can do in the remaining time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Jackie spends on breaks:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ breaks} \\times 8 \\text{ seconds per break} = 16 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, subtract the break time from the total time available (60 seconds):\n\\[ 60 \\text{ seconds} - 16 \\text{ seconds} = 44 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many push-ups Jackie can do in the remaining 44 seconds. We know that Jackie can do 5 push-ups in 10 seconds. Therefore, we can find out how many push-ups she can do in 44 seconds by setting up a proportion:\n\\[ \\frac{5 \\text{ push-ups}}{10 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{x \\text{ push-ups}}{44 \\text{ seconds}} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{5 \\text{ push-ups} \\times 44 \\text{ seconds}}{10 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{220 \\text{ push-ups} \\cdot \\text{seconds}}{10 \\text{ seconds}} = 22 \\text{ push-ups} \\]\n\nSo, the number of push-ups Jackie can do in one minute if she takes two 8-second breaks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{22} \\]",

Subtract the break time from the total time available (one minute).\n3. Determine how many push-ups Jackie can do in the remaining time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Jackie spends on breaks. Since she takes two breaks and each break is 8 seconds, the total break time is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the break time from the total time available (one minute). One minute is 60 seconds, so the time available for push-ups is:\n\\[ 60 - 16 = 44 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many push-ups Jackie can do in 44 seconds.
