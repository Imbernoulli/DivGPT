        "To determine the total number of pieces of bread and treats that Wanda and Jane brought to the zoo, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of treats Wanda brought:**\n   Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, which is three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Let \\( t_W \\) represent the number of treats Wanda brought. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   3t_W = 90\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( t_W \\):\n   \\[\n   t_W = \\frac{90}{3} = 30\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of treats Jane brought:**\n   Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane. Let \\( t_J \\) represent the number of treats Jane brought. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   t_W = \\frac{1}{2}t_J\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( t_W = 30 \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   30 = \\frac{1}{2}t_J\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( t_J \\):\n   \\[\n   t_J = 30 \\times 2 = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of pieces of bread Jane brought:**\n   Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats. Let \\( b_J \\) represent the number of pieces of bread Jane brought. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   b_J = 0.75t_J\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( t_J = 60 \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   b_J = 0.75 \\times 60 = 45\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of pieces of bread and treats brought by Jane:**\n   The total number of pieces of bread and treats Jane brought is:\n   \\[\n   t_J + b_J = 60 + 45 = 105\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of pieces of bread and treats brought by Wanda:**\n   The total number of pieces of bread and treats Wanda brought is:\n   \\[\n   t_W + b_W = 30 + 90 = 120\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total number of pieces of bread and treats brought by both Jane and Wanda:**\n   The total number of pieces of bread and treats brought by both Jane and Wanda is:\n   \\[\n   105 + 120 = 225\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pieces of bread and treats that Wanda and Jane brought to the zoo is \\(\\boxed{225}\\).",
        "Let's define the number of treats Jane brings as \\( T \\). According to the problem, Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats. Therefore, the number of pieces of bread Jane brings is \\( 0.75T \\).\n\nWanda brings half as many treats as Jane, so the number of treats Wanda brings is \\( \\frac{T}{2} \\). Wanda also brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, so the number of pieces of bread Wanda brings is \\( 3 \\times \\frac{T}{2} = \\frac{3T}{2} \\).\n\nWe know from the problem that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{3T}{2} = 90\n\\]\nTo find \\( T \\), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 2:\n\\[\n3T = 180\n\\]\nNext, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[\nT = 60\n\\]\nSo, Jane brings 60 treats. Since Jane brings \\( 0.75T \\) pieces of bread, the number of pieces of bread Jane brings is:\n\\[\n0.75 \\times 60 = 45\n\\]\nWanda brings \\( \\frac{T}{2} \\) treats, so the number of treats Wanda brings is:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{2} = 30\n\\]\nWe already know that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread. Therefore, the total number of pieces of bread and treats that Wanda and Jane brought to the zoo is:\n\\[\n45 + 60 + 90 + 30 = 225\n\\]\nSo, the total number of pieces of bread and treats that Wanda and Jane brought to the zoo is \\(\\boxed{225}\\).",

Therefore, the number of treats Wanda brought is:\n\\[\n\\text{Treats Wanda brought} = \\frac{90}{3} = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many treats Jane brought. We know that Wanda brought half as many treats as Jane. Therefore, the number of treats Jane brought is:\n\\[\n\\text{Treats Jane brought} = 30 \\times 2 = 60\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many pieces of bread Jane brought.

Therefore, the number of pieces of bread Jane brings is:\n\\[ B_J = 0.75T_J \\]\n\nNext, we know that Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane. So, the number of treats Wanda brings is:\n\\[ T_W = \\frac{1}{2}T_J \\]\n\nWe are also given that Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Therefore, the number of pieces of bread Wanda brings is:\n\\[ B_W = 3T_W \\]\n\nWe know from the problem that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread. So, we can substitute 90 for \\( B_W \\) in the equation \\( B_W = 3T_W \\):\n\\[ 90 = 3T_W \\]\n\nTo find \\( T_W \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ T_W = \\frac{90}{3} = 30 \\]\n\nSince \\( T_W = \\frac{1}{2}T_J \\), we can substitute 30 for \\( T_W \\) to find \\( T_J \\):\n\\[ 30 = \\frac{1}{2}T_J \\]\n\nTo find \\( T_J \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ T_J = 30 \\times 2 = 60 \\]\n\nNow that we know Jane brings 60 treats, we can find the number of pieces of bread Jane brings using the equation \\( B_J = 0.75T_J \\):\n\\[ B_J = 0.75 \\times 60 = 45 \\]\n\nSo, Jane brings 45 pieces of bread and 60 treats, and Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread and 30 treats. To find the total number of pieces of bread and treats that Wanda and Jane brought to the zoo, we add up all these quantities:\n\\[ B_J + T_J + B_W + T_W = 45 + 60 + 90 + 30 = 225 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pieces of bread and treats that Wanda and Jane brought to the zoo is:\n\\[ \\boxed{225} \\]"
