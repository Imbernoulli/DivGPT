        "To determine how much money Roberta has left after her shopping trip, we need to calculate the total amount she spends and subtract it from the $158 she initially had. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the new bag:**\n   Roberta spends $17 less on the new bag than she does on the new shoes. Since she spends $45 on new shoes, the cost of the new bag is:\n   \\[\n   45 - 17 = 28 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of lunch:**\n   Roberta spends a quarter of the price of the bag on lunch. Since the bag costs $28, the cost of lunch is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{28}{4} = 7 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**\n   Roberta spends $45 on new shoes, $28 on a new bag, and $7 on lunch. The total amount spent is:\n   \\[\n   45 + 28 + 7 = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the remaining money:**\n   Roberta initially had $158. After spending $80, the amount of money she has left is:\n   \\[\n   158 - 80 = 78 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Roberta has left after these purchases is \\(\\boxed{78}\\).",

Since she spends $45 on the shoes, we can calculate the cost of the bag as follows:\n\\[\n45 - 17 = 28\n\\]\nSo, Roberta spends $28 on the new bag.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much Roberta spends on lunch. She spends a quarter of the price of the bag on lunch. Since the bag costs $28, we can calculate the cost of lunch as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{28}{4} = 7\n\\]\nSo, Roberta spends $7 on lunch.\n\nNow, let's find the total amount Roberta spends on all her purchases. She spends $45 on shoes, $28 on the bag, and $7 on lunch. Adding these amounts together, we get:\n\\[\n45 + 28 + 7 = 80\n\\]\nSo, Roberta spends a total of $80.\n\nFinally, let's determine how much money Roberta has left after her purchases. She started with $158 and spent $80, so we subtract the amount spent from the initial amount:\n\\[\n158 - 80 = 78\n\\]\nTherefore, the amount of money Roberta has left after these purchases is \\boxed{78}.",

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial amount of money:**\n   Roberta starts with $158.\n\n2. **Cost of new shoes:**\n   Roberta spends $45 on new shoes.\n\n3. **Cost of new bag:**\n   Roberta spends $17 less on a new bag than she does on new shoes. Therefore, the cost of the bag is:\n   \\[\n   45 - 17 = 28 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cost of lunch:**\n   Roberta spends a quarter of the price of the bag on lunch. Therefore, the cost of lunch is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{28}{4} = 7 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Total amount spent:**\n   To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the shoes, the bag, and lunch:\n   \\[\n   45 + 28 + 7 = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Amount of money left:**\n   To find out how much money Roberta has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:\n   \\[\n   158 - 80 = 78 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Roberta has left after these purchases is \\(\\boxed{78}\\).",
        "To determine how much money Roberta has left after her shopping trip and lunch, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the new bag.\n2. Calculate the cost of lunch.\n3. Sum up all the expenses.\n4. Subtract the total expenses from the initial amount of money Roberta had.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of the new bag. The bag costs $17 less than the shoes. Since the shoes cost $45, the bag costs:\n\\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of lunch. Lunch costs a quarter of the price of the bag. Since the bag costs $28, lunch costs:\n\\[ \\frac{28}{4} = 7 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we sum up all the expenses. The expenses are the cost of the shoes, the cost of the bag, and the cost of lunch:\n\\[ 45 + 28 + 7 = 80 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total expenses from the initial amount of money Roberta had.
