        "To determine how many books Billy reads, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of free time Billy has over the weekend.\n2. Determine how much time Billy spends playing video games and how much time he spends reading.\n3. Calculate the total number of pages Billy reads.\n4. Determine how many books Billy reads based on the total number of pages he reads.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of free time Billy has over the weekend.**\n\nBilly has 8 hours of free time each day on the weekend. Since there are 2 days in the weekend, we multiply the daily free time by the number of days:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 16 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much time Billy spends playing video games and how much time he spends reading.**\n\nBilly wants to spend 75% of his free time playing video games. Therefore, we calculate 75% of 16 hours:\n\\[ 0.75 \\times 16 \\text{ hours} = 12 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe rest of his time is spent reading. Since the total free time is 16 hours and he spends 12 hours playing video games, the time spent reading is:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ hours} - 12 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pages Billy reads.**\n\nBilly can read 60 pages per hour. Therefore, the total number of pages he reads in 4 hours is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ pages/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 240 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine how many books Billy reads based on the total number of pages he reads.**\n\nEach book contains 80 pages. To find out how many books Billy reads, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages per book:\n\\[ \\frac{240 \\text{ pages}}{80 \\text{ pages/book}} = 3 \\text{ books} \\]\n\nThus, the number of books Billy reads is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]",

Therefore, the time spent reading is:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ hours} - 12 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of pages Billy reads.**\n\nBilly can read 60 pages an hour. Therefore, the total number of pages he reads is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ pages/hour} = 240 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\n**Step 5: Determine how many books Billy reads.**\n\nEach book contains 80 pages. Therefore, the number of books Billy reads is:\n\\[ \\frac{240 \\text{ pages}}{80 \\text{ pages/book}} = 3 \\text{ books} \\]\n\nThus, the number of books Billy reads is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

        "To determine how many books Billy reads over the weekend, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total free time over the weekend:**\n   Billy has 8 hours of free time each day on the weekend. Since the weekend consists of 2 days, we multiply the daily free time by the number of days:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 16 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the time spent playing video games:**\n   Billy wants to spend 75% of his free time playing video games.

We subtract the time spent playing video games from the total free time:\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ hours} - 12 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the total number of pages read:**\n   Billy can read 60 pages per hour.
