Add the weight of the stuffing to the weight of the chicken to get the total weight of the dish:\n   \\[\n   72 \\text{ ounces} + 24 \\text{ ounces} = 96 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n   So, the total weight of Chicken Surprise is 96 ounces.\n\n3. Divide the total weight by the number of servings to find the weight per serving:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{96 \\text{ ounces}}{12 \\text{ servings}} = 8 \\text{ ounces/serving}\n   \\]\n   So, one serving of Chicken Surprise is 8 ounces.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",
