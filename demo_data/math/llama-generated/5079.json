        "To determine the total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of lilies Nadia bought.\n2. Determine the cost of the roses.\n3. Determine the cost of the lilies.\n4. Add the cost of the roses and the cost of the lilies to get the total amount spent.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of lilies Nadia bought. Nadia bought \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) times as many lilies as roses. Since she bought 20 roses, the number of lilies is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 20 = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, let's determine the cost of the roses. Each rose costs $5, so the total cost for the roses is:\n\\[\n20 \\times 5 = 100\n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine the cost of the lilies. Each lily costs twice as much as a rose, so each lily costs \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\) dollars. Therefore, the total cost for the lilies is:\n\\[\n15 \\times 10 = 150\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's add the cost of the roses and the cost of the lilies to get the total amount spent:\n\\[\n100 + 150 = 250\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{250}\n\\]",

She bought \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) times as many lilies as roses. Since she bought 20 roses, we can find the number of lilies by multiplying 20 by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Number of lilies} = 20 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the cost of the roses. Each rose costs $5, and Nadia bought 20 roses. Therefore, the total cost of the roses is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of roses} = 20 \\times 5 = 100\n\\]\n\nThen, we determine the cost of the lilies. Each lily costs twice as much as a rose, so each lily costs $5 \\times 2 = $10. Since Nadia bought 15 lilies, the total cost of the lilies is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of lilies} = 15 \\times 10 = 150\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the cost of the roses and the cost of the lilies to find the total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 100 + 150 = 250\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Nadia used to buy the flowers is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",
