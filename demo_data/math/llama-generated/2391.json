        "To determine how long it will take Jon to make the same amount of money that Karen does in 3 months, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Karen's monthly salary.\n2. Determine Karen's total earnings over 3 months.\n3. Calculate how long it will take Jon to earn the same amount of money.\n\nFirst, we know that Jon makes \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of Karen's salary. Jon's monthly salary is $3000. Let \\(K\\) be Karen's monthly salary. We can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}K = 3000\n\\]\nTo find \\(K\\), we solve for \\(K\\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\):\n\\[\nK = 3000 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 4000\n\\]\nSo, Karen's monthly salary is $4000.\n\nNext, we calculate Karen's total earnings over 3 months:\n\\[\n4000 \\times 3 = 12000\n\\]\nKaren earns $12000 in 3 months.\n\nNow, we need to determine how long it will take Jon to earn $12000. Since Jon's monthly salary is $3000, we divide $12000 by $3000:\n\\[\n\\frac{12000}{3000} = 4\n\\]\nSo, it will take Jon 4 months to earn the same amount of money that Karen earns in 3 months.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

We know that Jon makes \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of Karen's salary, and Jon's monthly salary is $3000. Let \\(K\\) be Karen's monthly salary. Then we can write the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}K = 3000\n\\]\nTo solve for \\(K\\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\):\n\\[\nK = 3000 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 4000\n\\]\nSo, Karen's monthly salary is $4000.\n\nNext, we calculate Karen's total salary over 3 months:\n\\[\n4000 \\times 3 = 12000\n\\]\nKaren makes $12000 in 3 months. Now, we need to find out how many months Jon will need to make $12000. Since Jon's monthly salary is $3000, we divide $12000 by $3000:\n\\[\n\\frac{12000}{3000} = 4\n\\]\nSo, Jon will need 4 months to make the same amount of money that Karen does in 3 months.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",

Calculate Karen's total earnings over 3 months.\n3. Determine how long it will take Jon to earn the same amount of money.\n\nFirst, let's denote Karen's monthly salary as \\( K \\). According to the problem, Jon makes \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of Karen's salary. We know that Jon's monthly salary is $3000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 3000 = \\frac{3}{4} K \\]\n\nTo find \\( K \\), we need to solve for \\( K \\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), which is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\):\n\n\\[ K = 3000 \\times \\frac{4}{3} \\]\n\n\\[ K = 4000 \\]\n\nSo, Karen's monthly salary is $4000. Next, we calculate Karen's total earnings over 3 months:\n\n\\[ \\text{Karen's total earnings in 3 months} = 4000 \\times 3 = 12000 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how long it will take Jon to earn $12000. Since Jon's monthly salary is $3000, we can find the number of months by dividing $12000 by $3000:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of months Jon needs} = \\frac{12000}{3000} = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jon \\(\\boxed{4}\\) months to make the same amount of money that Karen does in 3 months.",
