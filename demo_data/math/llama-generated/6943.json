        "To determine how many dinner rolls are leftover, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of people in each group:**\n   - There are 16 people in total.\n   - Half of the people eat 1 1/2 rolls each.\n   - Half of the people eat 1/2 a roll each.\n\n   Therefore, the number of people in each group is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n   \\]\n   So, there are 8 people who eat 1 1/2 rolls each and 8 people who eat 1/2 a roll each.\n\n2. **Convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:**\n   - \\(1 \\frac{1}{2}\\) can be converted to an improper fraction by adding the whole number and the fraction:\n     \\[\n     1 \\frac{1}{2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of rolls consumed by the first group:**\n   - Each of the 8 people who eat 1 1/2 rolls each consumes \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) rolls.\n   - Therefore, the total number of rolls consumed by the first group is:\n     \\[\n     8 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 8 \\times 1.5 = 12\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of rolls consumed by the second group:**\n   - Each of the 8 people who eat 1/2 a roll each consumes \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) roll.\n   - Therefore, the total number of rolls consumed by the second group is:\n     \\[\n     8 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 8 \\times 0.5 = 4\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of rolls consumed by both groups:**\n   - Add the rolls consumed by the first group and the second group:\n     \\[\n     12 + 4 = 16\n     \\]\n\n6. **Determine the number of dinner rolls leftover:**\n   - Subtract the total number of rolls consumed from the total number of rolls available:\n     \\[\n     40 - 16 = 24\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of dinner rolls leftover is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]",
