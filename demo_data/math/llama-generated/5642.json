        "To determine how many trucks Jeff has, we start by defining variables for the number of cars and trucks. Let's denote the number of trucks Jeff has as \\( t \\). According to the problem, Jeff has twice as many cars as trucks. Therefore, the number of cars Jeff has can be represented as \\( 2t \\).\n\nThe total number of vehicles Jeff has is the sum of the number of cars and the number of trucks. We know from the problem that the total number of vehicles is 60. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 2t + t = 60 \\]\n\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 3t = 60 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( t \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of trucks Jeff has is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
