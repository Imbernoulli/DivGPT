        "First, let's determine the initial number of each type of fruit Jennifer has. Jennifer has 10 pears, 20 oranges, and twice as many apples as pears. Since she has twice as many apples as pears, we calculate the number of apples as follows:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 10 = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, Jennifer has 20 apples. Next, we calculate the total number of fruits she has initially by adding the number of pears, oranges, and apples:\n\n\\[\n10 + 20 + 20 = 50\n\\]\n\nJennifer gives her sister two of each fruit. Therefore, she gives away 2 pears, 2 oranges, and 2 apples. We subtract these amounts from the initial number of each type of fruit:\n\n\\[\n10 - 2 = 8 \\quad \\text{(pears left)}\n\\]\n\\[\n20 - 2 = 18 \\quad \\text{(oranges left)}\n\\]\n\\[\n20 - 2 = 18 \\quad \\text{(apples left)}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of fruits Jennifer has left by adding the remaining pears, oranges, and apples:\n\n\\[\n8 + 18 + 18 = 44\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of fruits Jennifer has left is \\(\\boxed{44}\\).",
