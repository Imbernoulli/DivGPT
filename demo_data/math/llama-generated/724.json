        "To determine the cost of the burger, we need to break down the total cost of the items Benjamin bought and solve for the unknown.\n\nFirst, let's identify the cost of each item:\n- One pack of fries costs $2.\n- Benjamin bought two packs of fries, so the total cost for the fries is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ packs} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per pack} = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\n- The salad costs three times the price of one pack of fries. Since one pack of fries costs $2, the cost of the salad is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 2 \\text{ dollars} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we know the total cost for all the items Benjamin bought is $15. Let \\( x \\) be the cost of the burger. According to the problem, the sum of the costs of the salad, the burger, and the two packs of fries is $15. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ dollars} + x + 4 \\text{ dollars} = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nCombine the known costs:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ dollars} + x = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), subtract 10 dollars from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nx = 15 \\text{ dollars} - 10 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost of the burger is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of the burger, we need to break down the total cost of Benjamin's purchase step by step.\n\nFirst, we know the cost of one pack of fries is $2.

Since one pack of fries costs $2, the cost of the salad is:\n\\[ 3 \\times \\$2 = \\$6 \\]\n\nNow, we can add the cost of the fries and the salad to find out how much Benjamin spent on these two items:\n\\[ \\$4 + \\$6 = \\$10 \\]\n\nBenjamin paid a total of $15. To find the cost of the burger, we subtract the total cost of the fries and the salad from the total amount paid:\n\\[ \\$15 - \\$10 = \\$5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the burger is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]",
        "To determine the cost of the burger, we start by defining the cost of each item Benjamin bought. We know the following:\n\n1. The cost of one pack of fries is $2.\n2.

The cost of the salad is three times the cost of one pack of fries. Since one pack of fries costs $2, the cost of the salad is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times \\$2 = \\$6\n   \\]\n4. Let the cost of the burger be \\( x \\) dollars. According to the problem, the total cost of all the items Benjamin bought is $15. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of salad} + \\text{Cost of burger} + \\text{Cost of fries} = \\$15\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values into the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\$6 + x + \\$4 = \\$15\n   \\]\n5. Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\$10 + x = \\$15\n   \\]\n6. To find the value of \\( x \\), subtract $10 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   x = \\$15 - \\$10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\$5\n   \\]\n\nThus, the cost of the burger is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

Since one pack of fries costs $2, the cost of the salad is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 2 \\text{ dollars} = 6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's denote the cost of the burger as \\( x \\) dollars. The total cost of all the items Benjamin bought is the sum of the cost of the salad, the cost of the burger, and the cost of the two packs of fries. According to the problem, the total cost is $15. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ dollars} + x \\text{ dollars} + 4 \\text{ dollars} = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nCombining the known costs, we get:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ dollars} + x \\text{ dollars} = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we subtract $10 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 15 \\text{ dollars} - 10 \\text{ dollars} = 5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the cost of the burger is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of the burger, we need to break down the total cost of Benjamin's purchase step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the salad:**\n   - One pack of fries costs $2.\n   - The salad is three times the price of one pack of fries.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of the salad} = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the two packs of fries:**\n   - One pack of fries costs $2.\n   - Benjamin bought two packs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of two packs of fries} = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum the costs of the salad and the fries:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of salad and fries} = 6 + 4 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the cost of the burger:**\n   - Benjamin paid a total of $15.\n   - Subtract the total cost of the salad and fries from the total amount paid.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of the burger} = 15 - 10 = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the cost of the burger is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of the burger, we need to break down the total cost of Benjamin's purchase step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of one pack of fries**: Given that one pack of fries costs $2.\n\n2. **Cost of two packs of fries**: Since each pack costs $2, two packs will cost:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ packs} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per pack} = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of the salad**: The salad costs three times the price of one pack of fries. Since one pack of fries costs $2, the salad will cost:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2 \\text{ dollars} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total cost of the salad and fries**: Adding the cost of the salad and the cost of the two packs of fries:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ dollars} + 4 \\text{ dollars} = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Total cost of the)])**: Benjamin paid $15 in total.\n\n6. **Cost of the burger**: To find the cost of the burger, we subtract the total cost of the salad and fries from the total amount paid:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ dollars} - 10 \\text{ dollars} = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the burger is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of the burger, we need to break down the total cost into the individual items Benjamin bought. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Identify the cost of one pack of fries. According to the problem, one pack of fries costs $2.\n2. Calculate the cost of two packs of fries. Since each pack costs $2, two packs will cost:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n3. Determine the cost of the salad. The problem states that the salad costs three times the price of one pack of fries. Since one pack of fries costs $2, the salad will cost:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n4. Let the cost of the burger be denoted by \\( x \\). According to the problem, the total cost of all the items Benjamin bought is $15. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   6 + x + 4 = 15\n   \\]\n5. Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   10 + x = 15\n   \\]\n6. Solve for \\( x \\) by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   x = 15 - 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 5\n   \\]\n\nThus, the cost of the burger is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) dollars.",
