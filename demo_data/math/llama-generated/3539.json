        "To determine the total number of cookies Annie ate over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cookies she ate each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that Annie ate 5 cookies on Monday.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many cookies she ate on Tuesday. The problem states that she ate two times more on Tuesday than on Monday. Therefore, we multiply the number of cookies she ate on Monday by 2:\n\\[\n5 \\times 2 = 10\n\\]\nSo, Annie ate 10 cookies on Tuesday.\n\nThen, we need to calculate how many cookies she ate on Wednesday. The problem states that she ate 40% more on Wednesday than on Tuesday. To find 40% more, we first calculate 40% of the number of cookies she ate on Tuesday and then add that to the number of cookies she ate on Tuesday. First, we calculate 40% of 10:\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 10 = 4\n\\]\nThen, we add this to the number of cookies she ate on Tuesday:\n\\[\n10 + 4 = 14\n\\]\nSo, Annie ate 14 cookies on Wednesday.\n\nNow, we sum the number of cookies she ate over the three days:\n\\[\n5 + 10 + 14 = 29\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of cookies Annie ate during these three days is \\boxed{29}.",
