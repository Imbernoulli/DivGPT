        "To determine the percent likelihood that a randomly selected balloon will be red, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of balloons after Kate inflates 4 more (two red and two blue).\n2. Determine the number of red balloons after the inflation.\n3. Compute the probability of selecting a red balloon by dividing the number of red balloons by the total number of balloons.\n4. Convert the probability to a percentage.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of balloons after inflation:**\n   - Initially, Kate has 2 red balloons and 4 blue balloons.\n   - She inflates 2 more red balloons and 2 more blue balloons.\n   - Therefore, the total number of red balloons after inflation is \\(2 + 2 = 4\\).\n   - The total number of blue balloons after inflation is \\(4 + 2 = 6\\).\n   - The total number of balloons after inflation is \\(4 + 6 = 10\\).\n\n2. **Determine the number of red balloons after the inflation:**\n   - As calculated, the number of red balloons after the inflation is 4.\n\n3. **Compute the probability of selecting a red balloon:**\n   - The probability \\(P\\) of selecting a red balloon is the number of red balloons divided by the total number of balloons.\n   - So, \\(P(\\text{red}) = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}\\).\n\n4. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**\n   - To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) to a percentage, we multiply by 100.\n   - Therefore, \\(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 100 = 40\\%\\).\n\nThe percent likelihood that a randomly selected balloon will be red is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
