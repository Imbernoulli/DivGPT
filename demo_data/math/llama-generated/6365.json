Therefore, the number of problem-solving questions can be calculated as follows:\n\\[\n0.80 \\times 50 = 40\n\\]\nSo, there are 40 problem-solving questions.\n\nSince the rest of the questions are multiple-choice, we subtract the number of problem-solving questions from the total number of questions:\n\\[\n50 - 40 = 10\n\\]\nThus, the number of multiple-choice questions is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "To determine the number of multiple-choice questions on Miss Lawrence's math exam, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of problem-solving questions.\n2. Subtract the number of problem-solving questions from the total number of questions to find the number of multiple-choice questions.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of problem-solving questions. We know that 80% of the 50 questions are problem-solving. So, we multiply 50 by 80% (which is equivalent to 0.80):\n\n\\[\n50 \\times 0.80 = 40\n\\]\n\nThis means there are 40 problem-solving questions. Next, we subtract the number of problem-solving questions from the total number of questions to find the number of multiple-choice questions:\n\n\\[\n50 - 40 = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of multiple-choice questions is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
