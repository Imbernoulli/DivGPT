Subtract the number of no-shows from the total number of expected attendees.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of no-shows. The expected number of attendees is 220, and 5% of them typically don't show up. We can find 5% of 220 by multiplying 220 by 0.05:\n\n\\[ 220 \\times 0.05 = 11 \\]\n\nSo, 11 people are expected not to show up.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of no-shows from the total number of expected attendees to find out how many people will actually attend the wedding:\n\n\\[ 220 - 11 = 209 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people who will go to Laura's wedding is \\(\\boxed{209}\\).",
