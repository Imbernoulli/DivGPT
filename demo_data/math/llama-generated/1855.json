Since Jessie won 3 times as many awards as Scott, we can calculate the number of awards Jessie won as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of awards Jessie won} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of awards Scott won} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that the best athlete at the rival high school won twice as many awards as Jessie. Therefore, we can calculate the number of awards the best athlete at the rival high school won as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of awards the best athlete at the rival high school won} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of awards Jessie won} = 2 \\times 12 = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of awards the best athlete at the rival high school won is \\boxed{24}.",
