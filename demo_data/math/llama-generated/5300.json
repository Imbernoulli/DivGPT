Therefore, the amount of beef he used is:\n\\[ 4 - 1 = 3 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we know that John used twice as many pounds of vegetables as beef. So, the amount of vegetables he used is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThus, the number of pounds of vegetables John used is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",
        "To determine how many pounds of vegetables John used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of beef John used in the soup:**\n   John bought 4 pounds of beef and used all but 1 pound.\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ pounds} - 1 \\text{ pound} = 3 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n   So, John used 3 pounds of beef in the soup.\n\n2. **Determine the amount of vegetables John used:**\n   John uses twice as many pounds of vegetables as beef.
