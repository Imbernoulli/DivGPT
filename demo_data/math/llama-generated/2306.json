        "To determine the speed of the spaceship when there are 400 people on board, we need to follow the given relationship: for every 100 additional people that board the spaceship, its speed is halved. We start with the initial conditions and apply the relationship step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Speed with 200 People:**\n   The speed of the spaceship with 200 people on board is given as 500 km per hour.\n\n2. **First 100 People Addition:**\n   When 100 more people board the spaceship, the speed is halved.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed with 300 people} = \\frac{500}{2} = 250 \\text{ km per hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Second 100 People Addition:**\n   When another 100 people board the spaceship, the speed is halved again.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed with 400 people} = \\frac{250}{2} = 125 \\text{ km per hour}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the speed of the spaceship when there are 400 people on board is \\(\\boxed{125}\\) km per hour.",

For every 100 additional people that board the spaceship, its speed is halved.\n\nFirst, we calculate the speed when there are 300 people on board. Since 300 people is 100 more than 200 people, the speed is halved from 500 km per hour:\n\\[\n\\text{Speed with 300 people} = \\frac{500}{2} = 250 \\text{ km per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the speed when there are 400 people on board. Since 400 people is 100 more than 300 people, the speed is halved from 250 km per hour:\n\\[\n\\text{Speed with 400 people} = \\frac{250}{2} = 125 \\text{ km per hour}\n\\]\n\nThus, the speed of the spaceship when there are 400 people on board is \\boxed{125} km per hour.",
        "We start with the information that for every 100 additional people that board the spaceship, its speed is halved. We are given that the speed of the spaceship with 200 people on board is 500 km per hour. We need to find the speed of the spaceship when there are 400 people on board.\n\nFirst, we determine how many additional people have boarded the spaceship from 200 people to 400 people:\n\\[ 400 - 200 = 200 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nSince the speed is halved for every 100 additional people, we calculate how many times the speed is halved when 200 additional people board the spaceship:\n\\[ \\frac{200}{100} = 2 \\text{ times} \\]\n\n halving the speed twice means we multiply the initial speed by \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\). Therefore, the speed of the spaceship when there are 400 people on board is:\n\\[ 500 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 125 \\text{ km per hour} \\]\n\nThus, the speed of the spaceship when there are 400 people on board is \\(\\boxed{125}\\).",

The difference in the number of people is:\n   \\[\n   400 - 200 = 200\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of 100-Person Groups:**\n   Since the speed is halved for every 100 additional people, we need to determine how many groups of 100 people are in the additional 200 people:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{200}{100} = 2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Halving the Speed:**\n   The speed is halved twice (once for each group of 100 people). Let's calculate the speed after each halving:\n   - After the first halving (100 additional people):\n     \\[\n     500 \\div 2 = 250 \\text{ km per hour}\n     \\]\n   - After the second halving (another 100 additional people):\n     \\[\n     250 \\div 2 = 125 \\text{ km per hour}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed of the spaceship when there are 400 people on board is \\boxed{125} km per hour.",
        "Let's start by analyzing the relationship between the number of people on board the spaceship and its speed. According to the problem, for every 100 additional people that board the spaceship, its speed is halved.\n\nWe are given that the speed of the spaceship with 200 people on board is 500 km per hour. We need to find the speed when there are 400 people on board. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Determine the increase in the number of people:\n   \\[\n   400 - 200 = 200\n   \\]\n   So, there are 200 more people on board than initially.\n\n2. Calculate how many sets of 100 people are in the increase:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{200}{100} = 2\n   \\]\n   This means that the speed will be halved twice.\n\n3. Apply the halving process twice to the initial speed:\n   - First halving:\n     \\[\n     500 \\div 2 = 250\n     \\]\n   - Second halving:\n     \\[\n     250 \\div 2 = 125\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed of the spaceship when there are 400 people on board is \\(\\boxed{125}\\) km per hour.",
        "To determine the speed of the spaceship when there are 400 people on board, we need to understand how the speed changes with the number of people. According to the problem, for every 100 additional people that board the spaceship, its speed is halved.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many additional people are on board when there are 400 people compared to 200 people:\n\\[ 400 - 200 = 200 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nSince the speed is halved for every 100 additional people, we need to determine how many times the speed is halved when 200 additional people board the spaceship:\n\\[ \\frac{200}{100} = 2 \\text{ times} \\]\n\nThis means the speed will be halved twice. Let's calculate the speed step by step:\n1. Start with the initial speed when there are 200 people on board, which is 500 km/hr.\n2. Halve the speed once: \n\\[ 500 \\div 2 = 250 \\text{ km/hr} \\]\n3. Halve the speed again:\n\\[ 250 \\div 2 = 125 \\text{ km/hr} \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed of the spaceship when there are 400 people on board is \\(\\boxed{125}\\) km/hr.",
