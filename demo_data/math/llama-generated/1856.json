Find out how many good firecrackers Jerry set off.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Jerry initially bought 48 firecrackers. The police officer confiscated 12 of them.\n   \\[\n   48 - 12 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, there are 36 firecrackers remaining.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining firecrackers are defective. According to the problem, 1/6 of the remaining firecrackers are defective.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{6} \\times 36 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, there are 6 defective firecrackers.\n\n3. To find the number of good firecrackers, we subtract the number of defective firecrackers from the total number of remaining firecrackers.\n   \\[\n   36 - 6 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, there are 30 good firecrackers.\n\n4. Finally, Jerry set off half of the good firecrackers.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 = 15\n   \\]\n   So, Jerry set off 15 firecrackers.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]",
