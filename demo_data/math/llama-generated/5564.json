        "To determine how much money Noemi began with, we need to account for all the money she lost and then add it to the amount of money she still has. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the total amount of money Noemi lost.\n2. Subtract the total amount lost from the amount of money she still has.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Noemi lost. She lost $400 on roulette and $500 on blackjack. Therefore, the total loss is:\n\\[\n400 + 500 = 900\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Noemi still has $800 in her purse. To find out how much money she began with, we add the total loss to the amount of money she still has:\n\\[\n800 + 900 = 1700\n\\]\n\nThus, Noemi began with \\(\\boxed{1700}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine how much money Noemi began with, we need to account for all the money she had initially, minus the money she lost, and then set that equal to the amount of money she has left.\n\nLet's denote the amount of money Noemi began with as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of money Noemi lost:\n\\[\n400 \\text{ (on roulette)} + 500 \\text{ (on blackjack)} = 900\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that after losing this total amount, Noemi still has $800 left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\nx - 900 = 800\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve for \\( x \\) by adding 900 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nx - 900 + 900 = 800 + 900\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 1700\n\\]\n\nThus, Noemi began with \\(\\boxed{1700}\\) dollars.",
