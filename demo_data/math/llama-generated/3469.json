        "To determine Kyle's age, we need to work step by step through the relationships given in the problem.\n\n1. **Determine Tyson's age:**\n   Tyson is given to be 20 years old.\n\n2. **Determine Frederick's age:**\n   Frederick is 2 times older than Tyson. Therefore, we calculate Frederick's age as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Frederick's age} = 2 \\times \\text{Tyson's age} = 2 \\times 20 = 40\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Julian's age:**\n   Julian is 20 years younger than Frederick. Therefore, we calculate Julian's age as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Julian's age} = \\text{Frederick's age} - 20 = 40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine Kyle's age:**\n   Kyle is 5 years older than Julian. Therefore, we calculate Kyle's age as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Kyle's age} = \\text{Julian's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25\n   \\]\n\nThus, Kyle is \\(\\boxed{25}\\) years old.",
