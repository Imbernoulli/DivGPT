        "To determine the total number of paintings Philip will have after 30 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of paintings Philip makes in 30 days:**\n   Philip makes 2 paintings per day. Therefore, over 30 days, the total number of paintings he makes is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ paintings/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 60 \\text{ paintings}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the paintings he already has to the paintings he makes:**\n   Philip already has 20 paintings. Adding the 60 paintings he makes over the 30 days gives:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ paintings} + 60 \\text{ paintings} = 80 \\text{ paintings}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of paintings Philip will have after 30 days is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
