        "To determine how many inches taller Grace's tower is than Clyde's, we first need to find the height of Clyde's tower. We know that Grace's tower is 8 times the size of Clyde's tower and that Grace's tower is 40 inches tall. Let's denote the height of Clyde's tower by \\( h \\). According to the problem, we have the equation:\n\n\\[ 8h = 40 \\]\n\nTo find \\( h \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{40}{8} = 5 \\]\n\nSo, Clyde's tower is 5 inches tall. Now, we need to find out how many inches taller Grace's tower is than Clyde's tower. We do this by subtracting the height of Clyde's tower from the height of Grace's tower:\n\n\\[ 40 - 5 = 35 \\]\n\nTherefore, Grace's tower is \\(\\boxed{35}\\) inches taller than Clyde's tower.",
