        "To determine how many people could not take the bus because it was full, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

Subtract the total number of people on the bus from the bus's carrying capacity to find out how many seats are left.\n4. Determine how many people could not take the bus because it was full.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The bus has a carrying capacity of 80 people. At the first pickup point, the number of people who entered the bus was \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of its carrying capacity.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of people who entered the bus} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 80 = \\frac{3 \\times 80}{5} = \\frac{240}{5} = 48\n   \\]\n\n2. After the first pickup, the total number of people on the bus is 48.\n\n3. At the next pickup point, there were 50 people who wanted to enter the bus. Since the bus can only carry 80 people and already has 48 people, the number of seats left is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Seats left} = 80 - 48 = 32\n   \\]\n   Since there are 50 people who want to enter and only 32 seats left, the number of people who could not take the bus is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{People who could not take the bus} = 50 - 32 = 18\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people who could not take the bus because it was full is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

Subtract the capacity of the bus from the total number of people to find out how many people could not take the bus.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of people who entered the bus at the first pickup point. The carrying capacity of the bus is 80 people, and the number of people who entered is \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the carrying capacity. So, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 80 = \\frac{3 \\times 80}{5} = \\frac{240}{5} = 48\n\\]\nThis means that 48 people entered the bus at the first pickup point.\n\nNext, we determine the total number of people on the bus after the first pickup. Since there were no people on the bus initially, the total number of people on the bus after the first pickup is:\n\\[\n48\n\\]\n\nAt the next pickup point, 50 people arrived. So, we add these 50 people to the 48 people already on the bus:\n\\[\n48 + 50 = 98\n\\]\n\nThe carrying capacity of the bus is 80 people. To find out how many people could not take the bus because it was full, we subtract the capacity of the bus from the total number of people:\n\\[\n98 - 80 = 18\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people who could not take the bus because it was full is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

Subtract the bus's carrying capacity from the total number of people on the bus to find out how many people could not take the bus.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The bus's carrying capacity is 80 people. At the first pickup point, the number of people who entered the bus was \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of its carrying capacity. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{5} \\times 80 = \\frac{3 \\times 80}{5} = \\frac{240}{5} = 48\n   \\]\n   Therefore, 48 people entered the bus at the first pickup point.\n\n2. At the second pickup point, 50 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus after the second pickup point is:\n   \\[\n   48 + 50 = 98\n   \\]\n\n3. The bus's carrying capacity is 80 people. To find out how many people could not take the bus because it was full, we subtract the bus's carrying capacity from the total number of people on the bus:\n   \\[\n   98 - 80 = 18\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people who could not take the bus because it was full is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

So, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 80 = \\frac{3 \\times 80}{5} = \\frac{240}{5} = 48\n\\]\nTherefore, 48 people entered the bus at the first pickup point.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of people the bus can still carry after the first pickup.**\n\nAfter 48 people enter the bus, the number of seats available left is:\n\\[\n80 - 48 = 32\n\\]\nSo, the bus can still carry 32 more people.\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many people could not take the bus because it was full at the next pickup point.**\n\nAt the next pickup point, there were 50 people. Since the bus can only carry 32 more people, the number of people who could not take the bus is:\n\\[\n50 - 32 = 18\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of people who could not take the bus because it was full is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

Find out how many people could not take the bus at the next pickup point because it was full.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of people who entered the bus at the first pickup point.**\n\nThe bus has a carrying capacity of 80 people. At the first pickup point, the number of people who entered the bus was \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of its carrying capacity.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of people who entered the bus} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 80 = \\frac{3 \\times 80}{5} = \\frac{240}{5} = 48\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of people the bus can still carry after the first pickup.**\n\nAfter 48 people enter the bus, the number of remaining seats is:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining seats} = 80 - 48 = 32\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many people could not take the bus at the next pickup point because it was full.**\n\nAt the next pickup point, there were 50 people. Since the bus only has 32 seats left, the number of people who could not take the bus is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of people who could not take the bus} = 50 - 32 = 18\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people who could not take the bus because it was full is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
        "To determine how many people could not take the bus because it was full, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of people who entered the bus at the first pickup point.\n2. Determine the total number of people on the bus after the first pickup point.\n3. Calculate how many people could not take the bus at the next pickup point because it was full.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of people who entered the bus at the first pickup point.**\n\nThe carrying capacity of the bus is 80 people. At the first pickup point, the number of people who entered the bus was \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of its carrying capacity. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 80 = \\frac{3 \\times 80}{5} = \\frac{240}{5} = 48\n\\]\nSo, 48 people entered the bus at the first pickup point.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of people on the bus after the first pickup point.**\n\nAfter the first pickup point, the bus has 48 people on it. At the next pickup point, 50 more people want to enter the bus. Therefore, we calculate the total number of people on the bus before it reaches its capacity:\n\\[\n48 + 50 = 98\n\\]\nHowever, the bus can only hold 80 people. So, the number of people who could not take the bus is:\n\\[\n98 - 80 = 18\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many people could not take the bus at the next pickup point because it was full.**\n\nThe number of people who could not take the bus because it was full is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

Calculate how many people could not take the bus because it was full after the second pickup point.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of people who entered the bus at the first pickup point. The bus has a carrying capacity of 80 people, and 3/5 of its carrying capacity entered the bus:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of people who entered at the first pickup point} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 80 = \\frac{3 \\times 80}{5} = \\frac{240}{5} = 48\n\\]\n\nSo, after the first pickup point, there are 48 people on the bus.\n\nNext, we determine the number of people on the bus after the second pickup point. There were 50 people at the second pickup point, but the bus can only hold 80 people. Since there are already 48 people on the bus, the bus can only take \\(80 - 48 = 32\\) more people. Therefore, the number of people who could not take the bus is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of people who could not take the bus} = 50 - 32 = 18\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people who could not take the bus because it was full is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
