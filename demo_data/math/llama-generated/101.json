        "To determine how many parking tickets Mark has, we start by defining the variables and using the information given in the problem.\n\nLet \\( p_S \\) be the number of parking tickets Sarah has, and \\( p_M \\) be the number of parking tickets Mark has.

Therefore, we can express \\( p_m \\) in terms of \\( p_s \\):\n\\[\np_m = 2p_s\n\\]\n\nSince the total number of parking tickets is 12, we can write the equation:\n\\[\np_s + p_m = 12\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( p_m = 2p_s \\) into the equation:\n\\[\np_s + 2p_s = 12\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\\[\n3p_s = 12\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( p_s \\):\n\\[\np_s = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Sarah has 4 parking tickets, we can find the number of parking tickets Mark has:\n\\[\np_m = 2p_s = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of parking tickets Mark has is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

Let \\( P_S \\) be the number of parking tickets Sarah has, and \\( P_M \\) be the number of parking tickets Mark has. Let \\( S_S \\) be the number of speeding tickets Sarah has, and \\( S_M \\) be the number of speeding tickets Mark has.\n\nAccording to the problem, Sarah has 6 speeding tickets, so we can write:\n\\[ S_S = 6 \\]\nSince Mark and Sarah have an equal number of speeding tickets, we also have:\n\\[ S_M = 6 \\]\n\nThe total number of traffic tickets between Mark and Sarah is 24. This total is the sum of their parking tickets and speeding tickets:\n\\[ P_S + P_M + S_S + S_M = 24 \\]\nSubstituting the known values of \\( S_S \\) and \\( S_M \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ P_S + P_M + 6 + 6 = 24 \\]\nSimplifying the left side, we have:\n\\[ P_S + P_M + 12 = 24 \\]\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we find:\n\\[ P_S + P_M = 12 \\]\n\nWe are also given that Mark has twice as many parking tickets as Sarah, so we can write:\n\\[ P_M = 2P_S \\]\n\nNow we substitute \\( P_M = 2P_S \\) into the equation \\( P_S + P_M = 12 \\):\n\\[ P_S + 2P_S = 12 \\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 3P_S = 12 \\]\nDividing both sides by 3, we find:\n\\[ P_S = 4 \\]\n\nSince \\( P_M = 2P_S \\), we can now calculate \\( P_M \\):\n\\[ P_M = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of parking tickets Mark has is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
        "To determine how many parking tickets Mark has, we start by defining the variables and using the given information.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( p_s \\) as the number of parking tickets Sarah has.\n- \\( p_m \\) as the number of parking tickets Mark has.\n- \\( s_s \\) as the number of speeding tickets Sarah has.\n- \\( s_m \\) as the number of speeding tickets Mark has.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. Mark has twice as many parking tickets as Sarah, so \\( p_m = 2p_s \\).\n2. They each have an equal number of speeding tickets, so \\( s_s = s_m \\).\n3. Sarah has 6 speeding tickets, so \\( s_s = 6 \\) and \\( s_m = 6 \\).\n4. The total number of traffic tickets between them is 24.\n\nThe total number of traffic tickets is the sum of all parking tickets and speeding tickets, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ p_s + p_m + s_s + s_m = 24 \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values into the equation, we get:\n\\[ p_s + 2p_s + 6 + 6 = 24 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we have:\n\\[ 3p_s + 12 = 24 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( p_s \\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3p_s = 12 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ p_s = 4 \\]\n\nSince \\( p_m = 2p_s \\), we substitute \\( p_s = 4 \\) into this equation:\n\\[ p_m = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of parking tickets Mark has is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."
