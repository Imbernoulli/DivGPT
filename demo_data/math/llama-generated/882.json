        "To determine how much more the largest frog weighs than the smallest frog, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the weight of the smallest frog:**\n   - We know the largest frog weighs 120 pounds and that it is 10 times as much as the smallest frog.\n   - Let \\( W_s \\) represent the weight of the smallest frog.\n   - Therefore, \\( 10 \\times W_s = 120 \\).\n   - To find \\( W_s \\), divide both sides of the equation by 10:\n     \\[\n     W_s = \\frac{120}{10} = 12 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the difference in weight between the largest and smallest frogs:**\n   - The largest frog weighs 120 pounds.\n   - The smallest frog weighs 12 pounds.\n   - The difference in weight is:\n     \\[\n     120 - 12 = 108 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the largest frog weighs \\(\\boxed{108}\\) pounds more than the smallest frog.",
        "To determine how much more the largest frog weighs than the smallest frog, we start by finding the weight of the smallest frog. According to the problem, the largest frog can grow to weigh 10 times as much as the smallest frog. We know that the largest frog weighs 120 pounds.\n\nLet's denote the weight of the smallest frog as \\( w \\). The relationship between the weights of the largest and smallest frogs can be expressed by the equation:\n\\[ 10w = 120 \\]\n\nTo find \\( w \\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 10:\n\\[ w = \\frac{120}{10} = 12 \\]\n\nSo, the smallest frog weighs 12 pounds. Now, we need to find out how much more the largest frog weighs than the smallest frog. We do this by subtracting the weight of the smallest frog from the weight of the largest frog:\n\\[ 120 - 12 = 108 \\]\n\nTherefore, the largest frog weighs \\(\\boxed{108}\\) pounds more than the smallest frog.",
