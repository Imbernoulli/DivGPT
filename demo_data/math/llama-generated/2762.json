        "To determine how much each person needs to contribute to the bill, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the meal after applying the coupon.\n2. Divide the total cost by the number of people to find out how much each person needs to contribute.\n\nFirst, we start with the total cost of the meal, which is $67. They have a coupon for $4, so we subtract the value of the coupon from the total cost:\n\\[ 67 - 4 = 63 \\]\nThis means the total cost of the meal after applying the coupon is $63.\n\nNext, we need to divide the total cost by the number of people, which is 3 (Sarah, Mary, and Tuan):\n\\[ 63 \\div 3 = 21 \\]\nSo, each person needs to contribute $21 to the bill.\n\nTherefore, the amount each person needs to contribute is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
