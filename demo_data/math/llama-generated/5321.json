        "To determine how long it will take Janet to get home, we need to calculate her net distance from the starting point after each segment of her walk and then find the total distance she has to cover.\n\n1. **First Segment:**\n   - Janet walks 3 blocks north.\n   - Net distance north: \\( 3 \\) blocks.\n\n2. **Second Segment:**\n   - Janet walks seven times as many blocks west.\n   - \\( 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\) blocks west.\n   - Net distance west: \\( 21 \\) blocks.\n\n3. **Third Segment:**\n   - Janet walks 8 blocks south.\n   - Net distance north: \\( 3 - 8 = -5 \\) blocks (or 5 blocks south).\n   - Net distance west: \\( 21 \\) blocks.\n\n4. **Fourth Segment:**\n   - Janet walks twice as many blocks east.\n   - \\( 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\) blocks east.\n   - Net distance west: \\( 21 - 16 = 5 \\) blocks (or 5 blocks east).\n   - Net distance north: \\( -5 \\) blocks (or 5 blocks south).\n\nNow, we have Janet's final position:\n- 5 blocks south\n- 5 blocks east\n\nTo get home, Janet needs to cover these net distances.

Since she walked 3 blocks north, she walks \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\) blocks west.\n   - Then she walks twice as many blocks east as she did south. Since she walked 8 blocks south, she walks \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) blocks east.\n   - Net displacement in the east-west direction: \\(-21 + 16 = -5\\) blocks (which means 5 blocks west).\n\nSo, Janet's net displacement from her starting point is 5 blocks south and 5 blocks west. To get home, she needs to walk 5 blocks north and 5 blocks east.\n\nThe total distance Janet needs to walk to get home is:\n\\[5 + 5 = 10 \\text{ blocks}\\]\n\nSince Janet walks at a speed of 2 blocks per minute, the time it will take her to get home is:\n\\[\\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ minutes}\\]\n\nTherefore, the time it will take Janet to get home is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

To get home, she needs to walk 5 blocks north and 5 blocks east.\n\n3. **Total Distance to Get Home:**\n   - Distance north: 5 blocks\n   - Distance east: 5 blocks\n   - Total distance: \\(5 + 5 = 10\\) blocks.\n\n4. **Time to Get Home:**\n   - Janet walks at a speed of 2 blocks per minute.\n   - Time required: \\(\\frac{10}{2} = 5\\) minutes.\n\nTherefore, it will take Janet \\(\\boxed{5}\\) minutes to get home.",
        "To determine how long it will take Janet to get home, we first need to calculate her net displacement in both the north-south and east-west directions.\n\n1.

Finally, she walks twice as many blocks east, which is \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) blocks east.\n\nNow, let's calculate her net displacement in the north-south direction:\n- She walks 3 blocks north and then 8 blocks south.\n- Her net displacement in the north-south direction is \\(3 - 8 = -5\\) blocks, which means she is 5 blocks south of her starting point.\n\nNext, let's calculate her net displacement in the east-west direction:\n- She walks 21 blocks west and then 16 blocks east.\n- Her net displacement in the east-west direction is \\(-21 + 16 = -5\\) blocks, which means she is 5 blocks west of her starting point.\n\nSo, Janet is 5 blocks south and 5 blocks west of her starting point. To get home, she needs to walk 5 blocks north and 5 blocks east, which totals \\(5 + 5 = 10\\) blocks.\n\nSince Janet can walk 2 blocks per minute, the time it will take her to walk 10 blocks is:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the time it will take Janet to get home is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) minutes.",

Since she walked 3 blocks north, she walks \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\) blocks west.\n\n   At this point, Janet's position relative to her starting point is 3 blocks north and 21 blocks west.\n\n2. **Return Movement:**\n   - Janet turns around and walks 8 blocks south.\n   - Then she walks twice as many blocks east. Since she walked 8 blocks south, she walks \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) blocks east.\n\n   After these movements, Janet's position relative to her starting point is \\(3 - 8 = -5\\) blocks north (or 5 blocks south) and \\(21 - 16 = 5\\) blocks west.\n\n3. **Net Displacement:**\n   - Janet is 5 blocks south and 5 blocks west of her starting point.
