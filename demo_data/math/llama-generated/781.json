        "To determine how many roommates John has, we start by identifying the number of roommates Bob has. According to the problem, Bob has 10 roommates.\n\nNext, we need to calculate twice the number of Bob's roommates:\n\\[ 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nJohn has five more roommates than this amount. Therefore, we add 5 to the result:\n\\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \\]\n\nThus, the number of roommates John has is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
