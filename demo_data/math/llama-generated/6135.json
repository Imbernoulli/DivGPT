It was Lorenzo's job, as head of quality control, to test every cork board for its ability to hold thumbtacks.  He placed one thumbtack from each of the three cans of thumbtacks into every board tested.  At the end of the day, he had tested 120 boards and had 30 tacks remaining in each of the three cans.

Determine the initial number of thumbtacks in each can.\n3. Calculate the total combined number of thumbtacks from the three cans.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of thumbtacks used.**\n\nLorenzo tested 120 boards, and for each board, he used one thumbtack from each of the three cans. Therefore, the total number of thumbtacks used is:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ boards} \\times 3 \\text{ thumbtacks per board} = 360 \\text{ thumbtacks} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the initial number of thumbtacks in each can.**\n\nAt the end of the day, Lorenzo had 30 thumbtacks remaining in each of the three cans. Let \\( x \\) be the initial number of thumbtacks in each can. The number of thumbtacks used from each can is:\n\\[ x - 30 \\]\n\nSince the total number of thumbtacks used from all three cans is 360, we can write:\n\\[ (x - 30) + (x - 30) + (x - 30) = 360 \\]\n\\[ 3(x - 30) = 360 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x - 30 = \\frac{360}{3} \\]\n\\[ x - 30 = 120 \\]\n\\[ x = 120 + 30 \\]\n\\[ x = 150 \\]\n\nSo, the initial number of thumbtacks in each can was 150.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total combined number of thumbtacks from the three full cans.**\n\nSince there are three cans, the total combined number of thumbtacks from the three full cans is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 150 = 450 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total combined number of thumbtacks from the three full cans is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{450}\n\\]",

Since there are three cans, the total combined number of thumbtacks from the three full cans is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 150 = 450\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total combined number of thumbtacks from the three full cans is \\(\\boxed{450}\\).",
