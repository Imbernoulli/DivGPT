        "To determine the number of roosters on the chicken farm, we start by defining the variables for the number of roosters and hens. Let's denote the number of roosters by \\( R \\) and the number of hens by \\( H \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the roosters outnumber the hens 2 to 1. This can be expressed as the ratio:\n\\[ R : H = 2 : 1 \\]\nThis ratio tells us that for every 2 roosters, there is 1 hen. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ R = 2H \\]\n\nWe also know the total number of chickens on the farm is 9,000. This means the sum of the number of roosters and the number of hens is 9,000:\n\\[ R + H = 9000 \\]\n\nNow we substitute the expression for \\( R \\) from the ratio into the total number equation:\n\\[ 2H + H = 9000 \\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[ 3H = 9000 \\]\n\nTo find the number of hens, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ H = \\frac{9000}{3} = 3000 \\]\n\nNow that we know there are 3,000 hens, we can find the number of roosters by substituting \\( H = 3000 \\) back into the expression \\( R = 2H \\):\n\\[ R = 2 \\times 3000 = 6000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of roosters on the chicken farm is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6000} \\]",
