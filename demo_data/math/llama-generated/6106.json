        "To determine how long it will take to fill the water tank to \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of its capacity, we first need to calculate the volume of water required to fill the tank to that level.\n\nThe total capacity of the tank is 4000 gallons. Therefore, \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the tank's capacity is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 4000 = 3000 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take to fill 3000 gallons with a pipe that fills the tank at a rate of 10 gallons per hour. We do this by dividing the volume of water needed by the rate at which the pipe fills the tank:\n\\[\n\\frac{3000 \\text{ gallons}}{10 \\text{ gallons per hour}} = 300 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take \\(\\boxed{300}\\) hours to fill the tank to \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of its capacity.",
        "To determine how long it will take to fill the water tank to 3/4 of its capacity, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the capacity of the tank when it is filled to 3/4.\n2. Determine the time required to fill the tank to that capacity given the rate of the pipe.\n\nFirst, we find the capacity of the tank when it is filled to 3/4. The total capacity of the tank is 4000 gallons. Therefore, 3/4 of the tank's capacity is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 4000 = 3000 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take to fill the tank with 3000 gallons of water, given that the pipe fills the tank at a rate of 10 gallons per hour. The time \\( t \\) required is calculated by dividing the volume of water needed by the rate of the pipe:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{3000 \\text{ gallons}}{10 \\text{ gallons per hour}} = 300 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take \\(\\boxed{300}\\) hours to fill the tank to 3/4 of its capacity."
