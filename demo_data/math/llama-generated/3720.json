        "To determine how much Marites will save per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps option over the 30 Mbps option, we need to calculate the annual cost for each option and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the annual cost of the 30 Mbps option:\n- The monthly cost of the 30 Mbps option is twice the current monthly bill.\n- The current monthly bill is $20.\n- Therefore, the monthly cost of the 30 Mbps option is \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) dollars.\n- The annual cost of the 30 Mbps option is \\(40 \\times 12 = 480\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the annual cost of the 20 Mbps option:\n- The monthly cost of the 20 Mbps option is $10 more than the current monthly bill.\n- The current monthly bill is $20.\n- Therefore, the monthly cost of the 20 Mbps option is \\(20 + 10 = 30\\) dollars.\n- The annual cost of the 20 Mbps option is \\(30 \\times 12 = 360\\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's find the difference in the annual costs between the 30 Mbps option and the 20 Mbps option:\n- The annual cost of the 30 Mbps option is $480.\n- The annual cost of the 20 Mbps option is $360.\n- The difference is \\(480 - 360 = 120\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, Marites will save \\(\\boxed{120}\\) dollars per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps option over the 30 Mbps option.",

Calculate the annual cost of the current 10 Mbps service.\n2. Calculate the annual cost of the 20 Mbps service.\n3. Calculate the annual cost of the 30 Mbps service.\n4. Find the difference in annual cost between the 20 Mbps service and the 30 Mbps service.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the annual cost of the current 10 Mbps service.**\n\nThe monthly bill for the current service is $20. Therefore, the annual cost is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 240 \\text{ dollars/year} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the annual cost of the 20 Mbps service.**\n\nThe price of the 20 Mbps service is $10 more than the current monthly bill. Therefore, the monthly cost is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ dollars} + 10 \\text{ dollars} = 30 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\nThe annual cost is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 360 \\text{ dollars/year} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the annual cost of the 30 Mbps service.**\n\nThe price of the 30 Mbps service is twice the amount of her current monthly bill. Therefore, the monthly cost is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 20 \\text{ dollars} = 40 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\nThe annual cost is:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 480 \\text{ dollars/year} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the difference in annual cost between the 20 Mbps service and the 30 Mbps service.**\n\nThe savings per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps service instead of the 30 Mbps service is:\n\\[ 480 \\text{ dollars/year} - 360 \\text{ dollars/year} = 120 \\text{ dollars/year} \\]\n\nTherefore, Marites will save \\(\\boxed{120}\\) dollars per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps service instead of the 30 Mbps service.",
        "To determine how much Marites will save per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps internet service over the 30 Mbps service, we need to calculate the annual cost of each service and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the annual cost of the current 10 Mbps service:\n\\[\n\\text{Monthly cost} = \\$20\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Annual cost} = \\$20 \\times 12 = \\$240\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the annual cost of the 20 Mbps service:\n\\[\n\\text{Monthly cost} = \\$20 + \\$10 = \\$30\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Annual cost} = \\$30 \\times 12 = \\$360\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the annual cost of the 30 Mbps service:\n\\[\n\\text{Monthly cost} = 2 \\times \\$20 = \\$40\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Annual cost} = \\$40 \\times 12 = \\$480\n\\]\n\nTo find out how much Marites will save per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps service over the 30 Mbps service, we subtract the annual cost of the 20 Mbps service from the annual cost of the 30 Mbps service:\n\\[\n\\text{Savings per year} = \\$480 - \\$360 = \\$120\n\\]\n\nThus, Marites will save \\(\\boxed{120}\\) dollars per year if she chooses the 20 Mbps service over the 30 Mbps service."
