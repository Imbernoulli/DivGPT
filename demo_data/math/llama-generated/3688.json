        "To determine how many notebooks Amanda has now, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of notebooks Amanda had.\n2. Add the number of notebooks she ordered.\n3. Subtract the number of notebooks she lost.\n\nLet's go through the steps in detail:\n\n1. Amanda initially had 10 notebooks.\n2. She ordered 6 more notebooks. So, we add 6 to the initial 10 notebooks:\n   \\[\n   10 + 6 = 16\n   \\]\n3. She lost 2 notebooks. So, we subtract 2 from the 16 notebooks:\n   \\[\n   16 - 2 = 14\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of notebooks Amanda has now is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
