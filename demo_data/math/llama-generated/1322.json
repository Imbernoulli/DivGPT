        "To determine how many new shirts Alex has, we need to work backwards from the information given about the number of shirts Ben, Joe, and Alex have.\n\n1. We know that Ben has 15 new shirts.\n2. Ben has eight more new shirts than Joe. Therefore, we can express the number of shirts Joe has as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of shirts Joe has} = \\text{Number of shirts Ben has} - 8 = 15 - 8 = 7\n   \\]\n3.
