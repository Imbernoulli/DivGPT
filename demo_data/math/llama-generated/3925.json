        "To determine the total distance Cheryl walked, we need to break down her journey into two parts: the distance she walked away from home and the distance she walked back home.\n\n1. First, we calculate the distance Cheryl walked away from home:\n   - Cheryl walked 2 miles per hour.\n   - She walked for 3 hours.\n   - Therefore, the distance she walked away from home is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n2. Next, we calculate the distance Cheryl walked back home:\n   - Since she walked back the same distance she walked away from home, the distance she walked back home is also 6 miles.\n\n3. To find the total distance Cheryl walked, we add the distance she walked away from home and the distance she walked back home:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ miles} + 6 \\text{ miles} = 12 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total distance Cheryl walked is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles.",
