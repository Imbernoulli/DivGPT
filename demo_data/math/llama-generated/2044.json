        "To determine how many peanuts Darma can eat in 6 minutes, we start by finding her rate of eating peanuts in peanuts per second. We know that Darma can eat 20 peanuts in 15 seconds. Therefore, her rate is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{20 \\text{ peanuts}}{15 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{4 \\text{ peanuts}}{3 \\text{ seconds}}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to convert 6 minutes into seconds, since the rate we found is in peanuts per second. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:\n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ minutes} = 6 \\times 60 \\text{ seconds} = 360 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we use the rate to find out how many peanuts Darma can eat in 360 seconds. Since she eats \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) peanuts per second, we multiply this rate by 360 seconds:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of peanuts} = \\left(\\frac{4 \\text{ peanuts}}{3 \\text{ seconds}}\\right) \\times 360 \\text{ seconds} = 4 \\times 120 = 480 \\text{ peanuts}\n\\]\n\nThus, Darma can eat \\(\\boxed{480}\\) peanuts in 6 minutes.",
