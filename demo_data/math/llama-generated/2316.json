        "To determine how many total slices of pizza were left over, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices initially.\n2. Determine how many slices each person ate.\n3. Subtract the total number of slices eaten from the initial total.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices initially:\n- Dean ordered 2 large pizzas.\n- Each pizza was cut into 12 slices.\n\\[\n2 \\text{ pizzas} \\times 12 \\text{ slices per pizza} = 24 \\text{ slices}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to know how many slices each person ate:\n- Dean ate half of the Hawaiian pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\text{ slices}\n\\]\n- Frank ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza.\n- Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4 \\text{ slices}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of slices eaten:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ slices (Dean)} + 3 \\text{ slices (Frank)} + 4 \\text{ slices (Sammy)} = 13 \\text{ slices}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the initial total:\n\\[\n24 \\text{ slices} - 13 \\text{ slices} = 11 \\text{ slices}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of slices left over is \\boxed{11}.",
