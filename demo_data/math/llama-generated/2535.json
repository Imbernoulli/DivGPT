        "To determine how many words Carl can type in 7 days, we need to break the problem down into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of words Carl types in one day:**\n   - Carl types at a speed of 50 words per minute.\n   - He types continuously for 4 hours per day.\n   - First, convert hours to minutes: \\( 4 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \\text{ minutes} \\).\n   - Now, calculate the total number of words typed in one day: \\( 50 \\text{ words/minute} \\times 240 \\text{ minutes} = 12000 \\text{ words} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of words Carl types in 7 days:**\n   - Carl types 12000 words per day.\n   - Over 7 days, the total number of words typed is: \\( 12000 \\text{ words/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 84000 \\text{ words} \\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of words Carl can type in 7 days is \\(\\boxed{84000}\\).",
