        "To determine the height of the camel in feet, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the height of the camel in inches.\n2. Convert the height from inches to feet.\n\nFirst, we know that the camel is 24 times taller than the hare. The height of the hare is 14 inches. Therefore, the height of the camel in inches is:\n\\[\n24 \\times 14\n\\]\n\nWe can calculate this product as follows:\n\\[\n24 \\times 14 = 24 \\times (10 + 4) = (24 \\times 10) + (24 \\times 4) = 240 + 96 = 336\n\\]\n\nSo, the height of the camel is 336 inches.\n\nNext, we need to convert the height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, we divide the height in inches by 12:\n\\[\n336 \\div 12\n\\]\n\nWe can perform the division as follows:\n\\[\n336 \\div 12 = 28\n\\]\n\nSo, the height of the camel in feet is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{28}\n\\]",
        "To determine the height of the camel in feet, we start by finding the height of the camel in inches. We know that the camel is 24 times taller than the hare, and the hare is 14 inches tall. Therefore, we can calculate the height of the camel as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height of the camel in inches} = 24 \\times 14\n\\]\n\nNext, we perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n24 \\times 14 = 336\n\\]\n\nSo, the camel is 336 inches tall. To convert this height from inches to feet, we use the fact that there are 12 inches in a foot. We divide the height in inches by 12:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height of the camel in feet} = \\frac{336}{12}\n\\]\n\nNow, we perform the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{336}{12} = 28\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the camel in feet is \\boxed{28}.",
