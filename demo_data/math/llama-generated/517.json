        "To determine how many ceilings Michelangelo will have left to paint after next week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of ceilings Michelangelo paints next week.\n2. Determine the total number of ceilings he paints over the two weeks.\n3. Subtract the total number of ceilings he paints from the original number of ceilings.\n\nFirst, we know that Michelangelo paints 12 ceilings this week. Next week, he will paint \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the number of ceilings he painted this week. So, we calculate the number of ceilings he paints next week as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3\n\\]\nTherefore, Michelangelo paints 3 ceilings next week.\n\nNext, we find the total number of ceilings he paints over the two weeks by adding the number of ceilings he painted this week and next week:\n\\[\n12 + 3 = 15\n\\]\nSo, Michelangelo paints a total of 15 ceilings over the two weeks.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of ceilings he paints from the original number of ceilings to find out how many ceilings are left to paint:\n\\[\n28 - 15 = 13\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of ceilings left to paint after next week is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",

Determine the total number of ceilings he paints over the two weeks.\n3. Subtract the total number of ceilings painted from the initial number of ceilings.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of ceilings Michelangelo paints next week. He paints \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the number of ceilings he painted this week. Since he painted 12 ceilings this week, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3\n\\]\nSo, Michelangelo will paint 3 ceilings next week.\n\nNext, we find the total number of ceilings Michelangelo paints over the two weeks. He paints 12 ceilings this week and 3 ceilings next week, so:\n\\[\n12 + 3 = 15\n\\]\nTherefore, Michelangelo paints a total of 15 ceilings over the two weeks.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of ceilings painted from the initial number of ceilings to find out how many ceilings are left to paint. Michelangelo started with 28 ceilings, so:\n\\[\n28 - 15 = 13\n\\]\nThus, the number of ceilings left to paint after next week is \\(\\boxed{13}\\)."
