Therefore, the bonus is:\n\\[\n0.50 \\times 1500 = 750\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the bonus to the base score to get the total score:\n\\[\n1500 + 750 = 2250\n\\]\n\nThus, Tom's total score is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2250}\n\\]",
        "To determine Tom's total score, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the base score:**\n   Tom gets 10 points for each enemy he kills.
