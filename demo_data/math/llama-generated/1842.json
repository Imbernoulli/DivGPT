        "To determine the total amount of money Chandler will pay for eight movie tickets and five football game tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of one football game ticket.\n2. Calculate the cost of eight movie tickets.\n3. Calculate the cost of five football game tickets.\n4. Add the cost of eight movie tickets and the cost of five football game tickets.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of one football game ticket. We know that eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket. Each movie ticket is sold at $30, so the cost of eight movie tickets is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 30 = 240 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nSince eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket, the cost of one football game ticket is:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{2} = 120 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of eight movie tickets. We already know that the cost of eight movie tickets is:\n\\[ 240 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the cost of five football game tickets. Since each football game ticket costs $120, the cost of five football game tickets is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 120 = 600 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the cost of eight movie tickets and the cost of five football game tickets to find the total amount of money Chandler will pay:\n\\[ 240 + 600 = 840 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Chandler will pay is:\n\\[ \\boxed{840} \\]",

Each movie ticket costs $30, so:\n\\[\n8 \\times 30 = 240\n\\]\nTherefore, the total cost of eight movie tickets is $240.\n\nNext, we know that eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket. Since eight movie tickets cost $240, we can find the cost of one football game ticket by dividing $240 by 2:\n\\[\n240 \\div 2 = 120\n\\]\nTherefore, the cost of one football game ticket is $120.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of five football game tickets. Since each football game ticket costs $120, we have:\n\\[\n5 \\times 120 = 600\n\\]\nTherefore, the total cost of five football game tickets is $600.\n\nFinally, we add the total cost of the movie tickets and the total cost of the football game tickets to find the total amount of money Chandler will pay:\n\\[\n240 + 600 = 840\n\\]\nTherefore, the total amount of money Chandler will pay is \\boxed{840}.",

Since each football game ticket is $120, we have:\n\\[ 5 \\times 120 = 600 \\]\nTherefore, the cost of five football game tickets is $600.\n\nFinally, we add the cost of eight movie tickets and the cost of five football game tickets to find the total amount of money Chandler will pay:\n\\[ 240 + 600 = 840 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Chandler will pay is \\(\\boxed{840}\\).",
        "To determine the total amount of money Chandler will pay for eight movie tickets and five football game tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the eight movie tickets.\n2. Determine the cost of one football game ticket.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the five football game tickets.\n4. Add the total cost of the movie tickets and the total cost of the football game tickets.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the eight movie tickets. Each movie ticket is sold at $30, so:\n\\[\n8 \\times 30 = 240\n\\]\nTherefore, the total cost of the eight movie tickets is $240.\n\nNext, we need to determine the cost of one football game ticket. We know that eight movie tickets cost 2 times as much as one football game ticket. Since the total cost of the eight movie tickets is $240, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n240 = 2 \\times \\text{cost of one football game ticket}\n\\]\nTo find the cost of one football game ticket, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{cost of one football game ticket} = \\frac{240}{2} = 120\n\\]\nTherefore, the cost of one football game ticket is $120.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of the five football game tickets. Since each football game ticket costs $120, we have:\n\\[\n5 \\times 120 = 600\n\\]\nTherefore, the total cost of the five football game tickets is $600.\n\nFinally, we add the total cost of the movie tickets and the total cost of the football game tickets to find the total amount of money Chandler will pay:\n\\[\n240 + 600 = 840\n\\]\nTherefore, the total amount of money Chandler will pay is \\boxed{840}.",
