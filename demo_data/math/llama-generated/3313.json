According to the problem, there were 4 times as many werewolves as vampires, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ w = 4v \\]\n\nVan Helsing removes half the vampires, so he removes \\( \\frac{v}{2} \\) vampires. He also removes 8 werewolves. The total amount of money he earns is given by:\n\\[ 5 \\left( \\frac{v}{2} \\right) + 10 \\times 8 = 105 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{5v}{2} + 80 = 105 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( v \\), we subtract 80 from both sides:\n\\[ \\frac{5v}{2} = 25 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:\n\\[ 5v = 50 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 5:\n\\[ v = 10 \\]\n\nNow that we know the number of vampires is 10, we can find the number of werewolves using the equation \\( w = 4v \\):\n\\[ w = 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\]\n\nVan Helsing removed 8 werewolves out of 40 werewolves. To find the percentage of werewolves he removed, we calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{8}{40} \\times 100\\% = 20\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of werewolves Van Helsing removed is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
