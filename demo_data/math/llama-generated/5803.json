Add the number of situps Diana did to the number of situps Hani did.\n\nFirst, we know that Diana did 40 situps at a rate of 4 situps per minute. We can verify this by dividing the total number of situps by the rate:\n\\[\n\\text{Time taken by Diana} = \\frac{40 \\text{ situps}}{4 \\text{ situps per minute}} = 10 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Hani said she would do 3 more situps per minute than Diana. Since Diana does 4 situps per minute, Hani does:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ situps per minute} + 3 \\text{ situps per minute} = 7 \\text{ situps per minute}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of situps Hani did in the same 10 minutes:\n\\[\n\\text{鐵ups done by Hani} = 7 \\text{ situps per minute} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} = 70 \\text{ situps}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of situps Diana did to the number of situps Hani did to get the total number of situps they did together:\n\\[\n\\text{Total situps} = 40 \\text{ situps} + 70 \\text{ situps} = 110 \\text{ situps}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of situps they did together is \\boxed{110}.",
        "To determine the total number of situps Hani and Diana did together, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of minutes Diana spent doing situps.\n2.

Add the number of situps Hani did to the number of situps Diana did.\n\nFirst, we know that Diana did 40 situps at a rate of 4 situps per minute. To find out how many minutes Diana spent doing situps, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total situps}}{\\text{Rate}} = \\frac{40}{4} = 10 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Hani said she would do 3 more situps per minute than Diana. Since Diana's situp rate is 4 situps per minute, Hani's situp rate is:\n\\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \\text{ situps per minute} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of situps Hani did. Since Hani did situps for the same amount of time as Diana (10 minutes), we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Total situps} = \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Time} = 7 \\times 10 = 70 \\text{ situps} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of situps Hani did to the number of situps Diana did to find the total number of situps they did together:\n\\[ 40 + 70 = 110 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of situps they did together is:\n\\[ \\boxed{110} \\]",
