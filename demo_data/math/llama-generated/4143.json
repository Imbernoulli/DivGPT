        "To determine how much Alice is short or above her goal, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the shoes and then compare it to her quota of $1000.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the revenue from selling each type of shoe:\n- Adidas: Alice sells 6 pairs of Adidas shoes, and each pair costs $45.\n  \\[\n  6 \\times 45 = 270\n  \\]\n  So, the revenue from Adidas shoes is $270.\n\n- Nike: Alice sells 8 pairs of Nike shoes, and each pair costs $60.\n  \\[\n  8 \\times 60 = 480\n  \\]\n  So, the revenue from Nike shoes is $480.\n\n- Reebok: Alice sells 9 pairs of Reebok shoes, and each pair costs $35.\n  \\[\n  9 \\times 35 = 315\n  \\]\n  So, the revenue from Reebok shoes is $315.\n\nNext, we sum the revenues from all types of shoes to find the total revenue:\n\\[\n270 + 480 + 315 = 1065\n\\]\nSo, the total revenue is $1065.\n\nNow, we compare the total revenue to Alice's quota:\n\\[\n1065 - 1000 = 65\n\\]\nSince the total revenue is $65 more than her quota, Alice is above her goal by $65.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{65}\n\\]",
