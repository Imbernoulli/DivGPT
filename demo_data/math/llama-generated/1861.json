However, soldiers in the second are each given 2 pounds less food than the first side.  If the first side has 4000 soldiers and the other side 500 soldiers fewer than the first side, what's the total amount of pounds of food both sides are eating altogether every day?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Calculate the total amount of food consumed by the soldiers on the second side.\n5. Add the two amounts together to get the total daily food consumption for both sides.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The first side has 4000 soldiers. The second side has 500 soldiers fewer than the first side.\n   \\[\n   4000 - 500 = 3500\n   \\]\n   So, the second side has 3500 soldiers.\n\n2.

Since the first side has 4000 soldiers, the number of soldiers on the second side is:\n\\[ 4000 - 500 = 3500 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the daily food consumption for the first side.
