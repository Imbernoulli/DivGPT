        "To determine the cost per serving of mixed nuts after applying the coupon, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the bag of mixed nuts after the coupon is applied.\n2. Determine the cost per ounce of mixed nuts.\n3. Calculate the cost per serving, which is 1 oz.\n\nFirst, we find the total cost of the bag of mixed nuts after the coupon is applied. The original cost of the bag is $25.00, and there is a $5.00 coupon:\n\n\\[ 25.00 - 5.00 = 20.00 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost of the bag after the coupon is $20.00.\n\nNext, we need to find the cost per ounce of mixed nuts. The bag contains 40 oz, so we divide the total cost by the number of ounces:\n\n\\[ 20.00 \\div 40 = 0.50 \\]\n\nThis means that each ounce of mixed nuts costs $0.50. Since we need the cost per serving and each serving is 1 oz, the cost per serving is $0.50.\n\nTo convert this cost to cents, we multiply by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar):\n\n\\[ 0.50 \\times 100 = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost per serving of nuts, in cents, after the coupon is applied is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
