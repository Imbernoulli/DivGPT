        "To determine how long it takes James to run 100 meters, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find out John's top speed. John runs 100 meters in 13 seconds, and he only goes 4 meters in the first second. Therefore, the distance he covers in the remaining 12 seconds is:\n\\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \\text{ meters} \\]\nSince he maintains the same speed for the rest of the race, his top speed is:\n\\[ \\frac{96 \\text{ meters}}{12 \\text{ seconds}} = 8 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nJames is 2 m/s faster than John at the top speed, so his top speed is:\n\\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nNext, we know that James can run the first 10 meters in 2 seconds. Therefore, the distance he has left to run is:\n\\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \\text{ meters} \\]\nSince he runs at a top speed of 10 m/s for the remaining distance, the time it takes him to run the remaining 90 meters is:\n\\[ \\frac{90 \\text{ meters}}{10 \\text{ m/s}} = 9 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nAdding the time it takes James to run the first 10 meters to the time it takes him to run the remaining 90 meters, we get:\n\\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes James \\(\\boxed{11}\\) seconds to run 100 meters.",

        "To determine how long it takes James to run 100 meters, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate John's top speed\nJohn runs 100 meters in 13 seconds and covers 4 meters in the first second. Therefore, the distance he covers in the remaining time is:\n\\[\n100 \\text{ meters} - 4 \\text{ meters} = 96 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\nThe time he takes to cover these 96 meters is:\n\\[\n13 \\text{ seconds} - 1 \\text{ second} = 12 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\nJohn's top speed is:\n\\[\n\\frac{96 \\text{ meters}}{12 \\text{ seconds}} = 8 \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine James's top speed\nJames is 2 m/s faster than John. Therefore, his top speed is:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ m/s} + 2 \\text{ m/s} = 10 \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the time James takes to run the first 10 meters\nJames runs the first 10 meters in 2 seconds.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance James needs to run\nThe total distance James needs to run is 100 meters. After running the first 10 meters, the remaining distance is:\n\\[\n100 \\text{ meters} - 10 \\text{ meters} = 90 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the time James takes to run the remaining distance\nSince James's top speed is 10 m/s, the time he takes to run the remaining 90 meters is:\n\\[\n\\frac{90 \\text{ meters}}{10 \\text{ m/s}} = 9 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the total time James takes to run 100 meters\nThe total time James takes is the sum of the time he takes for the first 10 meters and the time he takes for the remaining 90 meters:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ seconds} + 9 \\text{ seconds} = 11 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the time it takes James to run 100 meters is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]",
        "To determine how long it takes James to run 100 meters, we need to analyze his running speed and the time he spends at different intervals.\n\nFirst, let's find John's top speed. John runs 100 meters in 13 seconds, and he covers 4 meters in the first second. Therefore, the distance he covers in the remaining 12 seconds is:\n\\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \\text{ meters} \\]\nSince he maintains the same speed for the rest of the race, his top speed is:\n\\[ \\frac{96 \\text{ meters}}{12 \\text{ seconds}} = 8 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nJames is 2 m/s faster than John at his top speed, so his top speed is:\n\\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how long it takes James to run the first 10 meters. According to the problem, James can run the first 10 meters in 2 seconds.\n\nAfter running the first 10 meters, James has \\( 100 - 10 = 90 \\) meters left to run. Since he runs at a top speed of 10 m/s, the time it takes him to run the remaining 90 meters is:\n\\[ \\frac{90 \\text{ meters}}{10 \\text{ m/s}} = 9 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nAdding the time it takes James to run the first 10 meters to the time it takes him to run the remaining 90 meters, we get:\n\\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes James to run 100 meters is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]",
        "To determine how long it takes James to run 100 meters, we need to break down the problem into three parts: the time it takes James to run the first 10 meters, the time it takes him to run the next 90 meters at his top speed, and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, we calculate John's top speed. John runs 100 meters in 13 seconds, and he only goes 4 meters in the first second.

According to the problem, it takes James 2 seconds to run the first 10 meters.\n\nThen, we calculate the time it takes James to run the remaining 90 meters at his top speed. Since his top speed is 10 m/s, the time it takes him to run 90 meters is:\n\\[ \\frac{90 \\text{ meters}}{10 \\text{ m/s}} = 9 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the time it takes James to run the first 10 meters and the time it takes him to run the remaining 90 meters:\n\\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes James \\(\\boxed{11}\\) seconds to run 100 meters.",
