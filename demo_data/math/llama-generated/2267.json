        "To determine the total number of t-shirts Dan makes over the course of two hours, we need to calculate the number of t-shirts he makes in each hour separately and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of t-shirts Dan makes in the first hour. Since he makes one t-shirt every 12 minutes, we can find the number of t-shirts he makes in one hour by dividing 60 minutes (the number of minutes in an hour) by 12 minutes per t-shirt:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{12} = 5\n\\]\nSo, Dan makes 5 t-shirts in the first hour.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of t-shirts Dan makes in the second hour. Since he makes one t-shirt every 6 minutes, we can find the number of t-shirts he makes in one hour by dividing 60 minutes (the number of minutes in an hour) by 6 minutes per t-shirt:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{6} = 10\n\\]\nSo, Dan makes 10 t-shirts in the second hour.\n\nNow, we add the number of t-shirts he makes in the first hour to the number of t-shirts he makes in the second hour to find the total number of t-shirts he makes over the two hours:\n\\[\n5 + 10 = 15\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of t-shirts Dan makes over the course of those two hours is \\boxed{15}.",
