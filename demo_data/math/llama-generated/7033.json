Calculate the cost of the toy cars:\n   Sarah buys 2 toy cars, each costing $11.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 11 = 22\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the toy cars is $22.\n\n2. Add the cost of the scarf:\n   Sarah buys a scarf for $10.\n   \\[\n   22 + 10 = 32\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost so far is $32.\n\n3. Add the cost of the beanie:\n   Sarah buys a beanie for $14.\n   \\[\n   32 + 14 = 46\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of all the items is $46.\n\n4. Add the remaining money:\n   After buying the beanie, Sarah has $7 remaining.\n   \\[\n   46 + 7 = 53\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount of money Sarah started with is $53.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{53}\\).",
