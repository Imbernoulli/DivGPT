Determine the total sales from the customers who do not return their books.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of customers who return their books. Since 37% of her 1000 customers return their books, we can find this number by multiplying 1000 by 37%.\n\n\\[ 1000 \\times 0.37 = 370 \\]\n\nSo, 370 customers return their books.
