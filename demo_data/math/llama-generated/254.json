        "To determine how much Mark can bench press, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much Dave can bench press.\n2. Determine how much Craig can bench press.\n3. Find out how much Mark can bench press.\n\nFirst, we calculate how much Dave can bench press. Dave weighs 175 pounds and can bench press three times his body weight:\n\\[\n175 \\times 3 = 525 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\nSo, Dave can bench press 525 pounds.\n\nNext, we determine how much Craig can bench press. Craig can bench press 20% of the amount Dave can. We calculate 20% of 525 pounds:\n\\[\n525 \\times 0.20 = 105 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\nSo, Craig can bench press 105 pounds.\n\nFinally, we find out how much Mark can bench press. Mark can bench press 50 pounds less than Craig. We subtract 50 pounds from 105 pounds:\n\\[\n105 - 50 = 55 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\nSo, Mark can bench press 55 pounds.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{55}\n\\]",

Therefore, we multiply Dave's weight by 3:\n\\[\n175 \\times 3 = 525\n\\]\nSo, Dave can bench press 525 pounds.\n\nNext, we determine how much Craig can bench press. Craig can bench press 20% of the amount Dave can. To find 20% of 525, we multiply 525 by 0.20:\n\\[\n525 \\times 0.20 = 105\n\\]\nSo, Craig can bench press 105 pounds.\n\nFinally, we find out how much Mark can bench press. Mark can bench press 50 pounds less than Craig. Therefore, we subtract 50 from 105:\n\\[\n105 - 50 = 55\n\\]\nSo, Mark can bench press \\boxed{55} pounds.",
