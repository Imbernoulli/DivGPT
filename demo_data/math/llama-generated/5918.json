To find out how many 2-week periods she needs to earn $1800, we divide $1800 by $600.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of 2-week periods} = \\frac{1800 \\text{ dollars}}{600 \\text{ dollars/2 weeks}} = 3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the number of 2-week periods into weeks:**\n   Since each 2-week period is equivalent to 2 weeks, we multiply the number of 2-week periods by 2.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of weeks} = 3 \\text{ periods} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks/period} = 6 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Grace \\boxed{6} weeks to get $1800.",
        "To determine how many weeks it will take for Grace to get $1800, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much Grace earns in 2 weeks.\n2. Determine how many 2-week periods are needed to reach $1800.\n3. Convert the number of 2-week periods back into weeks.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate how much Grace earns in 2 weeks.**\n\nGrace earns $300 each week. Therefore, in 2 weeks, she earns:\n\\[ 300 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 600 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many 2-week periods are needed to reach $1800.**\n\nTo find out how many 2-week periods are needed to earn $1800, we divide $1800 by the amount she earns in 2 weeks:\n\\[ 1800 \\text{ dollars} \\div 600 \\text{ dollars/2 weeks} = 3 \\text{ periods} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert the number of 2-week periods back into weeks.**\n\nSince each period is 2 weeks, we multiply the number of periods by 2 to find the total number of weeks:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ periods} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks/period} = 6 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Grace \\(\\boxed{6}\\) weeks to get $1800.",
        "To determine how many weeks it will take for Grace to get $1800, we start by calculating her weekly earnings and then consider the payment schedule.\n\n1. Grace earns $300 each week.\n2. Since her client pays her every 2 weeks, we need to find out how much she earns in 2 weeks.\n   \\[\n   300 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 600 \\text{ dollars every 2 weeks}\n   \\]\n\n3.
