        "To determine the total kilograms of potatoes sold in the shop for the whole day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bags of potatoes sold in the morning and the afternoon.\n2. Multiply the total number of bags by the weight of each bag.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of bags sold in the day:\n\\[ \\text{Total bags sold} = \\text{Bags sold in the morning} + \\text{Bags sold in the afternoon} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total bags sold} = 29 + 17 = 46 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out the total weight of these 46 bags. Since each bag weighs 7 kg, we multiply the total number of bags by the weight of each bag:\n\\[ \\text{Total weight} = \\text{Total bags sold} \\times \\text{Weight of each bag} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total weight} = 46 \\times 7 = 322 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total kilograms of potatoes sold for the whole day is:\n\\[ \\boxed{322} \\]",
