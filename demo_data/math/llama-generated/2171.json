They then spent the next 4 hours pumping milk at a rate of 2,880 gallons/hour from the storage tank into a milk tanker. For the next 7 hours, the workers added more milk into the storage tank, at a rate of 1,500 gallons per hour. How many gallons of milk were left in the storage tank?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Subtract the amount of milk pumped out from the initial amount of milk and then add the amount of milk added.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of milk pumped out of the storage tank. The workers pumped milk at a rate of 2,880 gallons per hour for 4 hours:\n\\[\n2,880 \\text{ gallons/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 11,520 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\nSo, 11,520 gallons of milk were pumped out of the storage tank.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of milk added to the storage tank. The workers added milk at a rate of 1,500 gallons per hour for 7 hours:\n\\[\n1,500 \\text{ gallons/hour} \\times 7 \\text{ hours} = 10,500 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\nSo, 10,500 gallons of milk were added to the storage tank.\n\nNow, we start with the initial amount of milk in the storage tank, which is 30,000 gallons. We subtract the amount of milk pumped out and then add the amount of milk added:\n\\[\n30,000 \\text{ gallons} - 11,520 \\text{ gallons} + 10,500 \\text{ gallons} = 28,980 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of gallons of milk left in the storage tank is \\boxed{28980}.",
        "To determine how many gallons of milk were left in the storage tank, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of milk pumped out of the storage tank.\n2. Calculate the total amount of milk added to the storage tank.\n3. Determine the net change in the amount of milk in the storage tank.\n4. Calculate the final amount of milk in the storage tank.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of milk pumped out of the storage tank.**\n\nThe workers pumped milk at a rate of 2,880 gallons per hour for 4 hours.\n\\[\n2,880 \\text{ gallons/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 11,520 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\nSo, 11,520 gallons of milk were pumped out of the storage tank.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of milk added to the storage tank.**\n\nThe workers added milk at a rate of 1,500 gallons per hour for 7 hours.\n\\[\n1,500 \\text{ gallons/hour} \\times 7 \\text{ hours} = 10,500 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\nSo, 10,500 gallons of milk were added to the storage tank.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the net change in the amount of milk in the storage tank.**\n\nThe initial amount of milk in the storage tank was 30,000 gallons. After pumping out 11,520 gallons and adding 10,500 gallons, the net change in the amount of milk is:\n\\[\n30,000 \\text{ gallons} - 11,520 \\text{ gallons} + 10,500 \\text{ gallons} = 28,980 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final amount of milk in the storage tank.**\n\nThe final amount of milk in the storage tank is 28,980 gallons.\n\nThus, the number of gallons of milk left in the storage tank is \\boxed{28980}.",
        "To determine how many gallons of milk were left in the storage tank, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the changes in the amount of milk step by step.\n\n1. **Initial amount of milk collected:**\n   The workers collected 30,000 gallons of milk and pimped it into the storage tank.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial milk} = 30,000 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Milk pumped out:**\n   The workers spent the next 4 hours pumping milk out of the storage tank at a rate of 2,880 gallons per hour.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Milk pumped out} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\times 2,880 \\text{ gallons/hour} = 11,520 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   Subtract the amount of milk pumped out from the initial amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Milk after pumping out} = 30,000 \\text{ gallons} - 11,520 \\text{ gallons} = 18,480 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Milk added:**\n   For the next 7 hours, the workers added more milk into the storage tank at a rate of 1,500 gallons per hour.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Milk added} = 7 \\text{ hours} \\times 1,500 \\text{ gallons/hour} = 10,500 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   Add the amount of milk added to the amount of milk after pumping out:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Milk after adding} = 18,480 \\text{ gallons} + 10,500 \\text{ gallons} = 28,980 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of gallons of milk left in the storage tank is \\(\\boxed{28980}\\)."
