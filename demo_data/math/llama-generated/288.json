        "To determine how many dogs Heloise remains with after giving 10 dogs to her friend Janet, we start by finding out how many dogs and cats she initially has.\n\nThe ratio of dogs to cats is given as 10:17. This means that for every 10 dogs, there are 17 cats. The total number of pets is 189. Let's denote the number of dogs by \\(10x\\) and the number of cats by \\(17x\\). According to the problem, the total number of pets is the sum of the dogs and cats:\n\n\\[10x + 17x = 189\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[27x = 189\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\(x\\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{189}{27} = 7\\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\(x\\), we can find the initial number of dogs and cats. The number of dogs is:\n\n\\[10x = 10 \\times 7 = 70\\]\n\nThe number of cats is:\n\n\\[17x = 17 \\times 7 = 119\\]\n\nHeloise gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet. Therefore, the number of dogs she has left is:\n\n\\[70 - 10 = 60\\]\n\nThus, the number of dogs Heloise remains with is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{60}\\]",
