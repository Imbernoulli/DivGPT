They like apples, blueberries, and bonnies. The first dog, which likes apples, eats 3 times as many apples as the number of blueberries eaten by the second dog that likes blueberries. The dog that likes blueberries eats 3/4 times as many blueberries as the number of bonnies eaten by the third dog.

        "To determine the total number of fruits eaten by the three dogs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of bonnies eaten by the third dog.\n2. Calculate the number of blueberries eaten by the second dog.\n3. Calculate the number of apples eaten by the first dog.\n4. Sum the total number of fruits eaten by all three dogs.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- The third dog likes bonnies and ate 60 of them.\n\nSince the dog that likes blueberries eats \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) times as many blueberries as the number of bonnies eaten by the third dog, we can calculate the number of blueberries eaten by the second dog as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blueberries eaten by the second dog} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 60 = 45\n\\]\n\nNext, the first dog eats 3 times as many apples as the number of blueberries eaten by the second dog. Therefore, we can calculate the number of apples eaten by the first dog as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of apples eaten by the first dog} = 3 \\times 45 = 135\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the total number of fruits eaten by all three dogs:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of fruits eaten} = \\text{Number of apples eaten by the first dog} + \\text{Number of blueberries eaten by the second dog} + \\text{Number of bonnies eaten by the third dog} = 135 + 45 + 60 = 240\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of fruits eaten by the three dogs is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of fruits eaten by the three dogs, we need to calculate the number of each type of fruit eaten by each dog step by step.\n\nFirst, we know the third dog likes bonnies and ate 60 of them. Let's denote the number of bonnies eaten by the third dog as \\( B_3 \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ B_3 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we know that the dog that likes blueberries eats \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) times as many blueberries as the number of bonnies eaten by the third dog. Let's denote the number of blueberries eaten by the second dog as \\( B_2 \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ B_2 = \\frac{3}{4} \\times B_3 = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 60 = 45 \\]\n\nThen, we know that the first dog eats 3 times as many apples as the number of blueberries eaten by the second dog. Let's denote the number of apples eaten by the first dog as \\( A_1 \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ A_1 = 3 \\times B_2 = 3 \\times 45 = 135 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of fruits eaten by the three dogs. The first dog eats 135 apples, the second dog eats 45 blueberries, and the third dog eats 60 bonnies. Therefore, the total number of fruits eaten is:\n\\[ A_1 + B_2 + B_3 = 135 + 45 + 60 = 240 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of fruits eaten by the three dogs is:\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]",

The second dog eats \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) times as many blueberries as the number of bonnies eaten by the third dog.\n3. The third dog ate 60 bonnies.\n\nFrom the third piece of information, we have:\n\\[ C = 60 \\]\n\nUsing the second piece of information, we can express the number of blueberries eaten by the second dog in terms of the number of bonnies eaten by the third dog:\n\\[ B = \\frac{3}{4}C \\]\nSubstituting \\( C = 60 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ B = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 60 = 45 \\]\n\nUsing the first piece of information, we can express the number of apples eaten by the first dog in terms of the number of blueberries eaten by the second dog:\n\\[ A = 3B \\]\nSubstituting \\( B = 45 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ A = 3 \\times 45 = 135 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of fruits eaten by the three dogs. The first dog eats apples, the second dog eats blueberries, and the third dog eats bonnies. Therefore, the total number of fruits eaten is:\n\\[ A + B + C = 135 + 45 + 60 = 240 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of fruits eaten by the three dogs is:\n\\[ \\boxed{240} \\]",
