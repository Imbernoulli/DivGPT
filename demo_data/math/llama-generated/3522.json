        "To determine the total number of stamps Bert has after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of stamps Bert had before the purchase.\n2. Add the number of stamps he bought to the number of stamps he had before the purchase.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of stamps Bert had before the purchase as \\( x \\). According to the problem, before the purchase, Bert had only half the stamps he bought. Since he bought 300 stamps, we can write the equation:\n\\[ x = \\frac{300}{2} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[ x = 150 \\]\n\nSo, Bert had 150 stamps before the purchase. Now, we add the 300 stamps he bought to the 150 stamps he already had:\n\\[ 150 + 300 = 450 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of stamps Bert has after the purchase is \\(\\boxed{450}\\).",
