Since each bottle holds 2 cups of water, we can calculate the total water she drank as follows:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ hours} \\times 2 \\text{ cups/hour} = 16 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of water Ginger poured over the plants. She poured an additional 5 bottles of water over the plants. Since each bottle holds 2 cups of water, we can calculate the total water she poured over the plants as follows:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ bottles} \\times 2 \\text{ cups/bottle} = 10 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNow, we add the amount of water she drank to the amount of water she poured over the plants to find the total amount of water she used:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ cups} + 10 \\text{ cups} = 26 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water Ginger drank and used that day is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).",
