        "To determine how many baseball trading cards Keith started with, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the number of cards Keith started with.\n2.

        "To determine how many baseball trading cards Keith started with, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the variable:**\n   Let \\( x \\) be the number of cards Keith started with.\n\n2. **Add the new cards:**\n   Keith bought 8 new cards, so the total number of cards after buying them is \\( x + 8 \\).\n\n3. **Account for the cards eaten by the dog:**\n   The dog ate half of his collection. Therefore, the number of cards left after the dog ate half is \\( \\frac{x + 8}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Set up the equation:**\n   We know that after the dog ate half of the collection, Keith has 46 cards left. So, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x + 8}{2} = 46\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - First, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n     \\[\n     x + 8 = 46 \\times 2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x + 8 = 92\n     \\]\n   - Next, subtract 8 from both sides to isolate \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 92 - 8\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 84\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Keith started with \\(\\boxed{84}\\) cards.",
