        "To determine how much ribbon remains after cutting 100 pieces, each 15 centimeters long, from a 51-meter long ribbon, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the length of the ribbon from meters to centimeters. Since there are 100 centimeters in a meter, we multiply 51 by 100:\n   \\[\n   51 \\text{ meters} = 51 \\times 100 = 5100 \\text{ centimeters}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the total length of the 100 pieces of ribbon that are cut. Each piece is 15 centimeters long, so we multiply 100 by 15:\n   \\[\n   100 \\text{ pieces} \\times 15 \\text{ centimeters/piece} = 1500 \\text{ centimeters}\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract the total length of the cut pieces from the original length of the ribbon to find out how much ribbon remains:\n   \\[\n   5100 \\text{ centimeters} - 1500 \\text{ centimeters} = 3600 \\text{ centimeters}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the remaining ribbon is \\(\\boxed{3600}\\) centimeters.",

Therefore, the length of the ribbon that remains is:\n\\[ 5100 - 1500 = 3600 \\text{ centimeters} \\]\n\nTo express the remaining length in meters, we convert 3600 centimeters back to meters by dividing by 100:\n\\[ 3600 \\text{ centimeters} = 3600 \\div 100 = 36 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThus, the length of the ribbon that remains is \\(\\boxed{36}\\) meters.",
