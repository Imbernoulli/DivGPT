        "To determine the total number of bulbs needed, we need to calculate the number of each type of ceiling light and then sum the bulbs required for each type.\n\n1. Identify the number of medium ceiling lights:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of medium ceiling lights} = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of large ceiling lights. According to the problem, there are twice as many large ceiling lights as medium ceiling lights:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of large ceiling lights} = 2 \\times 12 = 24\n   \\]\n\n3.

Determine the total number of bulbs needed. Each small ceiling light requires 1 bulb, each medium ceiling light requires 2 bulbs, and each large ceiling light requires 3 bulbs:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of bulbs} = (\\text{Number of small ceiling lights} \\times 1) + (\\text{Number of medium ceiling lights} \\times 2) + (\\text{Number of large ceiling lights} \\times 3)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we found:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of bulbs} = (22 \\times 1) + (12 \\times 2) + (24 \\times 3)\n   \\]\n   Calculate each term:\n   \\[\n   22 \\times 1 = 22\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 2 = 24\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   24 \\times 3 = 72\n   \\]\n   Add these values together:\n   \\[\n   22 + 24 + 72 = 118\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of bulbs needed is \\(\\boxed{118}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of bulbs needed, we first need to find out how many small, medium, and large ceiling lights there are in the house. We know the following:\n\n1. The house has 12 medium ceiling lights.\n2. There are twice as many large ceiling lights as medium ceiling lights.\n3. There are ten more small ceiling lights than medium ceiling lights.\n\nLet's calculate the number of large ceiling lights:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of large ceiling lights} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of medium ceiling lights} = 2 \\times 12 = 24\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of small ceiling lights:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of small ceiling lights} = \\text{Number of medium ceiling lights} + 10 = 12 + 10 = 22\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the total number of bulbs required for each type of ceiling light:\n- Each small ceiling light requires 1 bulb, so the total number of bulbs for small ceiling lights is:\n\\[\n\\text{Bulbs for small ceiling lights} = 22 \\times 1 = 22\n\\]\n- Each medium ceiling light requires 2 bulbs, so the total number of bulbs for medium ceiling lights is:\n\\[\n\\text{Bulbs for medium ceiling lights} = 12 \\times 2 = 24\n\\]\n- Each large ceiling light requires 3 bulbs, so the total number of bulbs for large ceiling lights is:\n\\[\n\\text{Bulbs for large ceiling lights} = 24 \\times 3 = 72\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add up the bulbs needed for all the ceiling lights:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of bulbs} = \\text{Bulbs for small ceiling lights} + \\text{Bulbs for medium ceiling lights} + \\text{Bulbs for large ceiling lights} = 22 + 24 + 72 = 118\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of bulbs you should buy is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{118}\n\\]",

Therefore, the number of large ceiling lights is \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\).\n- The number of small ceiling lights is ten more than the number of medium ceiling lights. Therefore, the number of small ceiling lights is \\(12 + 10 = 22\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of bulbs required for each type of ceiling light:\n- Each small ceiling light requires 1 bulb. Therefore, the total number of bulbs for small ceiling lights is \\(22 \\times 1 = 22\\).\n- Each medium ceiling light requires 2 bulbs. Therefore, the total number of bulbs for medium ceiling lights is \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\).\n- Each large ceiling light requires 3 bulbs.
