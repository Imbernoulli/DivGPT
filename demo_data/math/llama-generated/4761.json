        "To determine how much Jennie paid for renting a car for 11 days, we need to consider the pricing structure provided by the car-rental agency. The agency offers two pricing options: $30 per day or $190 for the first week for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer.\n\nFirst, let's break down the rental period into two parts: the first week and the remaining days.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost for the first week:**\n   - The first week consists of 7 days.\n   - The agency charges $190 for the first week.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost for the remaining days:**\n   - Jennie rented the car for a total of 11 days.\n   - After the first week, the number of remaining days is \\( 11 - 7 = 4 \\) days.\n   - The agency charges $30 per day for the remaining days.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for the remaining days:**\n   - The cost for 4 days is \\( 4 \\times 30 = 120 \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost for the entire rental period:**\n   - Add the cost for the first week to the cost for the remaining days:\n     \\[\n     190 + 120 = 310\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Jennie paid \\(\\boxed{310}\\) dollars for the rental.",

The agency offers two pricing options:\n\n1. $30 per day for a car.\n2. $190 for the first week (7 days) for a rental that lasts an entire week or longer.\n\nSince Jennie rented the car for 11 days, which is more than a week, she qualifies for the discounted rate of $190 for the first week. After the first week, she has rented the car for an additional 4 days (11 days - 7 days = 4 days).\n\nThe cost for the first week is $190. The cost for the remaining 4 days is calculated at the daily rate of $30 per day:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ days} \\times \\$30/\\text{day} = \\$120. \\]\n\nTo find the total cost, we add the cost of the first week to the cost of the remaining 4 days:\n\\[ \\$190 + \\$120 = \\$310. \\]\n\nTherefore, Jennie paid \\(\\boxed{310}\\) dollars for the rental.",
        "To determine how much Jennie paid for renting the car for 11 days, we need to consider the pricing structure of the car-rental agency. The agency charges $30 per day or $190 for the first week if the rental lasts an entire week or longer.\n\nFirst, let's break down the rental period into two parts: the first week and the remaining days.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost for the first week:**\n   - The rental lasts for 11 days.\n   - The first week consists of 7 days.\n   - The cost for the first week is $190.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost for the remaining days:**\n   - After the first week, Jennie has \\( 11 - 7 = 4 \\) days left.\n   - The cost per day for these remaining days is $30.\n   - The total cost for the remaining 4 days is \\( 4 \\times 30 = 120 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Add the costs for the first week and the remaining days:**\n   - The total cost is \\( 190 + 120 = 310 \\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, Jennie paid \\(\\boxed{310}\\) dollars for the rental."
