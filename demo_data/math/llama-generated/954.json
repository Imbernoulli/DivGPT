        "To determine how many kilometers Arvin ran on the 5th day, we need to follow the pattern of his running distances over the 5 days. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **First Day**: Arvin ran 2 kilometers.\n2. **Second Day**: He increased his running distance by 1 kilometer over the previous day. Therefore, he ran \\(2 + 1 = 3\\) kilometers.\n3. **Third Day**: He again increased his running distance by 1 kilometer over the previous day. Therefore, he ran \\(3 + 1 = 4\\) kilometers.\n4. **Fourth Day**: He increased his running distance by 1 kilometer over the previous day. Therefore, he ran \\(4 + 1 = 5\\) kilometers.\n5. **Fifth Day**: He increased his running distance by 1 kilometer over the previous day. Therefore, he ran \\(5 + 1 = 6\\) kilometers.\n\nSo, the number of kilometers Arvin ran on the 5th day is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",

Therefore, the number of kilometers Arvin ran on the 5th day is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
        "To determine how many kilometers Arvin ran on the 5th day, we need to calculate the distance he ran each day and then find the distance for the 5th day specifically. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the distance run on each day:**\n   - On the first day, Arvin ran 2 kilometers.\n   - On the second day, he increased his distance by 1 kilometer, so he ran \\(2 + 1 = 3\\) kilometers.\n   - On the third day, he increased his distance by another 1 kilometer, so he ran \\(3 + 1 = 4\\) kilometers.\n   - On the fourth day, he increased his distance by another 1 kilometer, so he ran \\(4 + 1 = 5\\) kilometers.\n   - On the fifth day, he increased his distance by another 1 kilometer, so he ran \\(5 + 1 = 6\\) kilometers.\n\n2. **Verify the total distance run over the 5 days:**\n   - First day: 2 kilometers\n   - Second day: 3 kilometers\n   - Third day: 4 kilometers\n   - Fourth day: 5 kilometers\n   - Fifth day: 6 kilometers\n\n   Adding these distances together:\n   \\[\n   2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20 \\text{ kilometers}\n   \\]\n   This confirms that the total distance run over the 5 days is indeed 20 kilometers, as required.\n\n3. **Determine the distance run on the 5th day:**\n   From our calculations, we see that on the 5th day, Arvin ran 6 kilometers.\n\nTherefore, the number of kilometers Arvin ran on the 5th day is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
        "To determine how many kilometers Arvin ran on the 5th day, we need to follow the pattern of his running distances. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **First Day:**\n   Arvin ran 2 kilometers.\n\n2. **Second Day:**\n   He increased his running distance by 1 kilometer over the previous day.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ km} + 1 \\text{ km} = 3 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Day:**\n   He increased his running distance by 1 kilometer over the previous day.\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ km} + 1 \\text{ km} = 4 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourth Day:**\n   He increased his running distance by 1 kilometer over the previous day.\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ km} + 1 \\text{ km} = 5 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Fifth Day:**\n   He increased his running distance by 1 kilometer over the previous day.\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ km} + 1 \\text{ km} = 6 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of kilometers Arvin ran on the 5th day is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."
