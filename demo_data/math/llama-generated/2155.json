        "To determine how many eggs Michael has now, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial number of crates Michael bought on Tuesday.\n2. Subtract the number of crates he gave to Susan.\n3. Add the number of crates he bought on Thursday.\n4. Convert the total number of crates into the total number of eggs.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Michael bought 6 crates of eggs on Tuesday.\n2. He gave out 2 crates to Susan. So, the number of crates left after giving some to Susan is:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2 = 4 \\text{ crates}\n   \\]\n3. Michael bought another 5 crates on Thursday. So, the total number of crates he has now is:\n   \\[\n   4 + 5 = 9 \\text{ crates}\n   \\]\n4. Since each crate holds 30 eggs, the total number of eggs Michael has now is:\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 30 = 270 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs Michael has now is \\boxed{270}.",

Calculate the total number of eggs based on the number of crates.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Michael bought 6 crates of eggs on Tuesday.\n2. He gave out 2 crates to Susan. So, the number of crates left after giving some to Susan is:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2 = 4\n   \\]\n3. Michael bought another 5 crates on Thursday. So, the total number of crates he has now is:\n   \\[\n   4 + 5 = 9\n   \\]\n4. Since each crate holds 30 eggs, the total number of eggs Michael has now is:\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 30 = 270\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs Michael has now is \\(\\boxed{270}\\).",
