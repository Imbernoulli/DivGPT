        "To determine how many turtles remained on the log, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of turtles:**\n   There are originally 9 turtles on the log.\n\n2. **Turtles climbed onto the log:**\n   Two less than three times the original number of turtles climbed onto the log. First, we calculate three times the original number of turtles:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 9 = 27\n   \\]\n   Then, we subtract 2 from this result:\n   \\[\n   27 - 2 = 25\n   \\]\n   So, 25 turtles climbed onto the log.\n\n3. **Total number of turtles on the log:**\n   Adding the original number of turtles to the number of turtles that climbed on:\n   \\[\n   9 + 25 = 34\n   \\]\n   Therefore, there are 34 turtles on the log now.\n\n4. **Turtles jumped off the log:**\n   Half of the large group of turtles jumped off the log.

        "Let's start by determining the number of turtles that climbed onto the log with the original group. The original number of turtles is 9.

        "To determine how many turtles remained on the log, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the original number of turtles on the log.\n   The original number of turtles is 9.\n\n2. Calculate the number of turtles that climbed onto the log.\n   According to the problem, two less than three times the original number of turtles climbed onto the log. So, we first find three times the original number of turtles:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 9 = 27\n   \\]\n   Then, we subtract 2 from this result:\n   \\[\n   27 - 2 = 25\n   \\]\n   Therefore, 25 turtles climbed onto the log.\n\n3. Determine the total number of turtles on the log after the new turtles climbed on.\n   We add the original number of turtles to the number of turtles that climbed onto the log:\n   \\[\n   9 + 25 = 34\n   \\]\n   So, there are 34 turtles on the log now.\n\n4. Calculate the number of turtles that jumped off the log.\n   Half of the large group of turtles jumped off the log. So, we find half of 34:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{34}{2} = 17\n   \\]\n   Therefore, 17 turtles jumped off the log.\n\n5. Determine the number of turtles that remained on the log.\n   We subtract the number of turtles that jumped off the log from the total number of turtles on the log:\n   \\[\n   34 - 17 = 17\n   \\]\n   So, there are 17 turtles remaining on the log.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{17}\n\\]",
