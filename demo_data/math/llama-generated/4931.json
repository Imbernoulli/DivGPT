        "To determine the total number of apple snails a snail kite eats over 5 days, we need to calculate the number of snails eaten each day and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many snails the snail kite eats each day:\n\n- **Day 1**: The snail kite eats 3 snails.\n- **Day 2**: The snail kite eats 2 more snails than it did on Day 1. Therefore, it eats \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) snails.\n- **Day 3**: The snail kite eats 2 more snails than it did on Day 2. Therefore, it eats \\(5 + 2 = 7\\) snails.\n- **Day 4**: The snail kite eats 2 more snails than it did on Day 3. Therefore, it eats \\(7 + 2 = 9\\) snails.\n- **Day 5**: The snail kite eats 2 more snails than it did on Day 4.
