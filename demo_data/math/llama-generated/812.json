So, we calculate 70% of $15000:\n\\[\n0.70 \\times 15000 = 10500 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Divide the band's share by the number of band members.**\n\nThere are 4 members in the band, so we divide the band's share by 4:\n\\[\n10500 \\div 4 = 2625 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, each band member gets \\(\\boxed{2625}\\) dollars from the concert.",
