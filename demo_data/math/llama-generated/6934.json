        "To determine the actual number of animals in the petting zoo, we need to adjust the countnearest Mary's mistakes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Mary thinks there are 60 animals.\n2. She double-counted 7 sheep. This means she counted these 7 sheep twice, so she has 7 extra animals in her count.\n3. She forgot to count 3 pigs. This means she is missing 3 animals in her count.\n\nTo find the actual number of animals, we need to subtract the extra sheep from her count and add the missing pigs. Here's the calculation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Actual number of animals} = \\text{Mary's count} - \\text{Extra sheep} + \\text{Missing pigs} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Actual number of animals} = 60 - 7 + 3 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Actual number of animals} = 56 \\]\n\nTherefore, the actual number of animals in the petting zoo is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",
        "To determine the actual number of animals in the petting zoo, we need to correct for the errors Mary made. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Mary double-counts 7 sheep. This means she counts these 7 sheep twice instead of once. Therefore, she has 7 more animals in her count than there actually are from the sheep.\n2. Mary forgets to count 3 pigs. This means she has 3 fewer animals in her count than there actually are from the pigs.\n\nThe net effect of these errors is that Mary's count is 7 more than the actual number of animals due to the double-counting of sheep, and 3 fewer than the actual number of animals due to the forgetting to count pigs. So, the net change in her count is \\(7 - 3 = 4\\) more animals than the actual number.\n\nIf Mary thinks there are 60 animals, we need to subtract these 4 extra animals from her count to find the actual number of animals. Therefore, the actual number of animals is:\n\\[60 - 4 = 56\\]\n\nSo, the actual number of animals in the petting zoo is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",

This means she did not include these 3 animals in her count.\n\nGiven that Mary thinks there are 60 animals, we need to subtract the extra sheep she counted and add the pigs she missed to get the actual number of animals.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n1. Subtract the double-counted sheep:\n   \\[\n   60 - 7 = 53\n   \\]\n\n2. Add the missed pigs:\n   \\[\n   53 + 3 = 56\n   \\]\n\nThus, the actual number of animals in the petting zoo is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",
        "To determine the actual number of animals in the petting zoo, we need to adjust for the errors Mary made in her count. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Mary thinks there are 60 animals.\n2. She double-counted 7 sheep. This means she counted these 7 sheep twice, so she has 7 more animals in her count than there actually are.\n3. She forgot to count 3 pigs. This means she has 3 fewer animals in her count than there actually are.\n\nTo find the actual number of animals, we need to subtract the 7 extra animals she counted and add the 3 animals she missed:\n\n\\[ 60 - 7 + 3 = 56 \\]\n\nTherefore, the actual number of animals in the petting zoo is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",
        "To determine the actual number of animals in the petting zoo, we need to adjust the count Mary made by accounting for the double-counted sheep and the\"-counted pigs.\n\n1. Mary thinks there are 60 animals.\n2. She double-counted 7 sheep, which means she counted these sheep twice instead of once. Therefore, she has 7 extra animals in her count.\n3. She forgot to count 3 pigs, which means she is missing 3 animals in her count.\n\nTo find the actual number of animals, we need to subtract the 7 extra sheep from her count and add the 3 pigs she missed:\n\n\\[ 60 - 7 + 3 = 56 \\]\n\nSo, the actual number of animals in the petting zoo is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",
        "To determine the actual number of animals in the petting zoo, we need to adjust the count Mary made by accounting for her mistakes. Mary double-counted 7 sheep and forgot to count 3 pigs. This means that her total count is increased by 7 (from double-counting) and decreased by 3 (from forgetting to count).\n\nLet's denote the actual number of animals in the petting zoo as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, Mary's count is given by:\n\\[ x + 7 - 3 = 60 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ x + 4 = 60 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 60 - 4 \\]\n\\[ x = 56 \\]\n\nTherefore, the actual number of animals in the petting zoo is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",
        "To determine the actual number of animals in the petting zoo, we need to adjust for the errors Mary made in her count. Mary double-counted 7 sheep, which means she counted these sheep twice instead of once. She also forgot to count 3 pigs, which means she did not count these pigs at all. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the error in counting the sheep:**\n   Mary double-counted 7 sheep. This means she counted 7 extra animals. To find the correct count, we need to subtract these 7 extra animals from her total count.\n\n2. **Identify the error in counting the pigs:**\n   Mary forgot to count 3 pigs. This means she missed 3 animals. To find the correct count, we need to add these 3 animals to her total count.\n\n3. **Calculate the correct total number of animals:**\n   Mary's initial count is 60 animals. We subtract the 7 extra sheep and add the 3 pigs to get the correct total.\n   \\[\n   60 - 7 + 3 = 56\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the actual number of animals in the petting zoo is \\(\\boxed{56}\\)."
