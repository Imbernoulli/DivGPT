Let's start by identifying the weight of each dog based on the information given:\n\n1. The brown dog weighs 4 pounds.\n2. The black dog weighs 1 pound more than the brown dog. Therefore, the black dog weighs \\(4 + 1 = 5\\) pounds.\n3. The white dog weighs twice as much as the brown dog. Therefore, the white dog weighs \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) pounds.\n4.
