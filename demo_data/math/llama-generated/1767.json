Therefore, the daily production is:\n\\[\n50 \\text{ candies/hour} \\times 10 \\text{ hours/day} = 500 \\text{ candies/day}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days are required to produce 4000 candies. We do this by dividing the total number of candies needed by the daily production:\n\\[\n4000 \\text{ candies} \\div 500 \\text{ candies/day} = 8 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nSo, it will take \\(\\boxed{8}\\) days to complete the order.",
