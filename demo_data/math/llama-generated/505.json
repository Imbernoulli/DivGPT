        "Let's start by determining how many candies each child had after their father gave them additional candies.\n\nInitially, Billy had 6 candies, Caleb had 11 candies, and Andy had 9 candies. Their father bought a packet of 36 candies and gave 8 candies to Billy, 11 candies to Caleb, and the rest to Andy.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many candies Andy received from their father:\n\\[ 36 - 8 - 11 = 17 \\]\nSo, Andy received 17 candies.\n\nNow, we add the candies each child received to their initial amounts:\n- Billy now has \\( 6 + 8 = 14 \\) candies.\n- Caleb now has \\( 11 + 11 = 22 \\) candies.\n- Andy now has \\( 9 + 17 = 26 \\) candies.\n\nNext, we find out how many more candies Andy has than Caleb:\n\\[ 26 - 22 = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy now has \\(\\boxed{4}\\) more candies than Caleb.",
