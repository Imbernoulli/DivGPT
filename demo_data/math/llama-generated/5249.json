        "First, we need to determine the total number of desks in the classroom. There are four rows with six desks each:\n\\[\n4 \\times 6 = 24\n\\]\nNext, we calculate how many desks are occupied, given that the desks are 2/3 full:\n\\[\n24 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 16\n\\]\nThis means there are 16 students in the classroom. We also know that 2 students are in the restroom. We need to find out how many students are absent. The problem states that the number of absent students is one less than three times the number of students in the restroom:\n\\[\n3 \\times 2 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5\n\\]\nSo, there are 5 students absent.
