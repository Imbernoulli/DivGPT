        "To determine how many bottles of 2-liter water Ivy should buy for her 4 days consumption, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of water Ivy drinks in 4 days.\n2. Determine how many 2-liter bottles are needed to cover that total amount of water.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of water Ivy drinks in 4 days. Ivy drinks 2.5 liters of water each day, so for 4 days, the total amount of water is:\n\\[ 2.5 \\text{ liters/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 10 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many 2-liter bottles are required to cover 10 liters of water. Since each bottle contains 2 liters, we divide the total amount of water by the capacity of each bottle:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ liters} \\div 2 \\text{ liters/bottle} = 5 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nTherefore, Ivy should buy \\(\\boxed{5}\\) bottles of 2-liter water for her 4 days consumption.",

Therefore, over 4 days, her total water consumption is:\n\\[ 2.5 \\text{ liters/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 10 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many 2-liter bottles are required to meet this total consumption.**\n\nEach bottle contains 2 liters of water. To find out how many bottles are needed for 10 liters, we divide the total consumption by the capacity of each bottle:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ liters} \\div 2 \\text{ liters/bottle} = 5 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nThus, Ivy should buy \\(\\boxed{5}\\) bottles of 2-liter water for her 4 days consumption.",
