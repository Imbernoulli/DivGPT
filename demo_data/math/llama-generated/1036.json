        "Let the price of a child's ticket be denoted by \\( x \\) dollars. Since the price of an adult ticket is twice that of a child's ticket, the price of an adult ticket is \\( 2x \\) dollars.\n\nThe total revenue from the adult tickets is given by the number of adult tickets sold multiplied by the price of each adult ticket, which is \\( 400 \\times 2x = 800x \\) dollars.\n\nThe total revenue from the children's tickets is given by the number of children's tickets sold multiplied by the price of each child's ticket, which is \\( 200 \\times x = 200x \\) dollars.\n\nThe total amount collected from both adult and children's tickets is the sum of the revenue from the adult tickets and the revenue from the children's tickets. According to the problem, this total amount is $16,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 800x + 200x = 16000 \\]\n\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 1000x = 16000 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1000:\n\\[ x = \\frac{16000}{1000} = 16 \\]\n\nSo, the price of a child's ticket is $16. Since the price of an adult ticket is twice that of a child's ticket, the price of an adult ticket is:\n\\[ 2x = 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\]\n\nTherefore, the price of an adult ticket is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
        "To determine the price of an adult ticket, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information.
