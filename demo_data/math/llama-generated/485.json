        "To determine how many objects Bill tossed into the river, we start by identifying the number of sticks and rocks each person threw based on the given information.\n\nFirst, we know that Ted tossed 10 sticks and 10 rocks into the river. According to the problem, Bill threw 6 more sticks into the river than Ted. Therefore, we can calculate the number of sticks Bill threw as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of sticks Bill threw} = \\text{Number of sticks Ted threw} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Ted threw twice as many rocks into the river as Bill. Therefore, we can calculate the number of rocks Bill threw as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of rocks Bill threw} = \\frac{\\text{Number of rocks Ted threw}}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n\\]\n\nTo find the total number of objects Bill tossed into the river, we add the number of sticks and rocks he threw:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of objects Bill tossed} = \\text{Number of sticks Bill threw} + \\text{Number of rocks Bill threw} = 16 + 5 = 21\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of objects Bill tossed into the river is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",

        "To determine how many objects Bill tossed into the river, we start by identifying the number of sticks and rocks Ted tossed. According to the problem, Ted tossed 10 sticks and 10 rocks into the river.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of sticks Bill tossed. The problem states that Bill throws 6 more sticks into the river than Ted does. Since Ted threw 10 sticks, we can find the number of sticks Bill threw by adding 6 to the number of sticks Ted threw:\n\\[\n10 + 6 = 16\n\\]\nSo, Bill threw 16 sticks into the river.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of rocks Bill tossed. The problem states that Ted tosses twice as many rocks into the river as Bill does. Since Ted threw 10 rocks, we can find the number of rocks Bill threw by dividing the number of rocks Ted threw by 2:\n\\[\n10 \\div 2 = 5\n\\]\nSo, Bill threw 5 rocks into the river.\n\nNow, we find the total number of objects Bill tossed into the river by adding the number of sticks and rocks he threw:\n\\[\n16 + 5 = 21\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of objects Bill tossed into the river is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{21}\n\\]",
