        "First, we determine the total number of marbles Cindy gave to her four friends. Since each friend received 80 marbles, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 80 \\times 4 = 320 \\]\n\nThis means Cindy gave away 320 marbles. To find out how many marbles she has left, we subtract the number of marbles given away from the original number of marbles:\n\n\\[ 500 - 320 = 180 \\]\n\nCindy has 180 marbles remaining. We need to find four times this number:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 180 = 720 \\]\n\nTherefore, four times the number of marbles Cindy has remaining is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{720} \\]",
