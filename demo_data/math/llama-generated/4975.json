Therefore, the number of apples one tree can produce is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ baskets/tree} \\times 15 \\text{ apples/basket} = 300 \\text{ apples/tree} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many apples 10 trees can produce. Since one tree produces 300 apples, 10 trees will produce:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ trees} \\times 300 \\text{ apples/tree} = 3000 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of apples from 10 trees is \\(\\boxed{3000}\\).",
