        "To determine the cost of transporting three times as many cement bags, each weighing \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) times as many kgs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total weight of the original 80 bags of cement:**\n   Each bag weighs 50 kgs, so the total weight is:\n   \\[\n   80 \\times 50 = 4000 \\text{ kgs}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total weight of the new set of cement bags:**\n   The new set consists of three times as many bags, so there are:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 80 = 240 \\text{ bags}\n   \\]\n   Each new bag weighs \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) times as much as the original bags, so each new bag weighs:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{5} \\times 50 = 30 \\text{ kgs}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total weight of the new set of bags is:\n   \\[\n   240 \\times 30 = 7200 \\text{ kgs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the cost per kilogram of transporting cement:**\n   The original cost to transport 4000 kgs is $6000, so the cost per kilogram is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6000}{4000} = 1.5 \\text{ dollars per kg}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the cost to transport the new set of cement bags:**\n   The cost to transport 7200 kgs at $1.5 per kilogram is:\n   \\[\n   7200 \\times 1.5 = 10800 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the cost of transporting three times as many cement bags, each weighing \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) times as many kgs, is \\(\\boxed{10800}\\).",
