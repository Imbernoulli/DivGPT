Add up the total riding time for all 6 days.\n   \\[\n   12 + 3 + 6 = 21 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours William rode his horse during those 6 days is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of hours William rode his horse over the 6 days, we need to calculate the hours he rode each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the hours he rode on the days he used the maximum riding time:\n- The maximum riding time per day is 6 hours.\n- He used the maximum riding time twice.\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 6 = 12 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the hours he rode on the days he rode for only 1.5 hours:\n- He rode for 1.5 hours each day.\n- He did this for two days.\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 1.5 = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the hours he rode on the days he rode for half the maximum time:\n- Half of the maximum riding time is \\(\\frac{6}{2} = 3\\) hours.\n- He did this for two days.\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum up the hours from all the days:\n\n\\[\n12 \\text{ hours} + 3 \\text{ hours} + 6 \\text{ hours} = 21 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours William rode his horse during those 6 days is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
