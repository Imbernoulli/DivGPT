        "To determine how many individual corn cobs Clyde picked, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total weight of corn Clyde picked:**\n   Clyde picked 2 bushels of corn. Since each bushel weighs 56 pounds, we multiply the number of bushels by the weight of each bushel:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ bushels} \\times 56 \\text{ pounds per bushel} = 112 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the weight of each individual ear of corn:**\n   Each ear of corn weighs 0.5 pounds.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of ears of corn:**\n   To find out how many ears of corn correspond to the total weight, we divide the total weight by the weight of each ear:\n   \\[\n   112 \\text{ pounds} \\div 0.5 \\text{ pounds per ear} = 224 \\text{ ears of corn}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of individual corn cobs Clyde picked is \\(\\boxed{224}\\).",

Since Clyde picked 2 bushels, the total weight of the corn he picked is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ bushels} \\times 56 \\text{ pounds per bushel} = 112 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we know that each individual ear of corn weighs 0.5 pounds. To find out how many ears of corn correspond to 112 pounds, we divide the total weight by the weight of each ear:\n\\[ 112 \\text{ pounds} \\div 0.5 \\text{ pounds per ear} = 224 \\text{ ears of corn} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of individual corn cobs Clyde picked is \\(\\boxed{224}\\).",
