To find the number of pages needed, we divide the total number of cards by the number of cards each page can hold:\n\\[ 420 \\div 10 = 42 \\]\n\nSince 420 divided by 10 is exactly 42, Punger needs 42 pages to hold all his baseball cards. Therefore, the number of pages Punger needs to buy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{42} \\]",
