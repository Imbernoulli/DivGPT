Teairra has 5 shirts in total, and 3 of them are plaid. Therefore, the number of shirts that are not plaid is:\n\\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of pants that are not purple. Teairra has 24 pairs of pants in total, and 5 of them are purple. Therefore, the number of pants that are not purple is:\n\\[ 24 - 5 = 19 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of shirts that are not plaid to the number of pants that are not purple to find the total number of items that are neither plaid nor purple:\n\\[ 2 + 19 = 21 \\]\n\nThus, the number of shirts and pants that Teairra has which are neither plaid nor purple is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
