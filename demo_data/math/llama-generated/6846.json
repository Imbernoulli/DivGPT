He buys apples from farmers and then transports them to the grocery stores and sells them for profit.  He buys individual apples from farmers at a cost of $12 per bushel, and sells them to the stores at a price of $0.40 per apple.  If each bushel contains 48 apples, then how much profit, in dollars, does he make after selling 100 apples?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine Bronson's profit after selling 100 apples, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the apples Bronson buys.\n2. Calculate the revenue from selling the apples.\n3. Subtract the cost from the revenue to find the profit.\n\nFirst, let's find out the cost of the apples Bronson buys. Each bushel contains 48 apples, and he buys apples at a cost of $12 per bushel. Therefore, the cost per apple is:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{48} = 0.25 \\text{ dollars per apple}\n\\]\nSince Bronson sells 100 apples, the total cost for these apples is:\n\\[\n100 \\times 0.25 = 25 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the revenue from selling the apples. Bronson sells each apple for $0.40, so the total revenue from selling 100 apples is:\n\\[\n100 \\times 0.40 = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:\n\\[\n40 - 25 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Bronson's profit after selling 100 apples is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]",
