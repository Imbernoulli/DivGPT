Add his earnings for the week to his savings:\n\\[\n65 \\text{ dollars} + 29 \\text{ dollars} = 94 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the total cost of the bike from the sum of his savings and earnings.**\n\nThe bike costs $100. Subtract the total amount Zach has from the cost of the bike:\n\\[\n100 \\text{ dollars} - 94 \\text{ dollars} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Zach needs to earn \\boxed{6} more dollars before he can buy the bike.",

        "To determine how much more money Zach needs to earn before he can buy the bike, we need to calculate his total earnings from his planned activities and then subtract this from the total cost of the bike.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Zach's earnings from each activity:\n1. **Weekly allowance**: Zach receives $5 each week. Since he will receive his allowance on Friday, he will earn $5.\n2. **Mowing the lawn**: Zach's parent pays him $10 to mow the lawn.\n3. **Babysitting**: Zach's neighbor pays him $7 per hour. Since he plans on babysitting for 2 hours, he will earn $7/hour * 2 hours = $14.\n\nNext, we add up all of Zach's earnings:\n\\[\n5 + 10 + 14 = 29\n\\]\n\nZach has already saved up $65. Therefore, his total savings before earnings will be:\n\\[\n65 + 29 = 94\n\\]\n\nThe cost of the bike is $100. To find out how much more money Zach needs, we subtract his total savings from the cost of the bike:\n\\[\n100 - 94 = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, Zach needs to earn \\boxed{6} more dollars before he can buy the bike.",
        "To determine how much more money Zach needs to earn before he can buy the bike, we need to calculate his total earnings for the upcoming week and then subtract this from the total cost of the bike minus what he has already saved.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Zach's earnings for the upcoming week:\n- Zach will receive his weekly allowance of $5.\n- Zach will earn $10 for mowing the lawn.\n- Zach will earn $7 per hour for babysitting, and he plans to babysit for 2 hours, so he will earn $7 * 2 = $14.\n\nAdding these amounts together, Zach's total earnings for the upcoming week are:\n\\[ 5 + 10 + 14 = 29 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much more money Zach needs to earn. The bike costs $100, and Zach has already saved $65. Therefore, the total amount of money Zach still needs is:\n\\[ 100 - 65 = 35 \\]\n\nSince Zach will earn $29 this week, we subtract this from the total amount he still needs:\n\\[ 35 - 29 = 6 \\]\n\nSo, Zach needs to earn \\(\\boxed{6}\\) more dollars before he can buy the bike.",
