Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the number of women's T-shirts sold in one hour is:\n\\[ \\frac{60}{30} = 2 \\]\nTherefore, in 12 hours, the number of women's T-shirts sold is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 2 = 24 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many men's T-shirts are sold in a day.**\nMen's T-shirts are sold every 40 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the number of men's T-shirts sold in one hour is:\n\\[ \\frac{60}{40} = 1.5 \\]\nTherefore, in 12 hours, the number of men's T-shirts sold is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 1.5 = 18 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the daily earnings from women's T-shirts.**\nEach woman's T-shirt is sold for $18.
