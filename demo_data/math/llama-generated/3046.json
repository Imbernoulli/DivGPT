        "To determine the number of green balls Ryan has, we start by analyzing the given information:\n\n1. Ryan has a total of 40 balls.\n2. There are twice as many red balls as blue balls.\n3. The rest of the balls are green.\n4. Ryan has 11 blue balls.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of red balls. Since there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, we multiply the number of blue balls by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red balls} = 2 \\times 11 = 22\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the number of red balls and blue balls to find out how many balls are either red or blue:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of red and blue balls} = 22 + 11 = 33\n\\]\n\nSince Ryan has 40 balls in total, we subtract the number of red and blue balls from the total number of balls to find the number of green balls:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of green balls} = 40 - 33 = 7\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of green balls is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",

According to the problem, there are twice as many red balls as blue balls. Since there are 11 blue balls, the number of red balls is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 11 = 22\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the total number of red and blue balls. Adding the number of red balls and blue balls gives:\n   \\[\n   22 + 11 = 33\n   \\]\n\n3. Determine the number of green balls. Since the total number of balls is 40, the number of green balls is the total number of balls minus the number of red and blue balls:\n   \\[\n   40 - 33 = 7\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of green balls is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."
