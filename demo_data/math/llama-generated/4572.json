        "To determine the total number of polka-dot blankets Estevan has after his birthday, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial number of polka-dot blankets:**\n   Estevan starts with 24 blankets. According to the problem, one-third of these blankets have polka-dots. Therefore, we need to find one-third of 24:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 24 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, Estevan initially has 8 polka-dot blankets.\n\n2. **Add the new polka-dot blankets:**\n   For his birthday, Estevan's mother gives him 2 more polka-dot print blankets. We need to add these 2 blankets to the initial 8 polka-dot blankets:\n   \\[\n   8 + 2 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total number of polka-dot blankets:**\n   After adding the new blankets, Estevan has a total of 10 polka-dot blankets.\n\nThus, the total number of polka-dot blankets Estevan has is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
