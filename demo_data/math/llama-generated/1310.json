Add the total revenue from the cupcakes and the total revenue from the cookies to get the final amount of money made.\n\nLet's start with the reduced price of each cupcake:\nThe original price of a cupcake is $3.00. When reduced by half, the price becomes:\n\\[ 3.00 \\div 2 = 1.50 \\]\nSo, each cupcake is now $1.50.\n\nNext, let's calculate the reduced price of each cookie:\nThe original price of a cookie is $2.00. When reduced by half, the price becomes:\n\\[ 2.00 \\div 2 = 1.00 \\]\nSo, each cookie is now $1.00.\n\nNow, let's determine the total revenue from the cupcakes:\nCrystal sold 16 cupcakes at $1.50 each. The total revenue from the cupcakes is:\n\\[ 16 \\times 1.50 = 24 \\]\nSo, the total revenue from the cupcakes is $24.\n\nNext, let's determine the total revenue from the cookies:\nCrystal sold 8 cookies at $1.00 each. The total revenue from the cookies is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 1.00 = 8 \\]\nSo, the total revenue from the cookies is $8.\n\nFinally, let's add the total revenue from the cupcakes and the total revenue from the cookies to get the final amount of money made:\n\\[ 24 + 8 = 32 \\]\nSo, the total amount of money Crystal made is:\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]",
