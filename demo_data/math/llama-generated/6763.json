The recipe he is following calls for 2 ounces of butter for every 1 cup of baking mix; however, it allows 2 ounces of coconut oil to be substituted for the 2 ounces of butter if necessary.  The chef would like to use as much butter as possible before switching over and substituting coconut oil.  If the chef had 4 ounces of butter remaining, and he plans on using 6 cups of baking mix, how many ounces of coconut oil will he end up using?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many ounces of coconut oil the pastry chef will use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of butter required for 6 cups of baking mix:**\n   The recipe calls for 2 ounces of butter for every 1 cup of baking mix.

Calculate how much coconut oil is needed to cover the remaining weight of butter.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of butter required for 6 cups of baking mix. The recipe calls for 2 ounces of butter for every 1 cup of baking mix. Therefore, for 6 cups of baking mix, the total amount of butter needed is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ cups} \\times 2 \\text{ ounces per cup} = 12 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nNext, we know the chef has 4 ounces of butter remaining. So, the amount of butter he can use is 4 ounces. To find out how many ounces of coconut oil are needed, we subtract the amount of butter he can use from the total amount of butter required:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ ounces} - 4 \\text{ ounces} = 8 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nTherefore, the chef will end up using \\(\\boxed{8}\\) ounces of coconut oil.",
