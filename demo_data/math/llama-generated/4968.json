        "To determine Hannah's pay for the week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Hannah's total earnings before any deductions.\n2. Determine the total amount deducted for being late.\n3. Subtract the total deductions from the total earnings to find her final pay.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Hannah's total earnings before any deductions.**\n\nHannah makes $30 per hour and works 18 hours per week. Therefore, her total earnings are:\n\\[ 30 \\, \\text{dollars/hour} \\times 18 \\, \\text{hours} = 540 \\, \\text{dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total amount deducted for being late.**\n\nHannah is docked $5 each time she is late. If she was late 3 times this week, the total deduction is:\n\\[ 5 \\, \\text{dollars/late} \\times 3 \\, \\text{late} = 15 \\, \\text{dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the total deductions from the total earnings to find her final pay.**\n\nHannah's final pay is:\n\\[ 540 \\, \\text{dollars} - 15 \\, \\text{dollars} = 525 \\, \\text{dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Hannah gets paid \\(\\boxed{525}\\) dollars this week."
