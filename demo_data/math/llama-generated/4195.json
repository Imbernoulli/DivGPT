        "To determine how much money Kyle has, we start by calculating how much money Kyle initially has based on how much Dave has. Dave has $46, and Kyle has $12 less than 3 times what Dave has. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Kyle's initial amount} = 3 \\times \\text{Dave's amount} - 12 \\]\n\nSubstituting Dave's amount into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Kyle's initial amount} = 3 \\times 46 - 12 \\]\n\nFirst, we perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 46 = 138 \\]\n\nThen, we subtract $12 from $138:\n\n\\[ 138 - 12 = 126 \\]\n\nSo, Kyle initially has $126.
