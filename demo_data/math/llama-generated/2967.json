        "To determine the difference in price between the two stores, we need to calculate the final price of the computer at each store after applying the respective discounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the final price at the first store:\n1. The original price of the computer is $950.\n2. The discount is 6%. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 6% (or 0.06):\n   \\[\n   950 \\times 0.06 = 57\n   \\]\n3. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the final price:\n   \\[\n   950 - 57 = 893\n   \\]\n   So, the final price at the first store is $893.\n\nNext, let's calculate the final price at the second store:\n1. The original price of the computer is €920.\n2. The discount is 5%. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 5% (or 0.05):\n   \\[\n   920 \\times 0.05 = 46\n   \\]\n3. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the final price:\n   \\[\n   920 - 46 = 874\n   \\]\n   So, the final price at the second store is €874.\n\nSince the problem does not specify that the prices need to be converted to the same unit, we can directly find the difference in price between the two stores:\n\\[\n893 - 874 = 19\n\\]\nTherefore, the difference in price between the two stores is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).",

Subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the final price:\n   \\[\n   920 - 46 = 874\n   \\]\nSo, the final price at the second store is €874.\n\nTo find the difference in price between the two stores, we need to convert the price at the second store to dollars. Assuming the conversion rate is 1 euro = 1 dollar, the price at the second store in dollars is $874.
