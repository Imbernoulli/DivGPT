        "To determine how many jellybeans Lorelai has eaten, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many jellybeans Rory has.\n2. Calculate the total number of jellybeans that both Rory and Gigi have.\n3. Determine how many jellybeans Lorelai has eaten by multiplying the total number of jellybeans that both girls have by 3.\n\nFirst, we know that Gigi has 15 jellybeans. Rory has 30 more jellybeans than Gigi. Therefore, we can calculate the number of jellybeans Rory has as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of jellybeans Rory has} = 15 + 30 = 45 \\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of jellybeans that both Rory and Gigi have by adding the number of jellybeans each has:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of jellybeans} = 15 + 45 = 60 \\]\n\nLorelai has eaten three times the number of jellybeans that both girls have. Therefore, we can calculate the number of jellybeans Lorelai has eaten as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of jellybeans Lorelai has eaten} = 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\]\n\nThus, the number of jellybeans Lorelai has eaten is \\(\\boxed{180}\\).",

Rory has 30 more jellybeans than Gigi, so we can calculate the number of jellybeans Rory has as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of jellybeans Rory has} = 15 + 30 = 45 \\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of jellybeans that both Rory and Gigi have by adding the number of jellybeans each has:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of jellybeans} = 15 + 45 = 60 \\]\n\nLorelai has eaten three times the number of jellybeans that both girls have. Therefore, we calculate the number of jellybeans Lorelai has eaten as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of jellybeans Lorelai has eaten} = 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\]\n\nSo, the number of jellybeans Lorelai has eaten is \\(\\boxed{180}\\).",

Therefore, we can calculate the number of jellybeans Rory has as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of jellybeans Rory has} = 15 + 30 = 45 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of jellybeans that both Rory and Gigi have together:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of jellybeans} = 15 + 45 = 60 \\]\n\nLorelai has eaten three times the number of jellybeans that both girls have. Therefore, we can calculate the number of jellybeans Lorelai has eaten as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of jellybeans Lorelai has eaten} = 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\]\n\nThus, the number of jellybeans Lorelai has eaten is \\(\\boxed{180}\\).",
