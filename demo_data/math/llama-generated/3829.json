        "To determine the total number of tomatoes Mabel has, we need to calculate the number of tomatoes each plant produced and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's identify the number of tomatoes on each plant:\n1.

The third plant bore three times the number of tomatoes as the first two plants combined. The first two plants combined bore \\(8 + 12 = 20\\) tomatoes.
