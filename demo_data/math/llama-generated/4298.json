        "To determine how many miles Mira can jog in five days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the distance Mira jogs in one day.\n2. Multiply the daily distance by the number of days she jogs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Mira jogs in one day. She jogs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for 2 hours each day. Therefore, the distance she jogs in one day is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 10 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many miles she jogs in five days. Since she jogs 10 miles each day, the total distance she jogs in five days is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 50 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of miles Mira can jog in five days is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
        "To determine how many miles Mira can jog in five days, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. Calculate the distance Mira jogs in one day.\n   - Mira jogs at a speed of 5 miles per hour.\n   - She jogs for 2 hours each morning.\n   - Therefore, the distance she jogs in one day is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 10 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n2. Calculate the distance Mira jogs in five days.\n   - She jogs 10 miles each day.\n   - Over five days, the total distance she jogs is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 50 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total distance Mira can jog in five days is \\(\\boxed{50}\\) miles."
