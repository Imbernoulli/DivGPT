        "To determine how many more water breaks James takes than sitting breaks, we need to calculate the number of each type of break he takes and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of water breaks. James takes a water break every 20 minutes. Since he works for 240 minutes, we divide 240 by 20:\n\\[\n\\frac{240}{20} = 12\n\\]\nSo, James takes 12 water breaks.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of sitting breaks. James takes a sitting break every 120 minutes.
