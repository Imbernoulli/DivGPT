        "To determine how many eggs Samantha will have left by the time she recovers her capital from the sales, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the crate of eggs.\n2. Determine the selling price of each egg.\n3. Calculate how many eggs she needs to sell to recover her capital.\n4. Subtract the number of eggs sold from the total number of eggs initially bought.\n\nFirst, the total cost of the crate of eggs is $5. Since Samantha sells each egg for 20 cents, we need to convert the selling price into dollars for consistency in units. Therefore, 20 cents is equal to $0.20.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many eggs she needs to sell to recover her capital. This can be calculated by dividing the total cost of the crate by the selling price per egg:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of eggs needed to recover capital} = \\frac{5}{0.20} = 25\n\\]\n\nSo, Samantha needs to sell 25 eggs to recover her capital. Since she initially bought 30 eggs, the number of eggs she will have left after selling 25 eggs is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of eggs left} = 30 - 25 = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of eggs Samantha will have left by the time she recovers her capital from the sales is \\boxed{5}.",

Calculate the total cost of the crate of eggs.\n2. Determine the total revenue from selling each egg.\n3. Find out how many eggs need to be sold to recover the capital.\n4. Calculate the number of eggs left after recovering the capital.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the crate of eggs.**\n\nThe total cost of the crate is $5.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling each egg.**\n\nEach egg is sold for 20 cents. To convert this to dollars, we use the fact that 20 cents is $0.20. Therefore, the revenue from selling one egg is $0.20.\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many eggs need to be sold to recover the capital.**\n\nTo find out how many eggs need to be sold to recover the $5 capital, we divide the total cost by the revenue per egg:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{0.20} = 25\n\\]\nSo, Samantha needs to sell 25 eggs to recover her $5 capital.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of eggs left after recovering the capital.**\n\nSamantha started with 30 eggs and sold 25 eggs. Therefore, the number of eggs left is:\n\\[\n30 - 25 = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of eggs Samantha will have left by the time she recovers her capital from the sales is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

If she sells \\( x \\) eggs, her total revenue is \\( 0.20x \\) dollars.\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many eggs she needs to sell to recover her capital.**\n\nTo recover her capital, her total revenue must equal the total cost of the crate. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\\[ 0.20x = 5 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.20:\n\\[ x = \\frac{5}{0.20} = \\frac{5}{\\frac{1}{5}} = 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\]\n\nSo, Samantha needs to sell 25 eggs to recover her capital.\n\n**Step 4: Determine how many eggs she will have left.**\n\nSamantha started with 30 eggs and sold 25 eggs. Therefore, the number of eggs she will have left is:\n\\[ 30 - 25 = 5 \\]\n\nThus, the number of eggs Samantha will have left by the time she recovers her capital from the sales is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
