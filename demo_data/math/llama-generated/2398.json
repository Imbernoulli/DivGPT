        "To determine the current age of July's husband, we need to follow a series of logical steps based on the information provided.\n\n1. **Determine the age of July when Hannah was 6 years old:**\n   - When Hannah was 6 years old, her age was double the age of her sister July.\n   - Let \\( J \\) represent July's age at that time.\n   - Therefore, we can write the equation: \\( 6 = 2J \\).\n\n2. **Solve for \\( J \\):**\n   \\[\n   6 = 2J\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   J = \\frac{6}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   J = 3\n   \\]\n   So, July was 3 years old when Hannah was 6 years old.\n\n3. **Determine the current age of July:**\n   - It is now 20 years later.\n   - Therefore, July's current age is:\n   \\[\n   3 + 20 = 23\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the current age of July's husband:**\n   - July's husband is 2 years older than July.\n   - Therefore, his current age is:\n   \\[\n   23 + 2 = 25\n   \\]\n\nThus, the current age of July's husband is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
