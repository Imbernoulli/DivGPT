        "To determine how much money Ned makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of a left-handed mouse.\n2. Determine the number of days the store is open in a week.\n3. Calculate the daily revenue from selling left-handed mice.\n4. Calculate the weekly revenue.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of a left-handed mouse.**\n\nThe cost of a normal mouse is $120. Since left-handed mice cost 30% more than normal mice, we can calculate the cost of a left-handed mouse as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of a left-handed mouse} = 120 + 0.30 \\times 120 = 120 + 36 = 156\n\\]\nSo, each left-handed mouse costs $156.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of days the store is open in a week.**\n\nThe store is open every day except Sunday, Thursday, and Friday. Therefore, the store is open:\n\\[\n7 - 3 = 4 \\text{ days}\n\\]\nSo, the store is open 4 days a week.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the daily revenue from selling left-handed mice.**\n\nNed sells 25 left-handed mice each day. The daily revenue can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Daily revenue} = 25 \\times 156 = 3900\n\\]\nSo, the daily revenue is $3900.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the weekly revenue.**\n\nSince the store is open 4 days a week, the weekly revenue is:\n\\[\n\\text{Weekly revenue} = 4 \\times 3900 = 15600\n\\]\nSo, the weekly revenue is $15600.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Ned makes a week is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15600}\n\\]",
