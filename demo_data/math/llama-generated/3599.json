        "To determine how many mistakes Nadia will make on average if she plays for 8 minutes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of notes Nadia plays in 8 minutes.\n2. Determine the number of mistakes she makes per note.\n3. Use the total number of notes and the mistake rate to find the total number of mistakes.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of notes Nadia plays in 8 minutes. Since she plays 60 notes per minute, we multiply the number of notes per minute by the number of minutes:\n\n\\[ 60 \\text{ notes/minute} \\times 8 \\text{ minutes} = 480 \\text{ notes} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Nadia makes 3 mistakes per 40 notes. To find out how many mistakes she makes per note, we divide the number of mistakes by the number of notes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\text{ mistakes}}{40 \\text{ notes}} = 0.075 \\text{ mistakes/note} \\]\n\nNow, we use the total number of notes and the mistake rate to find the total number of mistakes. We multiply the total number of notes by the mistake rate:\n\n\\[ 480 \\text{ notes} \\times 0.075 \\text{ mistakes/note} = 36 \\text{ mistakes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of mistakes Nadia will make on average if she plays for 8 minutes is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
