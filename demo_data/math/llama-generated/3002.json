        "To determine the amount Lucille spends on employee salaries, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total revenue. The ratio of the revenue allocated to employee salaries to stock purchases is 4:11. This means that for every $15 (4 + 11) of revenue, $4 goes to employee salaries and $11 goes to stock purchases.\n\nGiven that the total revenue is $3000, we first need to find out how many times $15 fits into $3000. This can be calculated by dividing $3000 by $15:\n\\[\n\\frac{3000}{15} = 200\n\\]\nThis tells us that the ratio of 4:11 is applied 200 times to the total revenue. Therefore, the amount spent on employee salaries is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 200 = 800\n\\]\nSo, the total amount of money Lucille spends on employee salaries is \\(\\boxed{800}\\).",
