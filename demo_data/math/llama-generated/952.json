Since one dozen equals 12 pieces, we can calculate the number of pieces in 3 dozens as follows:\n\\[ 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\]\nAdding the 10 pieces she also bought gives:\n\\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \\]\nSo, Emma bought a total of 46 pieces of macarons.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pieces of macarons were eaten by subtracting the number of macarons left over from the total number of macarons bought. Emma has 15 pieces of macarons left over, so we subtract 15 from 46:\n\\[ 46 - 15 = 31 \\]\nTherefore, the number of pieces of macarons eaten is:\n\\[ \\boxed{31} \\]",
