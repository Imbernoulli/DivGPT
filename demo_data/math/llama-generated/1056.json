        "To determine the total number of fruits the apple tree grew over the three seasons, we need to calculate the production for each season and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **First Season:**\n   The tree produced 200 apples.\n\n2. **Second Season:**\n   The tree made 20% fewer fruits than in the first season. To find out how many apples this is, we calculate 20% of 200 and subtract it from 200.\n   \\[\n   20\\% \\text{ of } 200 = 0.20 \\times 200 = 40\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the production in the second season is:\n   \\[\n   200 - 40 = 160\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Season:**\n   The tree's fruit production in the second season doubled during the third season.
