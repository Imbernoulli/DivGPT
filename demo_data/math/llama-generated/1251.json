        "To determine the speed at which Gerald's car averaged, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Polly's speed:**\n   - Polly circles the track 12 times in one half hour.\n   - The track is one-quarter mile long.\n   - First, find the total distance Polly travels:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total distance} = \\text{Number of laps} \\times \\text{Length of each lap} = 12 \\times 0.25 = 3 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n   - Polly takes one half hour to travel 3 miles.\n   - Convert one half hour to hours:\n     \\[\n     0.5 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate Polly's speed:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Polly's speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{3 \\text{ miles}}{0.5 \\text{ hours}} = 6 \\text{ miles per hour}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine Gerald's speed:**\n   - Gerald's car moves at an average speed half of what Polly did.\n   - Calculate half of Polly's speed:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gerald's speed} = \\frac{\\text{Polly's speed}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 3 \\text{ miles per hour}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the speed that Gerald's car averaged is \\(\\boxed{3}\\) miles per hour.",
