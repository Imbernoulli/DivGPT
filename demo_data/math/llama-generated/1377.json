        "To determine the total number of marshmallows held by Haley, Michael, and Brandon, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of marshmallows Michael can hold:**\n   - Haley can hold 8 marshmallows.\n   - Michael can hold 3 times as many marshmallows as Haley.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 8 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, Michael can hold 24 marshmallows.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of marshmallows Brandon can hold:**\n   - Brandon can hold half as many marshmallows as Michael.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n   \\]\n   So, Brandon can hold 12 marshmallows.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of marshmallows held by all three kids:**\n   - Haley holds 8 marshmallows.\n   - Michael holds 24 marshmallows.\n   - Brandon holds 12 marshmallows.\n   \\[\n   8 + 24 + 12 = 44\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of marshmallows held by all three kids is \\boxed{44}.",
        "To determine the total number of marshmallows held by Haley, Michael, and Brandon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of marshmallows Michael can hold:**\n   Michael can hold 3 times as many marshmallows as Haley. Since Haley can hold 8 marshmallows, we multiply 8 by 3:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 3 = 24\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Michael can hold 24 marshmallows.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of marshmallows Brandon can hold:**\n   Brandon can hold half as many marshmallows as Michael. Since Michael can hold 24 marshmallows, we divide 24 by 2:\n   \\[\n   24 \\div 2 = 12\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Brandon can hold 12 marshmallows.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of marshmallows held by all three kids:**\n   We add the number of marshmallows held by Haley, Michael, and Brandon:\n   \\[\n   8 + 24 + 12\n   \\]\n   First, add 8 and 24:\n   \\[\n   8 + 24 = 32\n   \\]\n   Then, add 32 and 12:\n   \\[\n   32 + 12 = 44\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of marshmallows held by all three kids is \\boxed{44}.",

So, we calculate the number of marshmallows Michael holds by multiplying Haley's marshmallows by 3:\n\\[ \\text{Michael's marshmallows} = 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Brandon can hold half as many marshmallows as Michael. So, we calculate the number of marshmallows Brandon holds by dividing Michael's marshmallows by 2:\n\\[ \\text{Brandon's marshmallows} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of marshmallows held by Haley, Michael, and Brandon to find the total number of marshmallows:\n\\[ \\text{Total marshmallows} = \\text{Haley's marshmallows} + \\text{Michael's marshmallows} + \\text{Brandon's marshmallows} = 8 + 24 + 12 = 44 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of marshmallows held by all three kids is:\n\\[ \\boxed{44} \\]",
