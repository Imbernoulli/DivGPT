        "To determine how many large rubber-band balls Michael can make with the remaining rubber bands, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of rubber bands Michael has already used to make the small balls.\n2. Subtract the number of rubber bands used from the original pack to find out how many rubber bands are left.\n3. Determine how many large balls can be made with the remaining rubber bands.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of rubber bands Michael has used to make the small balls. Since each small ball uses 50 rubber bands and Michael has made 22 small balls, we multiply the number of small balls by the number of rubber bands each small ball uses:\n\\[ 22 \\times 50 = 1100 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of rubber bands used from the original pack to find out how many rubber bands are left. Michael originally brought a 5,000 pack, so we subtract the 1,100 rubber bands used from 5,000:\n\\[ 5000 - 1100 = 3900 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many large balls can be made with the remaining 3,900 rubber bands. Since each large ball uses 300 rubber bands, we divide the remaining number of rubber bands by the number of rubber bands each large ball uses:\n\\[ 3900 \\div 300 = 13 \\]\n\nTherefore, Michael can make \\(\\boxed{13}\\) large balls with the remaining rubber bands.",
