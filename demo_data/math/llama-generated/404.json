        "To solve the problem, we need to determine the average number of hits per player across the next 6 games.

Therefore, each of the 10 players will have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hits per player in next 6 games} = 1 \\times 6 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the total number of hits by all the other players in the next 6 games will be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total hits by other players in next 6 games} = 10 \\times 6 = 60\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the average number of hits per player across the next 6 games:**\n   Since there are 10 other players, the average number of hits per player across the next 6 games is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average hits per player in next 6 games} = \\frac{60}{10} = 6\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of hits per player across the next 6 games is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",

The best player has 25 total hits over the first 5 games.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total hits by the other players over the first 5 games} = 75 - 25 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. There are 11 players on the team, so there are 10 other players.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average hits per game by the other players over the first 5 games} = \\frac{50}{5 \\times 10} = \\frac{50}{50} = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. If the other players continue their average over the next 6 games, the total number of hits by the other players over the next 6 games is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total hits by the other players over the next 6 games} = 1 \\times 6 \\times 10 = 60\n   \\]\n\n5. The average number of hits per player across the next 6 games is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average hits per player across the next 6 games} = \\frac{60}{10} = 6\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each player will average \\(\\boxed{6}\\) hits across the next 6 games.",
        "To determine how many hits each player will average across the next 6 games, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of hits for the first 5 games:**\n   The team has averaged 15 hits per game over their first 5 games.\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ hits/game} \\times 5 \\text{ games} = 75 \\text{ hits}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of hits by the other players in the first 5 games:**\n   The best player has 25 total hits. Therefore, the total number of hits by the other players is:\n   \\[\n   75 \\text{ hits} - 25 \\text{ hits} = 50 \\text{ hits}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the average number of hits per game by the other players in the first 5 games:**\n   There are 10 other players (since the team has 11 players in total). The average number of hits per game by the other players is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50 \\text{ hits}}{10 \\text{ players} \\times 5 \\text{ games}} = \\frac{50 \\text{ hits}}{50 \\text{ player-games}} = 1 \\text{ hit—from up_GAME}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the total number of hits by the other players in the next 6 games:**\n   If the other players continue their average of 1 hit per game restrictive the next 6 games, the total number of hits by the other players will be:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ hit/game} \\times 10 \\text{ players} \\times 6 \\text{ games} = 60 \\text{ hits}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the average number of hits per player across the next 6 games:**\n   The average number of hits per player across the next 6 games is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60 \\text{ hits}}{10 \\text{ players}} = 6 \\text{ hits/player}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the average number of hits each player will across the next 6 games is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",

        "First, we calculate the total number of hits the team has围 their first 5 games. Since the team has averaged 15 hits per game over these 5 games, we have:\n\\[\n15 \\times 5 = 75 \\text{ hits}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that the best player has 25 hits. Therefore, the total number of hits by the other 10 players over the first 5 games is:\n\\[\n75 - 25 = 50 \\text{ hits}\n\\]\n\nThe average number of hits per game by the other 10 players over the first 5 games is:\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{5} = 10 \\text{ hits per game}\n\\]\n\nIf the other players continue their average over the next 6 games, the total number of hits by the other 10 players over these 6 games will be:\n\\[\n10 \\times 6 = 60 \\text{ hits}\n\\]\n\nTo find the average number of hits per player across the next 6 games, we divide the total number of hits by the number of players:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{10} = 6 \\text{ hits per player}\n\\]\n\nThus, the average number of hits each player will average across the next 6 games is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",

Calculate the total number of hits the team has already relational the first 5 games.\n2. Determine the total number of hits the other players have over the first 5 games.\n3. Calculate the average number of hits per game for the other players over the first 5 games.\n4. Use this average to find the total number of hits the other players will have over the next 6 games.\n5. Calculate the average number of hits per player over the next 6 games.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The team has averaged 15 hits per game over their first 5 games. Therefore, the total number of hits over the first 5 games is:\n   \\[\n   15 \\times 5 = 75\n   \\]\n\n2. The best player has 25 total hits. Therefore, the total number of hits the other players have over the first 5 games is:\n   \\[\n   75 - 25 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. There are 10 other players on the team (since there are 11 players in total and one is the best player). The average number of hits per game for the other players over the first 5 games is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50}{10 \\times 5} = \\frac{50}{50} = 1\n   \\]\n\n4.

        "First, we calculate the total number of hits the team has over their first 5 games. Since the team has averaged 15 hits per game, we multiply the average by the number of games:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ hits/game} \\times 5 \\text{ games} = 75 \\text{ hits}\n\\]\nNext, we subtract the number of hits the best player has from the total hits to find the total number of hits the other 10 players have:\n\\[\n75 \\text{ hits} - 25 \\text{ hits} = 50 \\text{ hits}\n\\]\nThe other 10 players have a total of 50 hits over the first 5 games. To find their average number of hits per game, we divide the total number of hits by the number of players and then by the number of games:\n\\[\n\\frac{50 \\text{ hits}}{10 \\text{ players}} = 5 \\text{ hits/player}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{5 \\text{ hits/player}}{5 \\text{ games}} = 1 \\text{ hit/player/game}\n\\]\nThis means that each of the other players has averaged 1 hit per game over the first 5 games. If they continue this average over the next 6 games, the total number of hits each player will have across the next 6 games is:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ hit/game} \\times 6 \\text{ games} = 6 \\text{ hits}\n\\]\nTherefore, each player will average \\(\\boxed{6}\\) hits across the next 6 games in total.",
        "To determine how many hits each player will average across the next 6 games, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

The average number of hits per game by the other players over the first 5 games is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50}{5 \\times 10} = \\frac{50}{50} = 1\n   \\]\n   This means each of the other players has averaged 1 hit per game over the first 5 games.\n\n5. If the other players continue their average over the next 6 games, the total number of hits the other players will have over the next 6 games is:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 10 \\times 6 = 60\n   \\]\n\n6. The average number of hits per player over the next 6 games is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{10} = 6\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each player will average \\(\\boxed{6}\\) hits across the next 6 games in total.",

        "To determine how many hits each player will average across the next 6 games, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hits the team has over the first 5 games.\n2. Determine the total number of hits by the other players over the first 5 games.\n3. Calculate the average number of hits per game by the other players over the first 5 games.\n4. Use the average to find out how many hits the other players will have over the next 6 games.\n5. Determine the total number of hits per game by the other players over the next 6 games.\n6. Calculate the average number of hits per player over the next 6 games.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The team has averaged 15 hits per game over their first 5 games. Therefore, the total number of hits over the first 5 games is:\n   \\[\n   15 \\times 5 = 75\n   \\]\n\n2. The best player has 25 total hits. Therefore, the total number of hits by the other players over the first 5 games is:\n   \\[\n   75 - 25 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. The other players have a total of 50 hits over 5 games. Therefore, the average number of hits per game by the other players over the first 5 games is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50}{5} = 10\n   \\]\n\n4. If the other players continue their average over the next 6 games, the total number of hits by the other players over the next 6 games will be:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 6 = 60\n   \\]\n\n5. There are 10 other players on the team (since there are 11 players in total and one is the best player). Therefore, the average number of hits per player over the next 6 games is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{10} = 6\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
        "First, we need to determine the total number of hits the team has over their first 5 games. Given that the team has averaged 15 hits per game, we can calculate the total hits as follows:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ hits/game} \\times 5 \\text{ games} = 75 \\text{ hits}\n\\]\nNext, we know that their best player has 25 hits. Therefore, the total number of hits by the other 10 players over the first 5 games is:\n\\[\n75 \\text{ hits} - 25 \\text{ hits} = 50 \\text{ hits}\n\\]\nThe other 10 players have a combined total of 50 hits over the first 5 games. To find their average number of hits per player per game, we divide the total hits by the number of players and the number of games:\n\\[\n\\frac{50 \\text{ hits}}{10 \\text{ players} \\times 5 \\text{ games}} = 1 \\text{ hit/player/game}\n\\]\nIf the other players continue their average over the next 6 games, then each player will average:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ hit/player/game} \\times 6 \\text{ games} = 6 \\text{ hits/player}\n\\]\nThus, each player will average \\(\\boxed{6}\\) hits across the next 6 games.",
