        "To determine the total cups of sugar Blinky will need for the third layer of the cake, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the amount of sugar required for the smallest layer of the cake.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sugar for the smallest layer} = 2 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the amount of sugar required for the second layer, which is twice as big as the first layer.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sugar for the second layer} = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the amount of sugar required for the third layer, which is three times larger than the second layer.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sugar for the third layer} = 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cups of sugar needed for the third layer is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."
