The distance between Pence and Hillcrest on the map is \\( 3 \\frac{3}{8} \\) inches. We can express this mixed number as an improper fraction:\n\\[\n3 \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{3 \\times 8 + 3}{8} = \\frac{24 + 3}{8} = \\frac{27}{8} \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many quarters of an inch are in \\( \\frac{27}{8} \\) inches. Since \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch is equivalent to 1 quarter of an inch, we divide \\( \\frac{27}{8} \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{27}{8} \\div \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{27}{8} \\times \\frac{4}{1} = \\frac{27 \\times 4}{8 \\times 1} = \\frac{108}{8} = 13.5\n\\]\nThis means that \\( \\frac{27}{8} \\) inches is equivalent to 13.5 quarters of an inch.\n\nSince each quarter of an inch on the map represents 8 miles, we multiply 13.5 by 8 to find the actual distance:\n\\[\n13.5 \\times 8 = 108\n\\]\nTherefore, the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is \\(\\boxed{108}\\) miles.",
        "To determine the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest, we start by understanding the scale of the map. The scale given is that \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch on the map represents 8 miles in actual distance.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch segments are in \\( 3 \\frac{3}{8} \\) inches. We can convert \\( 3 \\frac{3}{8} \\) inches to an improper fraction:\n\\[ 3 \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{3 \\times 8 + 3}{8} = \\frac{24 + 3}{8} = \\frac{27}{8} \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch segments are in \\( \\frac{27}{8} \\) inches. This is done by dividing \\( \\frac{27}{8} \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\):\n\\[ \\frac{27}{8} \\div \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{27}{8} \\times \\frac{4}{1} = \\frac{27 \\times 4}{8 \\times 1} = \\frac{108}{8} = 13.5 \\]\n\nThis means there are 13.5 \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch segments in \\( 3 \\frac{3}{8} \\) inches. Since each \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch segment represents 8 miles, the actual distance is:\n\\[ 13.5 \\times 8 = 108 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is \\(\\boxed{108}\\) miles."
