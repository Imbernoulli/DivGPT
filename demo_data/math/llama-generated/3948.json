        "To determine the total number of sides on all the dice that Tom and Tim brought to school, we can break the problem down into smaller, manageable steps.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many dice Tom and Tim have together. Each of them brought 4 dice, so we add the number of dice Tom has to the number of dice Tim has:\n\\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \\]\nSo, Tom and Tim together have 8 dice.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many sides there are on all 8 dice. Since each die is a six-sided die, we multiply the number of dice by the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\]\nSo, the total number of sides on all the dice is:\n\\[ \\boxed{48} \\]",
