Determine the total number of athletes in the camp at the end of Sunday morning.\n4. Find the difference between the number of athletes on Saturday night and the number of athletes on Sunday morning.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of athletes who left the camp on Sunday morning.**\n\nThe athletes left at a rate of 28 athletes per hour for 4 hours. Therefore, the total number of athletes who left is:\n\\[ 28 \\times 4 = 112 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of athletes who arrived at the camp on Sunday morning.**\n\nThe athletes arrived at a rate of 15 athletes per hour for 7 hours. Therefore, the total number of athletes who arrived is:\n\\[ 15 \\times 7 = 105 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total number of athletes in the camp at the end of Sunday morning.**\n\nStarting with 300 athletes on Saturday night, after 112 athletes left and 105 athletes arrived, the number of athletes in the camp at the end of Sunday morning is:\n\\[ 300 - 112 + 105 = 293 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the difference between the number of athletes on Saturday night and the number of athletes on Sunday morning.**\n\nThe difference is:\n\\[ 300 - 293 = 7 \\]\n\nThus, the difference in the total number of athletes in the camp over the two nights is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]",

After 112 athletes left and 105 athletes arrived, the number of athletes on Sunday night is:\n\\[ 300 - 112 + 105 = 293 \\]\nSo, there are 293 athletes in the camp on Sunday night.\n\n**Step 4: Find the difference between the number of athletes on Saturday night and Sunday night.**\n\nThe difference is:\n\\[ 300 - 293 = 7 \\]\nSo, the difference in the total number of athletes in the camp over the two nights is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]",

Calculate the number of athletes who arrived at the camp.\n3. Determine the final number of athletes in the camp after all Arrivals and leaving.\n4. Find the difference between the initial number of athletes and the final number of athletes.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of athletes who left the camp.**\n\nThe athletes left the camp at a rate of 28 athletes per hour for 4 hours. Therefore, the total number of athletes who left is:\n\\[ 28 \\times 4 = 112 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of athletes who arrived at the camp.**\n\nThe athletes arrived at the camp at a rate of 15 athletes per hour for 7 hours. Therefore, the total number of athletes who arrived is:\n\\[ 15 \\times 7 = 105 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final number of athletes in the camp after all Arrivals and leaving.**\n\nThe initial number of athletes in the camp was 300. After 112 athletes left and 105 athletes arrived, the final number of athletes in the camp is:\n\\[ 300 - 112 + 105 = 293 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the difference between the initial number of athletes and the final number of athletes.**\n\nThe difference in the total number of athletes in the camp over the two nights is:\n\\[ 300 - 293 = 7 \\]\n\nThus, the difference in the total number of athletes in the camp over the two nights is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
        "To determine the difference in the total number of athletes in the camp over the two nights, we need to calculate the number of athletes remaining in the camp after they leave and then the number of athletes attempting to enter the camp and add those to the remaining athletes.\n\n Initially, there are 300 athletes at the camp. Over the next 4 hours, they leave at a rate of 28 athletes per hour. The total number of athletes who leave is:\n\\[ 28 \\text{ athletes/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 112 \\text{ athletes} \\]\nSo, the number of athletes remaining after 4 hours is:\n\\[ 300 - 112 = 188 \\text{ athletes} \\]\n\nNext, over the following 7 hours, a new group of athletes trickles into the camp at a rate of 15 athletes per hour. The total number of athletes who enter is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ athletes/hour} \\times 7 \\text{ hours} = 105 \\text{ athletes} \\]\nSo, the total number of athletes in the camp after the new athletes enter is:\n\\[ 188 + 105 = 293 \\text{ athletes} \\]\n\nThe difference in the total number of athletes in the camp over the two nights is:\n\\[ 300 - 293 = 7 \\]\n\nThus, the difference in the total number of athletes in the camp over the two nights is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."
