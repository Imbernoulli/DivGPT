Violet needs 800 ml of water per hour and her dog needs 400 ml of water per hour, so together they need:\n\\[ 800 \\text{ ml} + 400 \\text{ ml} = 1200 \\text{ ml} \\text{ per hour} \\]\n\nNow, we determine how many hours they can hike by dividing the total amount of water Violet can carry by the amount of water they consume per hour:\n\\[ \\frac{4800 \\text{ ml}}{1200 \\text{ ml per hour}} = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, Violet and her dog can spend \\(\\boxed{4}\\) hours hiking.",
