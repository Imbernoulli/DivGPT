        "To determine Diana's total earnings over the three months, we need to calculate her earnings for each month and then sum them up.\n\n1. Diana's earnings in July are given as $150.\n2. Diana's earnings in August are 3 times her earnings in July. Therefore, her earnings in August are:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 150 = 450\n   \\]\n3. Diana's earnings in September are twice her earnings in August. Therefore, her earnings in September are:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 450 = 900\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up her earnings for July, August, and September:\n\\[\n150 + 450 + 900 = 1500\n\\]\n\nThus, Diana's total earnings over these three months is \\boxed{1500}.",
        "To determine how much money Diana earned over the three months, we need to calculate her earnings for each month and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Diana's earnings in August:\nDiana earned $150 in July. Since she earned 3 times this amount in August, we multiply $150 by 3:\n\\[ 150 \\times 3 = 450 \\]\nSo, Diana earned $450 in August.\n\nNext, let's calculate Diana's earnings in September:\nDiana earned twice the money she earned in August. Since she earned $450 in August, we multiply $450 by 2:\n\\[ 450 \\times 2 = 900 \\]\nSo, Diana earned $900 in September.\n\nNow, let's sum up Diana's earnings for July, August, and September:\n\\[ 150 + 450 + 900 = 1500 \\]\nSo, Diana earned a total of $1500 over these three months.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1500} \\]",
