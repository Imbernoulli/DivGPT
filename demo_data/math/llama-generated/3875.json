        "Let's denote the total number of items on the math quiz as \\( x \\). Since Louie obtained 80% on the quiz, it means he answered 80% of the items correctly. Therefore, he answered \\( 0.8x \\) items correctly.\n\nWe know that Louie had 5 mistakes, which means he answered \\( x - 5 \\) items correctly. So, we can set up the following equation to represent the number of items he answered correctly:\n\\[ 0.8x = x - 5 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by isolating \\( x \\) on one side of the equation.

Use the percentage of mistakes to find out how many items he got correct.\n3. Set up an equation to find the total number of items on the quiz.\n\nFirst, let's find out what percentage of the quiz Louie got correct. Since he made 5 mistakes, he got \\(100\\% - 80\\% = 20\\%\\) wrong. This means he got 80% correct.\n\nNext, let's denote the total number of items on the quiz by \\(x\\). Since Louie got 80% correct, the number of items he got correct is \\(0.8x\\). We also know that the number of items he got correct is the total number of items minus the number of mistakes he made, which is \\(x - 5\\).\n\nWe can now set up the following equation:\n\\[0.8x = x - 5\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), we first isolate \\(x\\) by subtracting \\(0.8x\\) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[0.8x - 0.8x = x - 0.8x - 5\\]\n\\[0 = 0.2x - 5\\]\n\\[5 = 0.2x\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.2:\n\\[x = \\frac{5}{0.2}\\]\n\\[x = 25\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of items on the math quiz is \\(\\boxed{25}\\)."
