Therefore, the number of dreams he has had this year is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 365 = 1460\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Gavin had twice as many dreams last year as he had this year. So, the number of dreams he had last year is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 1460 = 2920\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of dreams from this year and last year to get the total number of dreams he has had in the two years:\n\\[\n1460 + 2920 = 4380\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of dreams Gavin has had in the two years is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4380}\n\\]",
