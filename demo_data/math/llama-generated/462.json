Therefore, the cost per lollipop is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per lollipop} = \\frac{3 \\text{ dollars}}{12 \\text{ lollipops}} = 0.25 \\text{ dollars per lollipop}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many lollipops Sarah shared with Julie. Sarah offered to share one-quarter of the lollipops:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of lollipops shared} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3 \\text{ lollipops}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of the lollipops shared. Since each lollipop costs 0.25 dollars, the total cost for 3 lollipops is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of lollipops shared} = 3 \\text{ lollipops} \\times 0.25 \\text{ dollars per lollipop} = 0.75 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we convert the total cost from dollars to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we have:\n\\[\n0.75 \\text{ dollars} = 0.75 \\times 100 = 75 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nThus, Julie gave Sarah \\(\\boxed{75}\\) cents to pay for the shared lollipops.",
        "To determine how much money Julie gave Sarah to pay for the shared lollipops, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost per lollipop:**\n   Sarah bought 12 lollipops for a total of 3 dollars.
