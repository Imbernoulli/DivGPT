        "To determine the number of letters in Samantha's last name, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the length of Jamie's last name.\n2. Use the information about Bobbie's last name to find its length.\n3. Use the information about Samantha's last name to find its length.\n\nFirst, we know Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey. Therefore, the length of Jamie's last name \"Grey\" is 4 letters.\n\nNext, we are told that if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie's. Since Jamie's last name is 4 letters long, twice that length is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ letters} \\]\n\nThis means that if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have 8 letters left. Therefore, the original length of Bobbie's last name is:\n\\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \\text{ letters} \\]\n\nWe are also told that Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's last name. Since Bobbie's last name is 10 letters long, Samantha's last name is:\n\\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \\text{ letters} \\]\n\nThus, the number of letters in Samantha's last name is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]",
