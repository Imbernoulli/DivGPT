        "To determine the cost of running John's new computer for 50 hours after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the power consumption of the new computer:**\n   - The old computer uses 800 watts.\n   - The new computer uses 50% more power than the old computer.\n   - First, find 50% of the old computer's power consumption:\n     \\[\n     0.50 \\times 800 = 400 \\text{ watts}\n     \\]\n   - Add this to the old computer's power consumption to get the new computer's power consumption:\n     \\[\n     800 + 400 = 1200 \\text{ watts}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the power consumption from watts to kilowatts:**\n   - There are 1000 watts in a kilowatt.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1200 \\text{ watts}}{1000} = 1.2 \\text{ kilowatts}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the new price of electricity:**\n   - The old price of electricity was 12 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n   - The price increased by 25%.\n   - First, find 25% of the old price:\n     \\[\n     0.25 \\times 12 = 3 \\text{ cents per kilowatt-hour}\n     \\]\n   - Add this to the old price to get the new price:\n     \\[\n     12 + 3 = 15 \\text{ cents per kilowatt-hour}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost to run the new computer for 50 hours:**\n   - The new computer uses 1.2 kilowatts per hour.\n   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is 15 cents.\n   - Multiply the power consumption by the price per kilowatt-hour and then by the number of hours:\n     \\[\n     1.2 \\text{ kilowatts/hour} \\times 15 \\text{ cents/kilowatt-hour} \\times 50 \\text{ hours} = 900 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Convert the total cost from cents to dollars:**\n   - There are 100 cents in a dollar.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{900 \\text{ cents}}{100} = 9 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost to run John's new computer for 50 hours is \\(\\boxed{9}\\) dollars.",

Therefore, we calculate the power consumption of the new computer as follows:\n\\[ 800 \\text{ watts} + 0.5 \\times 800 \\text{ watts} = 800 \\text{ watts} + 400 \\text{ watts} = 1200 \\text{ watts} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the new price of electricity.**\n\nThe old price of electricity was 12 cents per kilowatt-hour. Since 1 kilowatt-hour is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the old price to cents per watt-hour:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ cents per kilowatt-hour} = 12 \\text{ cents per } 1000 \\text{ watts} = 0.012 \\text{ cents per watt} \\]\n\nThe price of electricity went up by 25%.
