        "To determine how old Lucas will be three years from now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out Billy's current age.\n2. Use Billy's age to find Lucas's current age.\n3. Determine Lucas's age three years from now.\n\nFirst, we know that Gladys is 30 years old now. According to the problem, Billy is 3 times younger than Gladys. This means Billy's age is:\n\\[\n\\text{Billy's age} = \\frac{30}{3} = 10 \\text{ years old}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that the age of Gladys is equal to twice the sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas. We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship:\n\\[\n30 = 2(\\text{Billy's age} + \\text{Lucas's age})\n\\]\nSubstituting Billy's age into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n30 = 2(10 + \\text{Lucas's age})\n\\]\nSimplify the equation inside the parentheses:\n\\[\n30 = 2 \\times (10 + \\text{Lucas's age}) = 20 + 2 \\times \\text{Lucas's age}\n\\]\nTo isolate Lucas's age, subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n30 - 20 = 2 \\times \\text{Lucas's age}\n\\]\n\\[\n10 = 2 \\times \\text{Lucas's age}\n\\]\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Lucas's age} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ years old}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how old Lucas will be three years from now. Add 3 to Lucas's current age:\n\\[\n\\text{Lucas's age in 3 years} = 5 + 3 = 8 \\text{ years old}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Lucas will be \\boxed{8} years old three years from now.",

Let's denote Lucas's current age by \\( L \\).

Let's denote Lucas's current age by \\( L \\). Then, we can write the equation for Gladys's age as:\n\n\\[\n30 = 2 \\times (10 + L)\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( L \\), we first simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n30 = 20 + 2L\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( L \\) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n10 = 2L\n\\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( L \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nL = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, Lucas is currently 5 years old.
