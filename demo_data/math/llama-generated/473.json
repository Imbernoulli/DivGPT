        "To determine how many more weeks Rex will need to continue taking lessons to reach his goal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of hours Rex covered in the first 6 weeks:**\n   - Rex has two-hour sessions twice a week.\n   - Therefore, the number of hours per week is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ sessions/week} \\times 2 \\text{ hours/session} = 4 \\text{ hours/week}\n     \\]\n   - Over 6 weeks, the total number of hours is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 6 \\text{ weeks} = 24 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the remaining number of hours Rex needs:**\n   - Rex's goal is to take 40 hour-long lessons.\n   - He has already completed 24 hours.\n   - The remaining number of hours is:\n     \\[\n     40 \\text{ hours} - 24 \\text{ hours} = 16 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of weeks Rex needs to complete the remaining hours:**\n   - Rex cofers 4 hours per week.\n   - To find the number of weeks needed for the remaining 16 hours, we divide the remaining hours by the hours per week:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{16 \\text{ hours}}{4 \\text{ hours/week}} = 4 \\text{ weeks}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Rex will need to continue taking lessons for \\boxed{4} more weeks to reach his goal.",
