They make the playoffs by having the top three highest points for their records. Teams get 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, and zero points for a loss. The first-place team has 12 wins and 4 ties. The second-place team has 13 wins and 1 tie. Elsa's team has 8 wins and 10 ties. What is the average number of points for the playoff teams?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
