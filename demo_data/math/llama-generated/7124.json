        "To determine John's total pay this year including his bonus, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the bonus percentage:**\n   John received a $10,000 bonus on a $100,000 salary last year. We can find the bonus percentage by dividing the bonus by the salary and then multiplying by 100:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bonus Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{10,000}{100,000} \\right) \\times 100 = 10\\%\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine this year's bonus:**\n   This year John makes $200,000. Since the bonus is 10% of his salary, we calculate the bonus as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{This Year's Bonus} = 10\\% \\times 200,000 = 0.10 \\times 200,000 = 20,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate this year's total pay:**\n   To find John's total pay this year, we add his salary to his bonus:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Pay} = \\text{Salary} + \\text{Bonus} = 200,000 + 20,000 = 220,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, John will make \\(\\boxed{220000}\\) this year when adding both his total pay and bonus together.",

We can calculate this year's bonus as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{This year's bonus} = 10\\% \\times 200000 = 0.10 \\times 200000 = 20000\n\\]\n\nNext, we add this year's bonus to John's total pay to find his total earnings for this year:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings} = \\text{Total Pay} + \\text{Bonus} = 200000 + 20000 = 220000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, John will make \\(\\boxed{220000}\\) this year when adding both his total pay and bonus together.",
