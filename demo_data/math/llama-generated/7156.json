        "To find the weight of Carl, we need to determine the weights of Al and Ben first using the information given about Ed's weight and the relationships between the weights of Al, Ben, and Carl.\n\n1. **Determine Al's weight:**\n   Ed weighs 146 pounds and is 38 pounds lighter than Al. Therefore, we can find Al's weight by adding 38 pounds to Ed's weight:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Al's weight} = 146 + 38 = 184 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Ben's weight:**\n   Al is 25 pounds heavier than Ben.
