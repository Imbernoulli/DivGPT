Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of eggs produced by the chickens in one week. The farmer has 46 chickens, and each chicken gives him 6 eggs a week:\n\\[ 46 \\text{ chickens} \\times 6 \\text{ eggs/chicken/week} = 276 \\text{ eggs/week} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the total number of eggs produced in 8 weeks:\n\\[ 276 \\text{ eggs/week} \\times 8 \\text{ weeks} = 2208 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nThen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:\n\\[ 2208 \\text{ eggs} \\div 12 \\text{ eggs/dozen} = 184 \\text{ dozens} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. The farmer sells a dozen eggs for $3, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:\n\\[ 184 \\text{ dozens} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/dozen} = 552 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the farmer would make in 8 weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{552} \\]",
