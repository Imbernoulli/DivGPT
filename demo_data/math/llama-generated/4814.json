        "To determine how many fried chickens Steph can make, we need to consider the total number of chicken pieces she has. The chicken pieces come in two forms: drumsticks and breast parts.\n\nFirst, we know that Steph bought 24 drumsticks. She also bought 4 fewer breast parts than drumsticks. Therefore, we can calculate the number of breast parts as follows:\n\\[ 24 - 4 = 20 \\]\nSo, Steph has 20 breast parts.\n\nNext, we add the number of drumsticks and breast parts to find the total number of chicken pieces:\n\\[ 24 + 20 = 44 \\]\nTherefore, Steph can make \\(\\boxed{44}\\) fried chickens.",
