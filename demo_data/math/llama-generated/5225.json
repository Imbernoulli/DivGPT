        "To determine how many pages Tom reads in 7 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of hours Tom reads in 7 days:**\n   Tom reads 10 hours over 5 days. To find out how many hours he reads per day, we divide the total hours by the number of days:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hours per day} = \\frac{10 \\text{ hours}}{5 \\text{ days}} = 2 \\text{ hours per day}\n   \\]\n   Now, to find out how many hours he reads in 7 days, we multiply the hours per day by the number of days:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total hours in 7 days} = 2 \\text{ hours per day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 14 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of pages Tom reads in 14 hours:**\n   Tom reads 50 pages per hour. To find out how many pages he reads in 14 hours, we multiply the number of pages per hour by the total hours:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pages in 14 hours} = 50 \\text{ pages per hour} \\times 14 \\text{ hours} = 700 \\text{ pages}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages Tom reads in 7 days is \\boxed{700}.",
