        "To determine the total number of pieces of clothes Eliza ironed, we need to calculate the number of blouses and dresses she ironed separately and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of blouses Eliza ironed:\n- Eliza spends 2 hours ironing blouses.\n- Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2 hours is equal to \\(2 \\times 60 = 120\\) minutes.\n- Eliza takes 15 minutes to iron one blouse.\n- Therefore, the number of blouses she ironed is \\(120 \\div 15 = 8\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of dresses Eliza ironed:\n- Eliza spends 3 hours ironing dresses.\n- Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to \\(3 \\times 60 = 180\\) minutes.\n- Eliza takes 20 minutes to iron one dress.\n- Therefore, the number of dresses she ironed is \\(180 \\div 20 = 9\\).\n\nNow, we sum the number of blouses and dresses to find the total number of pieces of clothes ironed:\n- The total number of pieces of clothes is \\(8 + 9 = 17\\).\n\nThus, the total number of pieces of clothes Eliza ironed is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",
