In two weeks, his usual number of chores is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ chores/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 24 \\text{ chores} \\]\n\nThe number of extra chores he does is:\n\\[ 56 \\text{ chores} - 24 \\text{ chores} = 32 \\text{ extra chores} \\]\n\nSince his parents pay him $2 for each extra chore, the total amount of money he earns is:\n\\[ 32 \\text{ extra chores} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/extra chore} = 64 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Edmund earns is:\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]",

        "To determine how much Edmund earns, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of chores Edmund does in two weeks.\n2. Determine how many extra chores he does in two weeks.\n3. Calculate how much he earns from the extra chores.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of chores Edmund does in two weeks. He does 4 chores a day for 14 days (two weeks):\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ chores/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 56 \\text{ chores}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many extra chores he does in two weeks. He normally has to do 12 chores a week. Therefore, in two weeks, he normally does:\n\n\\[\n12 \\text{ chores/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 24 \\text{ chores}\n\\]\n\nThe number of extra chores he does is the total number of chores he does minus the number of chores he normally does:\n\n\\[\n56 \\text{ chores} - 24 \\text{ chores} = 32 \\text{ extra chores}\n\\]\n\nSince his parents pay him $2 for each extra chore, the total amount he earns from the extra chores is:\n\n\\[\n32 \\text{ extra chores} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/extra chore} = 64 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Edmund earns is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{64}\n\\]",
        "First, we need to determine the total number of chores Edmund does in two weeks if he does 4 chores a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, in two weeks there are \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\) days. If he does 4 chores each day, then in two weeks he does \\(4 \\times 14 = 56\\) chores.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many extra chores he does compared to his normal weekly total. His normal weekly total is 12 chores, so in two weeks his normal total is \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\) chores. The number of extra chores he does is \\(56 - 24 = 32\\).\n\nSince his parents pay him $2 for each extra chore, the total amount he earns is \\(32 \\times 2 = 64\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the amount Edmund earns is \\(\\boxed{64}\\).",
        "To determine how much Edmund earns, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of chores Edmund does in two weeks:**\n   - Edmund does 4 chores per day.\n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - Therefore, in one week, he does:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ chores/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 28 \\text{ chores/week}\n     \\]\n   - Over two weeks, he does:\n     \\[\n     28 \\text{ chores/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 56 \\text{ chores}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many extra chores Edmund does:**\n   - tapping 12 chores per week is his normal requirement.\n   - Over two weeks, his normal requirement is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ chores/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 24 \\text{ chores}\n     \\]\n   - The number of extra chores he does is:\n     \\[\n     56 \\text{ chores} - 24 \\text{ chores} = 32 \\text{ extra chores}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how much Edmund earns for the extra chores:**\n   - His parents pay him $2 for each extra chore.\n   - Therefore, for 32 extra chores, he earns:\n     \\[\n     32 \\text{ extra chores} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/extra chore} = 64 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Edmund earns is \\(\\boxed{64}\\) dollars."
