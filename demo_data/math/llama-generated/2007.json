        "To determine how long it would take for one kid to wash six whiteboards, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the rate at which the four kids wash whiteboards:**\n   - Four kids can wash three whiteboards in 20 minutes.\n   - Therefore, the total work done by four kids in 20 minutes is 3 whiteboards.\n\n2. **Determine the work rate per kid per minute:**\n   - First, find the total work done by one kid in 20 minutes.\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3 \\text{ whiteboards}}{4 \\text{ kids}} = 0.75 \\text{ whiteboards per kid in 20 minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Next, find the work rate per kid per minute.\n     \\[\n     \\frac{0.75 \\text{ whiteboards}}{20 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.0375 \\text{ whiteboards per kid per minute}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total time it takes for one kid to wash six whiteboards:**\n   - We need to find \\( t \\) such that one kid washes six whiteboards.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Work rate per kid per minute} \\times t = 6 \\text{ whiteboards}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the work rate per kid per minute into the equation.\n     \\[\n     0.0375 \\text{ whiteboards per kid per minute} \\times t = 6 \\text{ whiteboards}\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( t \\).\n     \\[\n     t = \\frac{6 \\text{ whiteboards}}{0.0375 \\text{ whiteboards per kid per minute}} = 160 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, it would take one kid \\(\\boxed{160}\\) minutes to wash six whiteboards.",
