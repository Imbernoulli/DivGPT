        "To determine how many days ago the ship should have departed, we need to sum up the time it takes for the cargo to travel from Shanghai to the warehouse and then work backwards from the expected arrival date.\n\n1. The cargo ship navigates for 21 days.\n2. Customs and regulatory processes in Vancouver last 4 days.\n3. Moving the cargo from the port to the warehouse takes 7 days.\n4. The warehouse is expecting the shipment 2 days from today.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total time from the departure of the ship to the arrival at the warehouse:\n\\[ 21 \\text{ days} + 4 \\text{ days} + 7 \\text{ days} = 32 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSince the warehouse is expecting the shipment 2 days from today, we need to find out how many days ago the ship should have departed to ensure the shipment arrives 2 days from now. This means the total time from the departure to today is:\n\\[ 32 \\text{ days} - 2 \\text{ days} = 30 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, the ship should have departed \\(\\boxed{30}\\) days ago.",
