        "To determine how much the paying students pay for lunch, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of students who receive free lunch:**\n   Given that 40% of the students receive a free lunch, we can find this number by multiplying the total number of students by 40%.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students receiving free lunch} = 0.40 \\times 50 = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of paying students:**\n   The total number of students is 50, and 20 of them receive free lunch. Therefore, the number of paying students is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of paying students} = 50 - 20 = 30\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of feeding all students:**\n   The total cost to feed 50 students is given as $210.\n\n4. **Determine the amount each paying student should pay:**\n   To find out how much each paying student should pay, we divide the total cost by the number of paying students:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount each paying student pays} = \\frac{210}{30} = 7\n   \\]\n\nThus, each paying student pays \\(\\boxed{7}\\) dollars for lunch.",

Calculate the number of paying students.\n3. Determine the total cost of feeding all students.\n4. Calculate the amount each paying student pays.\n\nFirst, we find the number of students who receive a free lunch. Since 40% of the students receive a free lunch, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 50 = 20\n\\]\nSo, 20 students receive a free lunch.\n\nNext, we find the number of paying students. Since there are 50 students in total and 20 receive a free lunch, the number of paying students is:\n\\[\n50 - 20 = 30\n\\]\n\nThe total cost to feed all 50 students is $210. This cost is covered entirely by the paying students. Therefore, the amount each paying student pays is:\n\\[\n\\frac{210}{30} = 7\n\\]\n\nSo, each paying student pays \\(\\boxed{7}\\) dollars for lunch.",
