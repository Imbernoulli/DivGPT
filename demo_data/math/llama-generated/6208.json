        "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Mark starts the day with 14 buttons.\n2. Shane gives Mark 3 times the amount of buttons Mark originally had. So, Shane gives Mark \\(3 \\times 14 = 42\\) buttons.\n3. After receiving the buttons from Shane, Mark now has \\(14 + 42 = 56\\) buttons.\n4. Sam asks Mark if he can have half of Mark's buttons. So, Sam gets \\(\\frac{56}{2} = 28\\) buttons.\n5. After giving Sam his buttons, Mark has \\(56 - 28 = 28\\) buttons left.\n\nTherefore, the number of buttons Mark ends up with is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
        "Let's start by determining how many buttons Mark had after Shane gave him more buttons. Mark initially had 14 buttons. Shane gave him 3 times that amount of buttons, so we calculate:\n\n\\[ 14 \\times 3 = 42 \\]\n\nAdding these buttons to Mark's initial amount, we get:\n\n\\[ 14 + 42 = 56 \\]\n\nNext, Sam asked for half of Mark's buttons. So, we need to find half of 56:\n\n\\[ 56 \\div 2 = 28 \\]\n\nAfter giving Sam half of his buttons, Mark is left with:\n\n\\[ 56 - 28 = 28 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of buttons Mark ended up with is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
