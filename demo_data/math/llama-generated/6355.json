        "To determine how much change Mr. Arevalo will receive, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the food.\n2. Calculate the service charge.\n3. Calculate the tip.\n4. Add the total cost of the food, the service charge, and the tip to get the total bill.\n5. Subtract the total bill from Mr. Arevalo's $100 to find the change.\n\nLet's start with the total cost of the food:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost of food} = 40 + 15 + 25 = 80 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the service charge. The service charge is 10% of the total cost of the food:\n\\[ \\text{Service charge} = 0.10 \\times 80 = 8 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the tip. The tip is 5% of the total cost of the food:\n\\[ \\text{Tip} = 0.05 \\times 80 = 4 \\]\n\nNow, we add the total cost of the food, the service charge, and the tip to get the total bill:\n\\[ \\text{Total bill} = 80 + 8 + 4 = 92 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total bill from Mr. Arevalo's $100 to find the change:\n\\[ \\text{Change} = 100 - 92 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the change Mr. Arevalo will receive is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
