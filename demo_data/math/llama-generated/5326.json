Find out how much floss is left over.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of floss needed.**\n\nThere are 20 students, and each student needs 1.5 yards of floss. So, the total amount of floss needed is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 1.5 = 30 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many packets of floss Dikembe should buy.**\n\nEach packet contains 35 yards of floss. Since Dikembe needs 30 yards and he cannot buy a fraction of a packet, he should buy the smallest whole number of packets that is greater than or equal to the total amount needed. In this case, he needs only 1 packet because:\n\\[ \\frac{30}{35} = 0.8571 \\]\nSince he cannot buy 0.8571 packets, he buys 1 packet.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of floss Dikembe buys.**\n\nIf Dikembe buys 1 packet, he buys:\n\\[ 1 \\times 35 = 35 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find out how much floss is left over.**\n\nTo find out how much floss is left over, we subtract the total amount of floss needed from the total amount of floss Dikembe buys:\n\\[ 35 - 30 = 5 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of floss left over is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]",

So, Dikembe needs to buy 1 packet.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of floss he buys.**\n\nSince he buys 1 packet and each packet contains 35 yards, the total amount of floss he buys is:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ packet} \\times 35 \\text{ yards/packet} = 35 \\text{ yards}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Find out how much floss is left over.**\n\nTo find out how much floss is left over, we subtract the total amount of floss needed from the total amount of floss bought:\n\\[\n35 \\text{ yards} - 30 \\text{ yards} = 5 \\text{ yards}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of floss left over is \\boxed{5}.",
