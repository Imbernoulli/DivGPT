        "To determine how many tennis balls Brian has, we need to follow the information given step by step.\n\n1. Identify how many tennis balls Lily has.\n   Lily has 3 tennis balls.\n\n2. Determine how many tennis balls Frodo has.\n   Frodo has 8 more tennis balls than Lily. So, we add 8 to the number of tennis balls Lily has:\n   \\[\n   3 + 8 = 11\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Frodo has 11 tennis balls.\n\n3. Determine how many tennis balls Brian has.\n   Brian has twice as many tennis balls as Frodo. So, we multiply the number of tennis balls Frodo has by 2:\n   \\[\n   11 \\times 2 = 22\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Brian has 22 tennis balls.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",

Finally, we are told that Brian has twice as many tennis balls as Frodo. Therefore, we can calculate the number of tennis balls Brian has by multiplying the number of tennis balls Frodo has by 2.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brian's tennis balls} = 2 \\times \\text{Frodo's tennis balls} = 2 \\times 11 = 22\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of tennis balls Brian has is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",
        "To determine how many tennis balls Brian has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find out how many tennis balls Frodo has:**\n   - Lily has 3 tennis balls.\n   - Frodo has 8 more tennis balls than Lily.\n   - Therefore, Frodo's tennis balls can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     3 + 8 = 11\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many tennis balls Brian has:**\n   - Brian has twice as many tennis balls as Frodo.\n   - Since Frodo has 11 tennis balls, Brian's tennis balls can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 11 = 22\n     \\]\n\nThus, Brian has \\(\\boxed{22}\\) tennis balls.",
