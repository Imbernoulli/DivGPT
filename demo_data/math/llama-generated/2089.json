        "To determine how many meters from the beach the fourth buoy is, we need to first find out the distance between each buoy. We know that the third buoy is 72 meters from the beach. Since the buoys are placed at even intervals, the distance between each buoy is the same. Let's denote this distance by \\( d \\).\n\nThe third buoy is located at a distance of \\( 3d \\) from the beach. According to the problem, this distance is 72 meters. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 3d = 72 \\]\n\nTo find \\( d \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ d = \\frac{72}{3} = 24 \\]\n\nSo, the distance between each buoy is 24 meters. The fourth buoy is located at a distance of \\( 4d \\) from the beach.
