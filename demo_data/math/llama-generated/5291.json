        "To determine the value of one of the other toys, we start by noting the total value of all 9 toys and the value of one specific toy. The total value of all 9 toys is $52, and one toy is worth $12. First, we subtract the value of the $12 toy from the total value to find the combined value of the remaining 8 toys.\n\n\\[ 52 - 12 = 40 \\]\n\nThis calculation tells us that the total value of the remaining 8 toys is $40. Since all the other 8 toys have the same value, we can find the value of one of these toys by dividing the total value of the 8 toys by 8.\n\n\\[ 40 \\div 8 = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of one of the other toys is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
