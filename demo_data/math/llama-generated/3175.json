        "To determine how many years it took Bob to grow his hair from 6 inches to 36 inches, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total growth of Bob's hair.\n2. Determine the time it took for this growth in months.\n3. Convert the time from months to years.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total growth of Bob's hair. His hair is now 36 inches long, and he cut it to 6 inches last time. So, the total growth is:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ inches} - 6 \\text{ inches} = 30 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNext, we know that hair grows at a rate of 0.5 inches per month. To find out how many months it took for Bob's hair to grow 30 inches, we divide the total growth by the growth rate:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ inches} \\div 0.5 \\text{ inches/month} = 60 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nFinally, we need to convert the time from months to years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we divide the number of months by 12:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ months} \\div 12 \\text{ months/year} = 5 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nTherefore, it took Bob \\(\\boxed{5}\\) years to grow out his hair.",
