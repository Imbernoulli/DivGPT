Calculate the points scored by Sean.\n4. Sum the points scored by all three players.\n\nFirst, we know that Tobee scored 4 points.\n\\[ \\text{Tobee's points} = 4 \\]\n\nNext, Jay scored 6 more points than Tobee.\n\\[ \\text{Jay's points} = \\text{Tobee's points} + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 \\]\n\nThen, Sean scored 2 less than the sum of the points scored by Tobee and Jay.\n\\[ \\text{Sean's points} = (\\text{Tobee's points} + \\text{Jay's points}) - 2 = (4 + 10) - 2 = 14 - 2 = 12 \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the points scored by Tobee, Jay, and Sean.\n\\[ \\text{Total points} = \\text{Tobee's points} + \\text{Jay's points} + \\text{Sean's points} = 4 + 10 + 12 = 26 \\]\n\nThus, the total points scored by Tobee, Jay, and Sean for their team is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).",
