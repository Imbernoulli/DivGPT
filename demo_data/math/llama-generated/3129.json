The 5 players, including Jess, play 5 rounds in which each player removes one block. In the sixth round, Jess's father goes first. He removes a block, causing the tower to almost fall. Next, Jess tries to remove another block knocking down the tower. How many blocks did the tower have before Jess's turn?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Therefore, in 5 rounds, the total number of blocks removed is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ blocks/round} \\times 5 \\text{ rounds} = 25 \\text{ blocks} \\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the blocks removed in the sixth round before Jess's turn. Jess's father goes first and removes one block, so after his turn, the number of blocks removed in the sixth round is 1. Therefore, the total number of blocks removed before Jess's turn is:\n\\[ 25 \\text{ blocks} + 1 \\text{ block} = 26 \\text{ blocks} \\]\n\nSince the original number of blocks in the tower was 54, the number of blocks left in the tower before Jess's turn is:\n\\[ 54 \\text{ blocks} - 26 \\text{ blocks} = 28 \\text{ blocks} \\]\n\nThus, the number of blocks in the tower before Jess's turn is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
