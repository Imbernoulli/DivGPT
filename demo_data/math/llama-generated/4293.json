Subtract the total number of pythons and boa constrictors from the total number of snakes to find the number of rattlesnakes.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- There are 40 boa constrictors.\n- There are three times as many pythons as boa constrictors.\n- The total number of snakes in the park is 200.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of pythons:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pythons} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of boa constrictors} = 3 \\times 40 = 120\n\\]\n\nNext, find the total number of pythons and boa constrictors combined:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of pythons and boa constrictors} = \\text{Number of pythons} + \\text{Number of boa constrictors} = 120 + 40 = 160\n\\]\n\nFinally, subtract the total number of pythons and boa constrictors from the total number of snakes to find the number of rattlesnakes:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of rattlesnakes} = \\text{Total number of snakes} - \\text{Total number of pythons and boa constrictors} = 200 - 160 = 40\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of rattlesnakes in the park is \\boxed{40}.",
