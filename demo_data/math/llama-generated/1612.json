        "To determine the total number of caps the factory will make, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of caps made in the first three weeks.\n2. Find the average number of caps made per week over the first three weeks.\n3. Use the average to find out how many caps are made in the fourth week.\n4. Add the number of caps made in the fourth week to the total number of caps made in the first three weeks.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The total number of caps made in the first three weeks is:\n\\[ 320 + 400 + 300 = 1020 \\]\n\nNext, we find the average number of caps made per week over the first three weeks. The average is calculated by dividing the total number of caps by the number of weeks:\n\\[ \\frac{1020}{3} = 340 \\]\n\nSo, the factory makes 340 caps in the fourth week. Now, we add the number of caps made in the fourth week to the total number of caps made in the first three weeks to find the total number of caps made over the four weeks:\n\\[ 1020 + 340 = 1360 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of caps the factory will make is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1360} \\]",
