        "To determine the total number of chairs in the classroom, we start by identifying the number of each type of chair.\n\nFirst, we know there are 10 blue chairs. Let's denote the number of blue chairs as \\( B \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ B = 10 \\]\n\nNext, we know that the number of green chairs is 3 times the number of blue chairs. Let's denote the number of green chairs as \\( G \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ G = 3B = 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\]\n\nThen, we know that the number of white chairs is 13 fewer than the combined total of the green and blue chairs. Let's denote the number of white chairs as \\( W \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ W = G + B - 13 = 30 + 10 - 13 = 27 \\]\n\nNow, to find the total number of chairs in the classroom, we add the number of blue chairs, green chairs, and white chairs together:\n\\[ B + G + W = 10 + 30 + 27 = 67 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of chairs in the classroom is:\n\\[ \\boxed{67} \\]",

Sum the number of blue, green, and white chairs.\n\nFirst, we know there are 10 blue chairs.\nNext, the number of green chairs is 3 times the number of blue chairs.

The combined total of blue and green chairs is:\n\\[ 10 + 30 = 40 \\]\nSo, the number of white chairs is:\n\\[ 40 - 13 = 27 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of blue, green, and white chairs to find the total number of chairs in the classroom:\n\\[ 10 + 30 + 27 = 67 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of chairs in the classroom is:\n\\[ \\boxed{67} \\]",
