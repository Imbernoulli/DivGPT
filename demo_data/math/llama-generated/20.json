The 3rd competitor ate 25% less than the 2nd competitor. To find 25% of 24, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 24 = 6\n\\]\nSince the 3rd competitor ate 25% less, we subtract this amount from the 2nd competitor's total:\n\\[\n24 - 6 = 18\n\\]\nTherefore, the 3rd competitor ate \\boxed{18} hotdogs.",

Therefore, the 2nd competitor ate:\n\\[\n2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ hot dogs}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hot dogs the 3rd competitor ate. The problem states that the 3rd competitor ate 25% less than the 2nd competitor. To find 25% less, we first calculate 25% of the amount the 2nd competitor ate and then subtract that from the 24 hot dogs.\n\nFirst, calculate 25% of 24:\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 24 = 6 \\text{ hot dogs}\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract this amount from the 24 hot dogs the 2nd competitor ate:\n\\[\n24 - 6 = 18 \\text{ hot dogs}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the 3rd competitor ate \\boxed{18} hot dogs.",
