        "To determine the total number of seashells collected by Stefan, Vail, and Aiguo, we start by finding out how many seashells each child had.\n\nFirst, we know that Aiguo had 20 seashells. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ A = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Vail had 5 less seashells than Aiguo. So, we can calculate the number of seashells Vail had by subtracting 5 from the number of seashells Aiguo had:\n\\[ V = A - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Stefan had 16 more seashells than Vail. So, we can calculate the number of seashells Stefan had by adding 16 to the number of seashells Vail had:\n\\[ S = V + 16 = 15 + 16 = 31 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the number of seashells each child had:\n\\[ S + V + A = 31 + 15 + 20 = 66 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of seashells collected by the three children is:\n\\[ \\boxed{66} \\]",
