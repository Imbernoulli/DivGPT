        "Let \\( E \\) represent the number of dollars Evan earned. According to the problem, Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan. Therefore, Markese earned \\( E - 5 \\) dollars.\n\nThe total amount earned by both Markese and Evan together is given as $37. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:\n\\[\nE + (E - 5) = 37\n\\]\n\nFirst, combine the terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n2E - 5 = 37\n\\]\n\nNext, isolate the term involving \\( E \\) by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n2E - 5 + 5 = 37 + 5\n\\]\n\\[\n2E = 42\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( E \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[\nE = \\frac{42}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nE = 21\n\\]\n\nSo, Evan earned $21. Since Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan, we calculate Markese's earnings as follows:\n\\[\nE - 5 = 21 - 5\n\\]\n\\[\nE - 5 = 16\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Markese earned \\(\\boxed{16}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine how many dollars Markese earned, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.\n\nLet \\( E \\) represent the number of dollars Evan earned. According to the problem, Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan. Therefore, we can express Markese's earnings as:\n\\[ M = E - 5 \\]\n\nWe are also given that together they earned $37. This means the sum of Evan's earnings and Markese's earnings is $37. We can write this as:\n\\[ E + M = 37 \\]\n\nNow, substitute the expression for \\( M \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[ E + (E - 5) = 37 \\]\n\nCombine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 2E - 5 = 37 \\]\n\nNext, isolate the term with \\( E \\) by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2E = 42 \\]\n\nThen, solve for \\( E \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ E = 21 \\]\n\nNow that we know Evan earned $21, we can find out how much Markese earned by substituting \\( E = 21 \\) back into the expression for \\( M \\):\n\\[ M = E - 5 = 21 - 5 = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, Markese earned \\(\\boxed{16}\\) dollars.",
