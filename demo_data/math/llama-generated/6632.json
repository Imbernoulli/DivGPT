        "To determine the cost of 5000 sheets of bond paper, we start by calculating the cost per sheet. Since a ream of 500 sheets costs $27, we can find the cost per sheet by dividing the total cost of the ream by the number of sheets in the ream:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per sheet} = \\frac{27}{500} = 0.054 \\text{ dollars per sheet}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much it will cost to buy 5000 sheets of paper. We do this by multiplying the cost per sheet by the total number of sheets needed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 5000 \\times 0.054 = 270 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost to buy 5000 sheets of bond paper is \\boxed{270}.",
