        "To determine the total number of students in grades 2 and 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of boys and girls in the second grade.\n2. Calculate the number of boys and girls in the third grade.\n3. Add the number of students in the second grade to the number of students in the third grade.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of boys and girls in the second grade:\n- There are 20 boys.\n- There are 11 girls.\n- Therefore, the total number of students in the second grade is \\(20 + 11 = 31\\).\n\nNext, let's find the number of boys and girls in the third grade:\n- There are twice as many boys as in the second grade, so there are \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) boys.\n- There are twice as many girls as in the second grade, so there are \\(2 \\times 11 = 22\\) girls.\n- Therefore, the total number of students in the third grade is \\(40 + 22 = 62\\).\n\nFinally, let's add the number of students in the second grade to the number of students in the third grade:\n- The total number of students in grades 2 and 3 is \\(31 + 62 = 93\\).\n\nThus, the total number of students in grades 2 and 3 is \\(\\boxed{93}\\).",

Add the total number of students in the second grade to the total number of students in the third grade.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of students in the second grade:\n- There are 20 boys.\n- There are 11 girls.\n- Therefore, the total number of students in the second grade is \\(20 + 11 = 31\\).\n\nNext, let's find the total number of students in the third grade:\n- There are twice as many boys as in the second grade, so there are \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) boys.\n- There are twice as many girls as in the second grade, so there are \\(2 \\times 11 = 22\\) girls.\n- Therefore, the total number of students in the third grade is \\(40 + 22 = 62\\).\n\nFinally, let's add the total number of students in the second grade to the total number of students in the third grade:\n- The total number of students in grades 2 and 3 is \\(31 + 62 = 93\\).\n\nThus, the total number of students in grades 2 and 3 is \\(\\boxed{93}\\).",
