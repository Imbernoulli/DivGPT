Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{16} = 4 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 16:\n\\[ x = 4 \\times 16 = 64 \\]\n\nSo, the number of gummy worms Carlos had when he bought the bag is \\(\\boxed{64}\\).",

Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ W_4 = 4 \\]\n\nSince he ate half of the remaining gummy worms on the fourth day, the number of gummy worms he had at the end of the third day must be twice the number he had at the end of the fourth day:\n\\[ W_3 = 2 \\times W_4 = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\n\nSimilarly, the number of gummy worms he had at the end of the second day must be twice the number he had at the end of the third day:\n\\[ W_2 = 2 \\times W_3 = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\n\nAnd the number of gummy worms he had at the end of the first day must be twice the number he had at the end of the second day:\n\\[ W_1 = 2 \\times W_2 = 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\]\n\nFinally, the initial number of gummy worms Carlos bought must be twice the number he had at the end of the first day:\n\\[ W_0 = 2 \\times W_1 = 2 \\times 32 = 64 \\]\n\nThus, the initial number of gummy worms Carlos bought is \\(\\boxed{64}\\).",
        "To determine the original number of gummy worms in the bag, we need to work backwards from the information given about Carlos's consumption over the four days. Let's denote the original number of gummy worms as \\( x \\).\n\n1. **After the fourth day:**\n   - Carlos has 4 gummy worms left.\n   - Before eating on the fourth day, he ate half of the remaining gummy worms, so the number of gummy worms before eating on the fourth day was \\( 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\).\n\n2. **After the third day:**\n   - Carlos had 8 gummy worms left after the third day.\n   - Before eating on the third day, he ate half of the remaining gummy worms, so the number of gummy worms before eating on the third day was \\( 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\).\n\n3. **After the second day:**\n   - Carlos had 16 gummy worms left after the second day.\n   - Before eating on the second day, he ate half of the remaining gummy worms, so the number of gummy worms before eating on the second day was \\( 16 \\times 2 = 32 \\).\n\n4. **After the first day:**\n   - Carlos had 32 gummy worms left after the first day.\n   - Before eating on the first day, he ate half of the remaining gummy worms, so the number of gummy worms before eating on the first day was \\( 32 \\times 2 = 64 \\).\n\nTherefore, the original number of gummy worms in the bag when Carlos bought it was \\(\\boxed{64}\\).",
