        "To determine the total number of students who played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday, we start by identifying the number of students who played each day.\n\nFirst, we know that 37 students played kickball on Wednesday. On Thursday, 9 fewer students played kickball than on Wednesday. Therefore, we can calculate the number of students who played kickball on Thursday by subtracting 9 from 37:\n\n\\[ 37 - 9 = 28 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of students who played kickball on Wednesday to the number of students who played kickball on Thursday to find the total number of students who played kickball over the two days:\n\n\\[ 37 + 28 = 65 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of students who played kickball on Wednesday and Thursday is \\(\\boxed{65}\\).",
