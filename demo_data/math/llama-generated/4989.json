        "To determine how many people play football out of a group of 250, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the proportion of individuals who like football:**\n   - We know that 24 out of every 60 individuals like football.\n   - To find the proportion, we divide the number of individuals who like football by the total number of individuals:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{24}{60}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 12:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{24 \\div 12}{60 \\div 12} = \\frac{2}{5}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, 2 out of every 5 individuals like football.\n\n2. **Determine the number of individuals who like football in a group of 250:**\n   - Since 2 out of every 5 individuals like football, we can set up a proportion to find the number of individuals who like football in a group of 250:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{x}{250}\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( x \\) by cross-multiplying:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 250 = 5 \\times x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     500 = 5x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{500}{5}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 100\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, 100 individuals like football in a group of 250.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of individuals who play football:**\n   - Out of those who like football, 50% play it.\n   - To find the number of individuals who play football, we multiply the number of individuals who like football by 50% (or 0.50):\n     \\[\n     100 \\times 0.50 = 50\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, 50 individuals play football in a group of 250.\n\nThus, the number of people who would you expect play football out of a group of 250 is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",

We do this by multiplying the total number of people by the proportion who like football:\n\\[\n250 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 250 \\times 0.4 = 100\n\\]\nSo, 100 people like football out of the 250.\n\nFinally, we need to determine how many of these 100 people actually play football. We know that 50% of those who like football play it. Therefore, we multiply the number of people who like football by 50%:\n\\[\n100 \\times 0.5 = 50\n\\]\nSo, 50 people play football out of the 250.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]",

We can express this as a fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{60}\n\\]\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12:\n\\[\n\\frac{24 \\div 12}{60 \\div 12} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\nSo, \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the individuals like football.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many people like football out of the group of 250.**\n\nTo find out how many people like football out of 250, we multiply the total number of people by the fraction of those who like football:\n\\[\n250 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 250 \\times 0.4 = 100\n\\]\nSo, 100 people like football out of the group of 250.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many of those who like football actually play it.**\n\nThe problem states that 50% of those who like football play it. So, we need to find 50% of 100:\n\\[\n100 \\times 0.5 = 50\n\\]\nSo, 50 people play football out of the group of 250.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who would be expected to play football out of a group of 250 is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
