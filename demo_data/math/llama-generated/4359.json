He decided to only keep 15 cards and so he gave Miguel some of the cards. Then, he saw 8 friends and decided to give them 12 cards each, and the remaining cards were given equally to his 2 sisters.

        "To determine how many cards Rick gave to Miguel, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cards Rick gave to his 8 friends.\n2. Calculate the total number of cards Rick gave to his 2 sisters.\n3. Subtract the number of cards given to his friends and sisters from the total number of cards Rick originally had after he decided to keep 15 cards.\n4. Determine how many cards Rick gave to Miguel.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\nRick gave each of his 8 friends 12 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards given to his friends is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 12 = 96 \\]\n\nNext, Rick gave each of his 2 sisters 3 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards given to his sisters is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\]\n\nNow, we know that Rick originally had 130 cards and he decided to keep 15 cards. So, the number of cards he had left before giving any to his friends and sisters is:\n\\[ 130 - 15 = 115 \\]\n\nThe total number of cards given to his friends and sisters is:\n\\[ 96 + 6 = 102 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cards Rick gave to Miguel is:\n\\[ 115 - 102 = 13 \\]\n\nSo, the number of cards Rick gave to Miguel is:\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]",

        "To determine how many cards Rick gave to Miguel, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cards Rick gave to his friends:**\n   Rick has 8 friends and he gave each friend 12 cards.\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 12 = 96\n   \\]\n   So, Rick gave 96 cards to his friends.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of cards Rick gave to his sisters:**\n   Rick has 2 sisters and he gave each sister 3 cards.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, Rick gave 6 cards to his sisters.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of cards Rick gave away:**\n   Rick gave away cards to his friends, sisters, and Miguel. We know he kept 15 cards for himself. Let \\( x \\) be the number of cards Rick gave to Miguel. The total number of cards Rick had initially is 130. Therefore, the total number of cards given away is:\n   \\[\n   130 - 15 = 115\n   \\]\n   This is also equal to the sum of the cards given to his friends, sisters, and Miguel:\n   \\[\n   96 + 6 + x = 115\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   102 + x = 115\n   \\]\n   Subtracting 102 from both sides, we find:\n   \\[\n   x = 13\n   \\]\n\nSo, Rick gave Miguel \\(\\boxed{13}\\) cards.",
        "Let's start by determining the total number of cards Rick gave away after he decided to keep 15 cards for himself. Initially, Rick had 130 cards, so after keeping 15 cards, he gave away:\n\n\\[ 130 - 15 = 115 \\text{ cards} \\]\n\nNext, Rick gave 12 cards to each of his 8 friends. The total number of cards given to his friends is:\n\n\\[ 12 \\times 8 = 96 \\text{ cards} \\]\n\nAfter giving cards to his friends, Rick had some cards left, which he gave equally to his 2 sisters. Each sister received 3 cards, so the total number of cards given to his sisters is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ cards} \\]\n\nNow, we can find out how many cards Rick gave to Miguel by subtracting the number of cards given to his friends and sisters from the total number of cards he gave away:\n\n\\[ 115 - 96 - 6 = 13 \\text{ cards} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cards Rick gave to Miguel is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]",
        "To determine how many cards Rick gave to Miguel, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of cards given away step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of cards Rick has:**\n   \\[\n   130\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cards Rick decides to keep:**\n   \\[\n   15\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the number of cards Rick gives away initially is:\n   \\[\n   130 - 15 = 115\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cards given to Rick's 8 friends:**\n   Each friend receives 12 cards, so the total number of cards given to friends is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 12 = 96\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cards given to Rick's 2 sisters:**\n   Each sister receives 3 cards, so the total number of cards given to sisters is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3 = 6\n   \\]\n\n5. **Total cards given to friends and sisters:**\n   Adding the cards given to friends and sisters gives:\n   \\[\n   96 + 6 = 102\n   \\]\n\n6. **Cards given to Miguel:**\n   The remaining cards after giving some to friends and sisters are given to Miguel. Therefore, the number of cards given to Miguel is:\n   \\[\n   115 - 102 = 13\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of cards Rick gave to Miguel is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",
        "To determine how many cards Rick gave to Miguel, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cards Rick gave to his 8 friends.\n2. Calculate the total number of cards Rick gave to his 2 sisters.\n3. Subtract the total number of cards given to his friends and sisters from the number of cards Rick originally had minus the 15 cards he kept.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cards Rick gave to his 8 friends:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ friends} \\times 12 \\text{ cards per friend} = 96 \\text{ cards} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of cards Rick gave to his 2 sisters:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ sisters} \\times 3 \\text{ cards per sister} = 6 \\text{ cards} \\]\n\nNow, let's find out how many cards Rick gave away in total:\n\\[ 96 \\text{ cards} + 6 \\text{ cards} = 102 \\text{ cards} \\]\n\nRick originally had 130 cards and he decided to keep 15 cards, so the number of cards he gave away is:\n\\[ 130 \\text{ cards} - 15 \\text{ cards} = 115 \\text{ cards} \\]\n\nSince we already know he gave away 102 cards to his friends and sisters, the number of cards he gave to Miguel is:\n\\[ 115 \\text{ cards} - 102 \\text{ cards} = 13 \\text{ cards} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cards Rick gave to Miguel is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",
        "To determine how many cards Rick gave to Miguel, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cards Rick gave away:**\n   - Rick kept 15 cards.\n   - Rick gave 8 friends 12 cards each.\n   - Rick gave 2 sisters 3 cards each.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of cards given to Rick's friends:**\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ friends} \\times 12 \\text{ cards per friend} = 96 \\text{ cards}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of cards given to Rick's sisters:**\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ sisters} \\times 3 \\text{ cards per sister} = 6 \\text{ cards}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum the total number of cards given away:**\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ cards kept} + 96 \\text{ cards to friends} + 6 \\text{ cards to sisters} = 117 \\text{ cards}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the number of cards Rick gave to Miguel:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial number of cards} - \\text{Total number of cards given away} = 130 - 117 = 13\n   \\]\n\nThus, Rick gave Miguel \\(\\boxed{13}\\) cards.",
        "To determine how many cards Rick gave to Miguel, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of cards**: Rick starts with 130 cards.\n2. **Cards Rick keeps**: Rick decides to keep 15 cards. Therefore, the number of cards he gives away is:\n   \\[\n   130 - 15 = 115\n   \\]\n3. **Cards given to friends**: Rick sees 8 friends and gives each friend 12 cards.
