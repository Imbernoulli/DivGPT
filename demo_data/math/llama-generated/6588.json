The price of grapes had also increased by half the price that the price of lemon increased by per grape. If he had planned to sell the lemons at $8 and the grapes at $7, and he had 80 lemons and 140 grapes in his basket, how much money did he collect from selling the fruits at the new prices?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
