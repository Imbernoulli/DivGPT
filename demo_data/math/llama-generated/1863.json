        "To determine the cost of a full tank of diesel fuel, we start by finding the cost per liter of diesel fuel. We know that 36 liters of diesel fuel costs €18. Therefore, the cost per liter is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per liter} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost}}{\\text{Total liters}} = \\frac{18}{36} = €0.50 \\text{ per liter}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much it costs to fill a tank that holds 64 liters. Since we know the cost per liter is €0.50, we can calculate the total cost for 64 liters by multiplying the cost per liter by the total number of liters:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost for 64 liters} = 64 \\times 0.50 = €32\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost of a full tank of diesel fuel is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",

To find the cost of a full tank, we multiply the cost per liter by the capacity of the tank:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of a full tank} = \\text{Cost per liter} \\times \\text{Tank capacity} = 0.50 \\text{ euros per liter} \\times 64 \\text{ liters}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of a full tank} = 0.50 \\times 64 = 32 \\text{ euros}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of a full tank of diesel fuel is \\(\\boxed{32}\\) euros.",
