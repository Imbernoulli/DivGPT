        "Let's denote the amount of water Carla drank as \\( w \\) ounces. According to the problem, the amount of soda Carla drank is three times the amount of water minus 6 ounces. Therefore, we can express the amount of soda as \\( 3w - 6 \\) ounces.\n\nThe total amount of liquid Carla drank is the sum of the water and the soda, which is given as 54 ounces. So, we can write the equation:\n\\[\nw + (3w - 6) = 54\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[\nw + 3w - 6 = 54\n\\]\n\\[\n4w - 6 = 54\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( w \\), we first add 6 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n4w - 6 + 6 = 54 + 6\n\\]\n\\[\n4w = 60\n\\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 4:\n\\[\nw = \\frac{60}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nw = 15\n\\]\n\nSo, the amount of water Carla drank is \\(\\boxed{15}\\) ounces.",

So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\nw + (3w - 6) = 54\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[\nw + 3w - 6 = 54\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n4w - 6 = 54\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( w \\), we first add 6 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n4w - 6 + 6 = 54 + 6\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n4w = 60\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{60}{4}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nw = 15\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of water Carla drank is \\(\\boxed{15}\\) ounces.",
