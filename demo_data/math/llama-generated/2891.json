        "To determine how much can be saved per egg if you buy a tray versus individual eggs, we need to calculate the cost per egg for both options and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost per egg when buying individual eggs.

The price of a tray that contains 30 eggs is $12. To find the cost per egg for the tray, we divide the total price of the tray by the number of eggs in the tray:\n\\[ \\frac{12 \\text{ dollars}}{30 \\text{ eggs}} = \\frac{12 \\times 100 \\text{ cents}}{30 \\text{ eggs}} = \\frac{1200 \\text{ cents}}{30 \\text{ eggs}} = 40 \\text{ cents/egg} \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in cost per egg between buying individual eggs and buying a tray:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ cents/egg} - 40 \\text{ cents/egg} = 10 \\text{ cents/egg} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount saved per egg if you buy a tray versus individual eggs is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",

Find the savings per egg by subtracting the cost per egg in the tray from the cost per individual egg.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of buying 30 individual eggs.**\n\nThe price per organic egg is 50 cents.

Since $12 is equivalent to 1200 cents, the cost per egg when buying a tray is:\n\\[ \\frac{1200 \\text{ cents}}{30 \\text{ eggs}} = 40 \\text{ cents/egg} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between the cost per individual egg and the cost per egg when buying a tray.**\n\nThe cost per individual egg is 50 cents, and the cost per egg when buying a tray is 40 cents. The savings per egg is:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ cents} - 40 \\text{ cents} = 10 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount you can save per egg if you buy a tray versus individual eggs is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

Therefore, the total cost for 30 eggs is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 50 = 1500 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost per egg when buying a tray.**\n\nThe price of a tray of 30 eggs is $12. Since $12 is equivalent to 1200 cents, the cost per egg when buying a tray is:\n\\[ \\frac{1200}{30} = 40 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference in cost per egg between buying individually and buying a tray.**\n\nThe difference in cost per egg is:\n\\[ 50 - 40 = 10 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount saved per egg if you buy a tray versus individual eggs is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
