        "To determine how much money James has left after his purchases, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.

Determine how much money James spends on the video game.\n   He spends half of his savings on the video game, so:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   After buying the video game, he has:\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3.

        "First, we calculate how much money James earns in four weeks. Since he earns $10 per week, we multiply $10 by 4:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\]\n\nSo, James has $40 after saving all his money for four weeks. Next, he spends half of this money on a new video game. We calculate half of $40:\n\n\\[ \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\]\n\nAfter buying the video game, James has $40 - $20 = $20 left. Then, he spends a quarter of what is left to buy a new book. We calculate a quarter of $20:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20}{4} = 5 \\]\n\nAfter buying the book, James has $20 - $5 = $15 left. Therefore, the amount of money James has left is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]",

Over four weeks, he saves:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ dollars/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. James spends half of his savings on a new video game. Therefore, he spends:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40 \\text{ dollars}}{2} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   After buying the video game, he has:\n   \\[\n   40 \\text{ dollars} - 20 \\text{ dollars} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. James then spends a quarter of what is left to buy a new book. Therefore, he spends:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20 \\text{ dollars}}{4} = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   After buying the book, he has:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ dollars} - 5 \\text{ dollars} = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money James has left is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
