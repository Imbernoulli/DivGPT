        "To determine the total number of trees Salaria has, we start by defining variables for the number of each type of tree. Let \\( x \\) be the number of tree A and \\( y \\) be the number of tree B. According to the problem, Salaria has 50% of tree A and 50% of tree B, which means:\n\n\\[ x = y \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of good oranges produced by each type of tree per month. Tree A gives 10 oranges per month, and 60% of these oranges are good. Therefore, the number of good oranges from tree A per month is:\n\n\\[ 0.6 \\times 10x = 6x \\]\n\nTree B gives 15 oranges per month, and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of these oranges are good. Therefore, the number of good oranges from tree B per month is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 15y = 5y \\]\n\nThe total number of good oranges produced per month by both types of trees is given as 55. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 6x + 5y = 55 \\]\n\nSince \\( x = y \\), we substitute \\( y \\) with \\( x \\) in the equation:\n\n\\[ 6x + 5x = 55 \\]\n\\[ 11x = 55 \\]\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nSince \\( x = y \\), we also have \\( y = 5 \\). The total number of trees is the sum of the number of tree A and tree B:\n\n\\[ x + y = 5 + 5 = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of trees Salaria has is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",

Therefore, each tree B gives \\( 15 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 5 \\) good oranges per month. So, the total number of good oranges from all the tree B's is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\times 5 = \\frac{5x}{2} \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of good oranges Salaria gets per month is 55. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 3x + \\frac{5x}{2} = 55 \\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:\n\\[ 6x + 5x = 110 \\]\n\\[ 11x = 110 \\]\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of trees Salaria has is \\( \\boxed{10} \\)."
