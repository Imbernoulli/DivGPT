We know from the problem statement that two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock, and we are also given that two white socks cost 45 cents.\n\nLet's denote the cost of one brown sock as \\( b \\) cents. According to the problem, the cost of two white socks is 25 cents more than the cost of one brown sock. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\\[ 45 = b + 25 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( b \\), we need to isolate \\( b \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 25 from both sides:\n\\[ 45 - 25 = b \\]\n\\[ 20 = b \\]\n\nSo, the cost of one brown sock is 20 cents. To find the cost of 15 brown socks, we multiply the cost of one brown sock by 15:\n\\[ 15 \\times 20 = 300 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of 15 brown socks is \\(\\boxed{300}\\) cents.",

We know from the problem statement that two white socks cost 45 cents and that two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock. Let's denote the cost of one brown sock by \\( b \\) cents. According to the problem, we can write the following equation:\n\n\\[ 2w = b + 25 \\]\n\nwhere \\( w \\) is the cost of one white sock. Since we know that two white socks cost 45 cents, we can substitute 45 for \\( 2w \\) in the equation:\n\n\\[ 45 = b + 25 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( b \\) by subtracting 25 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ b = 45 - 25 \\]\n\\[ b = 20 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of one brown sock is 20 cents. To find the cost of 15 brown socks, we multiply the cost of one brown sock by 15:\n\n\\[ 15b = 15 \\times 20 \\]\n\\[ 15b = 300 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of 15 brown socks is \\(\\boxed{300}\\) cents.",
