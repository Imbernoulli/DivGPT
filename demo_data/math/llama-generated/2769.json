We need to find out how many cookies were thrown on the floor, given that they had 93 edible cookies at the end.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cookies baked after the additional cookies were made:\n- Alice baked an initial 74 cookies and then 5 more, so she baked a total of \\(74 + 5 = 79\\) cookies.\n- Bob baked an initial 7 cookies and then 36 more, so he baked a total of \\(7 + 36 = 43\\) cookies.\n\nAdding these together gives the total number of cookies baked:\n\\[79 + 43 = 122\\]\n\nSince they had 93 edible cookies at the end, the number of cookies that were accidentally thrown on the floor is the difference between the total number of cookies baked and the number of edible cookies:\n\\[122 - 93 = 29\\]\n\nThus, the number of cookies accidentally thrown on the floor is \\(\\boxed{29}\\).",
