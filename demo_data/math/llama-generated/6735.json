        "To determine the number of clear pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up, we start by defining the total number of pieces of glass as \\( T \\). According to the problem, the number of green pieces is 35 and they make up 25% of the total glass. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 35 = 0.25T \\]\n\nTo find \\( T \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{35}{0.25} = 140 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up is 140. We know the number of amber pieces is 20 and the number of green pieces is 35. Let the number of clear pieces be \\( C \\). Then, we can write the equation for the total number of pieces of glass as:\n\n\\[ 20 + 35 + C = 140 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\n\\[ 55 + C = 140 \\]\n\nTo find \\( C \\), we subtract 55 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ C = 140 - 55 = 85 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of clear pieces of glass is \\(\\boxed{85}\\).",

        "To determine the number of clear pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up, we start by defining the total number of pieces of glass as \\( T \\). According to the problem, the green pieces represent 25% of the total glass. Since Jerry sweeps up 35 green pieces, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 0.25T = 35 \\]\n\nTo find \\( T \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{35}{0.25} = 140 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of pieces of glass Jerry sweeps up is 140. Next, we need to find out how many clear pieces there are. We know the total number of pieces is the sum of the amber pieces, the green pieces, and the clear pieces. Let's denote the number of clear pieces as \\( C \\).
