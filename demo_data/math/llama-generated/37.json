        "To find the average number of different birds Kendra saw on each site, we need to calculate the total number of birds she saw over the three days and then divide by the total number of sites she visited.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of birds Kendra saw on each day:\n- On Monday, Kendra visited 5 sites and saw an average of 7 birds at each site. So, the total number of birds on Monday is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 7 = 35\n  \\]\n- On Tuesday, Kendra visited 5 sites and saw an average of 5 birds at each site. So, the total number of birds on Tuesday is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 5 = 25\n  \\]\n- On Wednesday, Kendra visited 10 sites and saw an average of 8 birds at each site. So, the total number of birds on Wednesday is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 8 = 80\n  \\]\n\nNext, we add up the total number of birds seen over the three days:\n\\[\n35 + 25 + 80 = 140\n\\]\n\nNow, we add up the total number of sites visited over the three days:\n\\[\n5 + 5 + 10 = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the average number of different birds Kendra saw on each site, we divide the total number of birds by the total number of sites:\n\\[\n\\frac{140}{20} = 7\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of different birds Kendra saw on each site is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
