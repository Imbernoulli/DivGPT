        "To determine how many vacant seats from the students can be given to the parents, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of chairs in the setup.\n2. Determine the number of chairs reserved for each group.\n3. Calculate the number of occupied seats for the students.\n4. Determine the number of vacant seats for the students.\n5. finds out how many of these vacant seats can be given to the parents.\n\nLet's start with the total number of chairs:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ rows} \\times 15 \\text{ chairs per row} = 150 \\text{ chairs}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of chairs reserved for each group:\n- The first row is reserved for the awardees: \\(15\\) chairs.\n- The second and third rows are for the administrators and teachers: \\(2 \\times 15 = 30\\) chairs.\n- The last two rows are reserved for the parents: \\(2 \\times 15 = 30\\) chairs.\n- The rest of the rows are for the students: \\(10 - 1 - 2 - 2 = 5\\) rows. Therefore, the number of chairs for the students is \\(5 \\times 15 = 75\\) chairs.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of occupied seats for the students:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5} \\text{ of } 75 = \\frac{4 \\times 75}{5} = 60 \\text{ seats}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of vacant seats for the students:\n\\[\n75 - 60 = 15 \\text{ seats}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find out how many of these vacant seats can be given to the parents. Since the parents have 30 chairs reserved and 15 seats are vacant, the number of vacant seats that can be given to the parents is:\n\\[\n\\min(15, 30) = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of vacant seats from the students that can be given to the parents is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
