        "To determine how many points James beat the old record by, we need to calculate the total points he scored during the season and then compare that to the old record.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the points from the touchdowns. James scores 4 touchdowns per game, and each touchdown is worth 6 points. There are 15 games in the season. Therefore, the total points from touchdowns is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ touchdowns/game} \\times 6 \\text{ points_CONSOLE} \\times 15 \\text{ games} = 360 \\text{ points} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the points from the 2-point conversions. James scores 2-point conversions 6 times during the season. Therefore, the total points from 2-point conversions is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ points_ser} \\times 6 = 12 \\text{ points} \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total points James scored during the season by adding the points from touchdowns and the points from 2-point conversions:\n\\[ 360 \\text{ points} + 12 \\text{ points} = 372 \\text{ points} \\]\n\nThe old record was 300 points. To find out how many points James beat the old record by, we subtract the old record from the total points James scored:\n\\[ 372 \\text{ points} - 300 \\text{ points} = 72 \\text{ points} \\]\n\nTherefore, James beat the old record by \\(\\boxed{72}\\) points.",
