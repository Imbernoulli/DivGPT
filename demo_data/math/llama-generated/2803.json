        "To determine the total number of feet John climbed, we need to calculate the number of steps in each staircase and then convert those steps into feet.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of steps in each staircase:\n- The first staircase has 20 steps.\n- The second staircase has twice as many steps as the first staircase. Therefore, the second staircase has:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ steps}\n  \\]\n- The third staircase has 10 fewer steps than the second staircase. Therefore, the third staircase has:\n  \\[\n  40 - 10 = 30 \\text{ steps}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we sum the total number of steps from all three staircases:\n\\[\n20 + 40 + 30 = 90 \\text{ steps}\n\\]\n\nEach step is 0.5 feet.

Since the second staircase has 40 steps, we subtract 10 from 40:\n\\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \\]\nSo, the third staircase has 30 steps.\n\n**Step 3: Find the total number of steps in all three staircases.**\nWe add the number of steps in the first, second, and third staircases:\n\\[ 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 \\]\nSo, the total number of steps is 90.\n\n**Step 4: Convert the total number of steps into feet.**\nEach step is 0.5 feet.
