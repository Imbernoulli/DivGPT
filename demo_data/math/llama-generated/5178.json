A 40% increase means we need to find 40% of $340 and add it to the decreased price.\n\n\\[ 40\\% \\text{ of } 340 = 0.40 \\times 340 = 136 \\]\n\nSo, the price after the increase is:\n\n\\[ 340 + 136 = 476 \\]\n\nTherefore, the final price of the book is \\(\\boxed{476}\\).",

Calculate the price of the book after a 40% increase on the decreased price.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the price after a 15% decrease.**\n\nThe original price of the book is $400. A 15% decrease in price means we need to find 15% of $400 and subtract it from the original price.\n\n\\[ 15\\% \\text{ of } 400 = 0.15 \\times 400 = 60 \\]\n\nSo, the price after the decrease is:\n\n\\[ 400 - 60 = 340 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the price after a 40% increase.**\n\nNow, the price of the book is $340. A 40% increase in price means we need to find 40% of $340 and add it to the decreased price.\n\n\\[ 40\\% \\text{ of } 340 = 0.40 \\times 340 = 136 \\]\n\nSo, the price after the increase is:\n\n\\[ 340 + 136 = 476 \\]\n\nTherefore, the final price of the book is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{476} \\]",
