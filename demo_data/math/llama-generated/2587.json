Subtract the total number of green, red, and blue flowers from the total number of flowers to find the number of yellow flowers.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- The total number of flowers is 96.\n- The number of green flowers is 9.\n- The number of red flowers is three times the number of green flowers.\n- The number of blue flowers is 50% of the total flower count.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of red flowers:\n\\[ \\text{Number of red flowers} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of green flowers} = 3 \\times 9 = 27 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the number of blue flowers:\n\\[ \\text{Number of blue flowers} = 50\\% \\times \\text{Total number of flowers} = 0.5 \\times 96 = 48 \\]\n\nNow, add the number of green, red, and blue flowers to find out how many flowers these three colors account for:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of green, red, and blue flowers} = 9 + 27 + 48 = 84 \\]\n\nFinally, subtract the total number of green, red, and blue flowers from the total number of flowers to find the number of yellow flowers:\n\\[ \\text{Number of yellow flowers} = \\text{Total number of flowers} - \\text{Total number of green, red, and blue flowers} = 96 - 84 = 12 \\]\n\nThus, the number of yellow flowers is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
