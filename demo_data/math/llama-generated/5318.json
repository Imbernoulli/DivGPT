        "To determine the total number of rubber bands Harper and his brother have together, we start by finding out how many rubber bands Harper's brother has. Harper has 15 rubber bands, and his brother has 6 fewer rubber bands than Harper. Therefore, we can calculate the number of rubber bands his brother has as follows:\n\n\\[ 15 - 6 = 9 \\]\n\nSo, Harper's brother has 9 rubber bands. Next, we need to find the total number of rubber bands that Harper and his brother have together by adding the number of rubber bands each of them has:\n\n\\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of rubber bands they have together is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
