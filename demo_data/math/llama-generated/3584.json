The area of this wall is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the third wall} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 20 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 12 \\, \\text{feet} = 240 \\, \\text{square feet}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the areas of all three walls to find the total square footage of glass needed:\n\\[\n\\text{Total square footage of glass} = 720 \\, \\text{square feet} + 240 \\, \\text{square feet} = 960 \\, \\text{square feet}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total square footage of glass James needs is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{960}\n\\]",
