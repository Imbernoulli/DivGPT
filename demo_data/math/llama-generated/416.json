        "To determine the total number of miles Peter and Andrew have run after 5 days, we need to calculate the distance each of them runs in one day and then multiply by 5.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many miles Peter runs in one day. According to the problem, Peter runs 3 miles more than Andrew. Since Andrew runs 2 miles each day, we can calculate Peter's daily running distance as follows:\n\\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total distance each of them runs over 5 days. For Andrew, since he runs 2 miles each day, over 5 days he runs:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nFor Peter, since he runs 5 miles each day, over 5 days he runs:\n\\[ 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTo find the total distance both Peter and Andrew have run together, we add their individual distances:\n\\[ 10 + 25 = 35 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of miles Peter and Andrew have run after 5 days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]",
