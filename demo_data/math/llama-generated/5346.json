She then visited the camels and learned that there were only half as many camels as there were zebras. Next, she visited the monkeys and counted 4 times the number of monkeys as camels. Finally, she saw some giraffes and counted only 2 giraffes. How many more monkeys than giraffes did Carla see?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
