This means she drove the cab for:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{150 \\text{ km}}{3} = 50 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total distance traveled:**\n   To find the total distance, we add the distances traveled by train, bus, and cab:\n   \\[\n   300 \\text{ km} + 150 \\text{ km} + 50 \\text{ km} = 500 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total distance Kristine traveled to reach her destination is \\(\\boxed{500}\\) kilometers.",
