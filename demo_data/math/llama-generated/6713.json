Therefore, the total revenue he needs to generate from selling all the pies is:\n\n\\[90 + 20 = 110 \\text{ dollars}\\]\n\nBenny is making a total of \\(10 + 12 = 22\\) pies. If he sells each pie for the same price, let's denote the price of each pie by \\(x\\). The total revenue from selling all the pies is then:\n\n\\[22x = 110\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 22:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{110}{22} = 5\\]\n\nTherefore, Benny has to charge \\(\\boxed{5}\\) dollars for each pie."
