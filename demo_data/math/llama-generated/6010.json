        "To determine how many times John uses the bathroom during a 2.5-hour movie, we first need to convert the movie length from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total movie length in minutes as follows:\n\n\\[\n2.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many 50-minute intervals fit into 150 minutes. We do this by dividing the total movie length by the time interval between bathroom visits:\n\n\\[\n150 \\text{ minutes} \\div 50 \\text{ minutes/visit} = 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, John uses the bathroom 3 times during the 2.5-hour movie.
