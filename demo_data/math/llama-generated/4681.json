        "To determine 60% of the total number of boys and girls at the event, we first need to find the number of girls. According to the problem, the difference between the number of boys and girls is 400, and the number of girls is more than the number of boys. We are given that there are 600 boys.\n\nLet's denote the number of girls by \\( G \\). The difference between the number of girls and boys is given by:\n\\[ G - 600 = 400 \\]\n\nTo find \\( G \\), we add 600 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ G = 400 + 600 \\]\n\\[ G = 1000 \\]\n\nNow that we know there are 1000 girls, we can find the total number of boys and girls by adding the number of boys and the number of girls:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of boys and girls} = 600 + 1000 = 1600 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find 60% of the total number of boys and girls. To do this, we multiply the total number by 60% (or 0.60):\n\\[ 60\\% \\text{ of } 1600 = 0.60 \\times 1600 = 960 \\]\n\nTherefore, 60% of the total number of boys and girls at the event is:\n\\[ \\boxed{960} \\]",

We do this by multiplying the total number by 60% (or 0.60):\n\\[\n60\\% \\text{ of the total number} = 0.60 \\times 1600 = 960\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 60% of the total number of boys and girls at the event is \\boxed{960}.",
