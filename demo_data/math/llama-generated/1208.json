        "To determine how many pills Jeremy takes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of Tylenol Jeremy takes in one day.\n2. Calculate the total amount of Tylenol Jeremy takes in two weeks.\n3. Determine the number of pills based on the total amount of Tylenol.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of Tylenol Jeremy takes in one day. Jeremy takes 1000 mg every 6 hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can find out how many 6-hour intervals are in a day by dividing 24 by 6:\n\\[ \\frac{24}{6} = 4 \\]\nSo, Jeremy takes 1000 mg four times a day. Therefore, the total amount of Tylenol he takes in one day is:\n\\[ 1000 \\, \\text{mg} \\times 4 = 4000 \\, \\text{mg} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of Tylenol Jeremy takes in two weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are \\( 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\) days in two weeks. Therefore, the total amount of Tylenol he takes in two weeks is:\n\\[ 4000 \\, \\text{mg/day} \\times 14 \\, \\text{days} = 56000 \\, \\text{mg} \\]\n\nFinally, we need to determine the number of pills Jeremy takes. Since each pill is 500 mg, the total number of pills is:\n\\[ \\frac{56000 \\, \\text{mg}}{500 \\, \\text{mg/pill}} = 112 \\, \\text{pills} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of pills Jeremy takes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{112} \\]",
