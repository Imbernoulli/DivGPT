        "To determine the total amount of money Mallory used for her journey, we need to calculate the cost of fuel and the cost of food separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of fuel. The car can travel 500 miles on one full tank of fuel, and Mallory is traveling 2000 miles. Therefore, the number of full tanks of fuel she will need is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2000 \\text{ miles}}{500 \\text{ miles/tank}} = 4 \\text{ tanks}\n\\]\nSince each tank costs $45, the total cost of fuel is:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ tanks} \\times 45 \\text{ dollars/tank} = 180 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of food. Mallory spent \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) times as much money on food as she spent on fuel. Therefore, the cost of food is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 180 \\text{ dollars} = \\frac{3 \\times 180}{5} = \\frac{540}{5} = 108 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the cost of fuel and the cost of food to find the total amount of money Mallory used:\n\\[\n180 \\text{ dollars} + 108 \\text{ dollars} = 288 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Mallory used is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{288}\n\\]",

        "To determine the total amount of money Mallory used, we need to calculate the cost of fuel for the journey and the cost of food separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of fuel for the journey. Mallory is traveling 2000 miles, and each full tank of fuel allows her to travel 500 miles. Therefore, the number of full tanks of fuel she needs is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2000 \\text{ miles}}{500 \\text{ miles per tank}} = 4 \\text{ tanks}\n\\]\nSince each tank costs $45, the total cost of fuel is:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ tanks} \\times 45 \\text{ dollars per tank} = 180 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of food. Mallory spent \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) times as much money on food as she spent on filling the car fuel tank for the whole journey. Therefore, the cost of food is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 180 \\text{ dollars} = 108 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the cost of fuel and the cost of food to find the total amount of money Mallory used:\n\\[\n180 \\text{ dollars} + 108 \\text{ dollars} = 288 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Mallory used is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{288}\n\\]",
