Therefore, the length of the mid-size model is:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of mid-size model} = 240 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = 24 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the length of the smallest model.**\n\nThe smallest model is half the size of the mid-size model. Since the mid-size model is 24 inches long, the length of the smallest model is:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of smallest model} = 24 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 12 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of the smallest model mustang is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) inches.",
