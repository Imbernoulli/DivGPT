Determine the total number of followers Denny loses in a year:\n   Denny loses 20000 followers in a year.\n\n3. Calculate the net change in followers over the year:\n   The net change in followers is the total number of new followers gained minus the total number of followers lost.\n   \\[\n   365000 \\text{ followers} - 20000 \\text{ followers} = 345000 \\text{ followers}\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the total number of followers Denny will have after a year:\n   Add the net change in followers to Denny's initial number of followers.\n   \\[\n   100000 \\text{ followers} + 345000 \\text{ followers} = 445000 \\text{ followers}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of followers Denny will have after a year is \\(\\boxed{445000}\\).",
        "To determine how many followers Denny will have after a year, we need to consider both the new followers he gains each day and the number of followers who unfollow him in the year.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of new followers Denny gains in a year. Since he gets 1000 new followers every day, and there are 365 days in a year, we multiply:\n\n\\[\n1000 \\text{ followers/day} \\times 365 \\text{ days/year} = 365000 \\text{ followers/year}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that 20000 followers unfollow Denny in a year. So, we subtract the number of unfollows from the total number of new followers and add the result to his initial number of followers. Denny starts with 100000 followers, so we calculate:\n\n\\[\n100000 \\text{ initial followers} + 365000 \\text{ new followers} - 20000 \\text{ unfollows} = 445000 \\text{ followers}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of followers Denny will have after a year is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{445000}\n\\]"
