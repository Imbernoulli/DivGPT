She asked if she could take some home to care for, and she was allowed to catch half of them. While using a catching net, she caught 3/5 of the total number of goldfish she was allowed to take home. How many goldfish does Maggie remain with to catch to get the total number she was allowed to take home?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many goldfish Maggie remain with to catch, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of goldfish Maggie is allowed to take home.\n2. Determine how many goldfish Maggie has already caught.\n3. Subtract the number of goldfish Maggie has already caught from the total number she is allowed to take home.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of goldfish Maggie is allowed to take home. Since she is allowed to take half of the 100 goldfish, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{100}{2} = 50\n\\]\nSo, Maggie is allowed to take home 50 goldfish.\n\nNext, we determine how many goldfish Maggie has already caught. She caught \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the total number of goldfish she was allowed to take home. Therefore, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 50 = 30\n\\]\nSo, Maggie has already caught 30 goldfish.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of goldfish Maggie has already caught from the total number she is allowed to take home to find out how many more goldfish she needs to catch:\n\\[\n50 - 30 = 20\n\\]\nSo, Maggie remains with \\(\\boxed{20}\\) goldfish to catch to get the total number she was allowed to take home.",

Determine how many goldfish Maggie has already caught.\n3. Subtract the number of goldfish Maggie has already caught from the total number she is allowed to take home.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of goldfish Maggie is allowed to take home. Since she is allowed to take half of the 100 goldfish, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{100}{2} = 50\n\\]\nSo, Maggie is allowed to take home 50 goldfish.\n\nNext, we determine how many goldfish Maggie has already caught. She caught \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the total number of goldfish she was allowed to take home. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 50 = 30\n\\]\nSo, Maggie has already caught 30 goldfish.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of goldfish Maggie has already caught from the total number she is allowed to take home to find out how many more goldfish she needs to catch:\n\\[\n50 - 30 = 20\n\\]\nSo, Maggie remains with \\(\\boxed{20}\\) goldfish to catch to get the total number she was allowed to take home.",
