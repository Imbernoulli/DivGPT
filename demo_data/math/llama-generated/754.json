        "To determine how many hours of battery Brody's calculator will have left after taking the two-hour math exam, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of battery Brody has used.\n2. Subtract the amount of battery used from the total battery capacity to find out how much battery is left before the exam.\n3. Subtract the duration of the exam from the remaining battery to find out how much battery is left after the exam.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Brody has used three quarters of the battery. Since the calculator can run for 60 hours on a full battery, we calculate the amount of battery used as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Battery used} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 60 = 45 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount of battery used from the total battery capacity to find out how much battery is left before the exam:\n\\[\n\\text{Battery left before exam} = 60 - 45 = 15 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the duration of the exam from the remaining battery to find out how much battery is left after the exam:\n\\[\n\\text{Battery left after exam} = 15 - 2 = 13 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hours of battery Brody's calculator will have left is \\boxed{13}.",
        "To determine how many hours of battery Brody's calculator will have left after taking the two-hour math exam, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total battery usage so far:**\n   Brody has used three quarters of the battery. Since the calculator can run for 60 hours on a full battery, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Battery usage} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 60 = 45 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the battery usage for the exam:**\n   Brody is about to take a two-hour math exam, which will use the calculator for the entire time. Therefore, we add 2 hours to the battery usage:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total battery usage} = 45 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 47 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the remaining battery life:**\n   To find out how many hours of battery will be left, we subtract the total battery usage from the initial battery capacity:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining battery life} = 60 \\text{ hours} - 47 \\text{ hours} = 13 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, after taking the two-hour math exam, Brody's calculator will have \\boxed{13} hours of battery left.",

Calculate the amount of battery life Brody has used.\n2. Subtract the battery life used from the total battery life to find out how much battery life remains before the exam.\n3. Subtract the battery life used during the exam from the remaining battery life.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of battery life Brody has used. The calculator can run for 60 hours on a full battery, and Brody has used three quarters of it. Therefore, we multiply 60 by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\):\n\\[\n60 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 60 \\times 0.75 = 45 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the battery life used from the total battery life to find out how much battery life remains before the exam:\n\\[\n60 - 45 = 15 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThen, we subtract the battery life used during the exam from the remaining battery life. The exam will take 2 hours, so we subtract 2 from 15:\n\\[\n15 - 2 = 13 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hours of battery Brody's calculator will have left is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",

Subtract the battery life used during the exam from the remaining battery life.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of battery life Brody has used. Since he has used three quarters of the battery, we can find this by multiplying the total battery life by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\):\n\\[\n60 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 60 \\times 0.75 = 45 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nSo, Brody has used 45 hours of battery life.\n\nNext, we subtract the battery life used from the total battery life to find out how much battery life is left before the exam:\n\\[\n60 - 45 = 15 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nSo, there are 15 hours of battery life left before the exam.\n\nNow, we subtract the battery life used during the exam from the remaining battery life. Since the exam lasts 2 hours, we subtract 2 hours from the 15 hours left:\n\\[\n15 - 2 = 13 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nSo, after the exam, Brody's calculator will have \\(\\boxed{13}\\) hours of battery life left.",
