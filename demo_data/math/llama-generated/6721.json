Let's define the following sets:\n\n- Let \\( F \\) be the set of students who like French fries.\n- Let \\( B \\) be the set of students who like burgers.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- The total number of students in the class is \\( |U| = 25 \\).\n- The number of students who like French fries is \\( |F| = 15 \\).\n- The number of students who like burgers is \\( |B| = 10 \\).\n- The number of students who like both French fries and burgers is \\( |F \\cap B| = 6 \\).\n\nWe need to find the number of students who like either French fries or burgers or both. This is given by the formula for the union of two sets:\n\n\\[\n|F \\cup B| = |F| + |B| - |F \\cap B|\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n|F \\cup B| = 15 + 10 - 6 = 19\n\\]\n\nSo, 19 students like either French fries or burgers or both. To find the number of students who do not like either food, we subtract the number of students who like either food from the total number of students:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students who do not like either food} = |U| - |F \\cup B| = 25 - 19 = 6\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students who do not like either food is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
