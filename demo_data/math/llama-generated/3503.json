        "To determine how much it will cost Monty to buy enough chicken and sides to feed 36 family members, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of servings needed:**\n   Monty has 36 family members, and each person needs one serving. Therefore, the total number of servings required is:\n   \\[\n   36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of buckets required:**\n   Each bucket feeds 6 people. To find out how many buckets are needed to feed 36 people, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per bucket:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{6} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, Monty needs 6 buckets.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   Each bucket costs $12.00. To find the total cost for 6 buckets, we multiply the number of buckets by the cost per bucket:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 12 = 72\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost for Monty to buy enough chicken and sides to feed 36 family members is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{72}\n\\]",
