        "To determine how much money the employee made in the workweek, we need to calculate the total number of hours he worked and then apply the pay rates accordingly.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of hours worked each day:\n- For the first 3 days, the employee works 6 hours each day. Therefore, the total hours for these 3 days is:\n  \\[\n  6 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 18 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n- For the remaining 2 days, the employee works twice as many hours per day as he did for the first 3 days. So, he works:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 6 \\text{ hours/day} = 12 \\text{ hours/day}\n  \\]\n  Therefore, the total hours for these 2 days is:\n  \\[\n  12 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 24 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n\nNext, add the hours worked over the 5 days to get the total hours for the week:\n\\[\n18 \\text{ hours} + 24 \\text{ hours} = 42 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThe employee earns $30 per hour for the first 40 hours. So, the pay for the first 40 hours is:\n\\[\n40 \\text{ hours} \\times 30 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 1200 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFor the remaining 2 hours (since he worked 42 hours in total), he earns an additional 50% over the regular hourly wage. The hourly wage for these additional hours is:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 1.5 = 45 \\text{ dollars/hour}\n\\]\nSo, the pay for the additional 2 hours is:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ hours} \\times 45 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, add the pay for the first 40 hours and the pay for the additional 2 hours to get the total pay for the week:\n\\[\n1200 \\text{ dollars} + 90 \\text{ dollars} = 1290 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the employee made is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1290}\n\\]",

Sum the earnings from both parts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of hours worked in the week. The employee works 6 hours each day for the first 3 days and twice as many hours per day for the remaining 2 days.

The employee earns $30 per hour for the first 40 hours, so the earnings for the first 40 hours are:\n\\[\n40 \\times 30 = 1200 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the earnings for the hours worked above 40 hours. The employee earns an additional 50% for each hour above 40 hours, which means he earns $30 \\times 1.5 = $45 per hour for the hours worked above 40 hours. Therefore, the earnings for the 2 hours worked above 40 hours are:\n\\[\n2 \\times 45 = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the earnings from both parts to find the total earnings for the week:\n\\[\n1200 + 90 = 1290 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money the employee made is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1290}\n\\]",

Calculate the earnings for the regular hours.\n6. Calculate the earnings for the overtime hours.\n7. Add the earnings from the regular hours and the overtime hours to get the total earnings.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n1. The employee works 6 hours per day for the first 3 days.\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 18 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. The employee works twice as many hours per day for the remaining 2 days. Since he works 6 hours per day for the first 3 days, he works \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\) hours per day for the remaining 2 days.\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 24 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3.

Determine the regular hours and the overtime hours. The regular hours are the first 40 hours, and the overtime hours are the hours worked above 40.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Regular hours} = 40 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Overtime hours} = 42 \\text{ hours} - 40 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. Calculate the earnings for the regular hours. The employee makes $30 per hour for the regular hours.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings for regular hours} = 40 \\text{ hours} \\times 30 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 1200 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. Calculate the earnings for the overtime hours. The employee makes an additional 50% for every hour above 40, which means he makes \\(30 \\times 1.5 = 45\\) dollars per hour for the overtime hours.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings for overtime hours} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\times 45 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n7.

Add the pay from steps 3 and 4 to get the total pay.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of hours worked in the week. The employee works 6 hours each day for the first 3 days, and twice as many hours per day for the remaining 2 days. So, for the first 3 days, the employee works:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 18 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFor the remaining 2 days, the employee works:\n\\[ 2 \\times 6 \\text{ hours/day} = 12 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 24 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nAdding these together gives the total number of hours worked in the week:\n\\[ 18 \\text{ hours} + 24 \\text{ hours} = 42 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of hours worked above the standard 40-hour week:\n\\[ 42 \\text{ hours} - 40 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the pay for the standard 40 hours. The employee makes $30 per hour for the first 40 hours:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ hours} \\times 30 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 1200 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe employee makes an additional 50% for every hour above 40 hours. So, for the 2 hours above 40 hours, the pay is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours} \\times 30 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 1.5 = 2 \\text{ hours} \\times 45 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the pay for the standard 40 hours and the pay for the hours worked above 40 gives the total pay:\n\\[ 1200 \\text{ dollars} + 90 \\text{ dollars} = 1290 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the employee made is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1290} \\]",
