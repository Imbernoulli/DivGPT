Since we took 100 photographs 18 hours ago, we can find 20% of 100 and subtract it from 100:\n\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \\times 100 = 20 \\]\n\\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \\]\n\nSo, we will take 80 photographs today.\n\nNext, we find the total number of photographs taken so far by adding the photographs taken 18 hours ago to the photographs taken today:\n\n\\[ 100 + 80 = 180 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of photographs taken so far from 300 to find out how many more photographs are needed:\n\n\\[ 300 - 180 = 120 \\]\n\nTherefore, we need to take \\(\\boxed{120}\\) more photographs to reach the target of 300 photographs.",
