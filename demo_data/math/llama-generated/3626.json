        "To determine the total number of sheets of paper Miss Adamson will use for all of her students, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students Miss Adamson has.\n2. Determine the total number of sheets of paper used for all the students.\n\nFirst, we find the total number of students. Miss Adamson has four classes with 20 students each. Therefore, we multiply the number of classes by the number of students per class:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ classes} \\times 20 \\text{ students per class} = 80 \\text{ students} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of sheets of paper used. Since each student uses 5 sheets of paper, we multiply the total number of students by the number of sheets of paper per student:\n\\[ 80 \\text{ students} \\times 5 \\text{ sheets per student} = 400 \\text{ sheets} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of sheets of paper Miss Adamson will use for all of her students is \\(\\boxed{400}\\).",
