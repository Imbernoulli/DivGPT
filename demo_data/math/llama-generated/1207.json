        "To find the total bill including the tip, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the ICONs ordered.\n2. Add the cost of the appetizer.\n3. Calculate the cost of the desserts.\n4. Sum up all the costs.\n5. Calculate the tip.\n6. Add the tip to the total cost.\n\nLet's start with the cost of the Icons ordered:\n- The mom ordered lobster for $25.50.\n- The dad ordered steak for $35.00.\n- The twin boys both ordered a cheeseburger and fries for $13.50 each.\n\nSo, the total cost of the Icones is:\n\\[ 25.50 + 35.00 + 13.50 + 13.50 = 87.50 \\]\n\nNext, add the cost of the appetizer:\n\\[ 87.50 + 8.50 = 96.00 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the cost of the desserts. Since everyone ordered a dessert and there are 4 people, the total cost of the desserts is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 6.00 = 24.00 \\]\n\nAdd the cost of the desserts to the total so far:\n\\[ 96.00 + 24.00 = 120.00 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the total cost before the tip:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 120.00 = 24.00 \\]\n\nFinally, add the tip to the total cost:\n\\[ 120.00 + 24.00 = 144.00 \\]\n\nSo, the final bill total is:\n\\[ \\boxed{144.00} \\]",
