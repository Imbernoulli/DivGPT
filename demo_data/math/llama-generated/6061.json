        "To determine how old Mark's parents were when he was born, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine John's current age.\n2. Calculate the current age of Mark's parents.\n3. Find out how old Mark's parents were when Mark was born by subtracting Mark's current age from their current age.\n\nFirst, we know that John is 10 years younger than Mark. Since Mark is 18 years old, John's current age is:\n\\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Mark's parents are currently 5 times older than John. Therefore, the current age of Mark's parents is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nSince Mark is currently 18 years old, we need to find out how old Mark's parents were when he was born by subtracting 18 from their current age:\n\\[ 40 - 18 = 22 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nThus, Mark's parents were \\(\\boxed{22}\\) years old when Mark was born.",
