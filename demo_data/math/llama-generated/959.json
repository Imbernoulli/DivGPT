        "To determine how much water John uses in those 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of days in 4 weeks.\n2. Determine how many days John takes a shower in those 4 weeks.\n3. Calculate the total amount of water used in those showers.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of days in 4 weeks:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ weeks} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 28 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many days John takes a shower in those 28 days. Since he takes a shower every other day, we divide the total number of days by 2:\n\\[ 28 \\text{ days} \\div 2 = 14 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total amount of water used in those 14 showers. Each shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute and lasts 10 minutes, so each shower uses:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ gallons/minute} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} = 20 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nSince John takes 14 showers, the total amount of water used is:\n\\[ 14 \\text{ showers} \\times 20 \\text{ gallons/shower} = 280 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water John uses in those 4 weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{280} \\]",
