Convert the remaining distance into complete laps.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Albert has already run.**\n\nAlbert has run 6 times around the track. Since the track is 9 meters around, the total distance he has run is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 9 = 54 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the remaining distance Albert needs to run.**\n\nAlbert needs to run a total of 99 meters. After running 54 meters, the remaining distance he needs to run is:\n\\[ 99 - 54 = 45 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert the remaining distance into complete laps.**\n\nSince the track is 9 meters around, the number of complete laps Albert needs to run to cover the remaining 45 meters is:\n\\[ \\frac{45}{9} = 5 \\text{ laps} \\]\n\nTherefore, once Albert finishes running the remaining 45 meters, he will have made \\(\\boxed{5}\\) more complete laps around the track.",
        "To determine how many more complete laps Albert will have made around the track after finishing his 99-meter run, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total distance Albert has already run:**\n   Albert has run 6 times around the track. Since each lap is 9 meters, we multiply the number of laps by the length of each lap:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ laps} \\times 9 \\text{ meters per lap} = 54 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the remaining distance Albert needs to run:**\n   Albert's total goal is to run 99 meters. We subtract the distance he has already run from his goal:\n   \\[\n   99 \\text{ meters} - 54 \\text{ meters} = 45 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how many more complete laps Albert will run with the remaining distance:**\n   Each lap is 9 meters. To find out how many more complete laps he will run, we divide the remaining distance by the length of each lap:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{45 \\text{ meters}}{9 \\text{ meters per lap}} = 5 \\text{ laps}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, once Albert finishes his run, he will have made \\boxed{5} more complete laps around the track.",
