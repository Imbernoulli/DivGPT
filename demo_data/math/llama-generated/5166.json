        "To determine how much Tim paid for the cabinet after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discount amount.\n2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discount amount. The original price of the cabinet is $1200 and the discount is 15%. We can find the discount amount by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Discount amount} = 1200 \\times 0.15\n\\]\n\nPerform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Discount amount} = 180\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price Tim paid:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Final price} = 1200 - 180\n\\]\n\nPerform the subtraction:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Final price} = 1020\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Tim paid is \\(\\boxed{1020}\\).",
