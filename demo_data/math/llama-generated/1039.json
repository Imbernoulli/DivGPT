        "To determine how many hours William spent on the road, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total travel time from departure to arrival.\n2. Subtract the total time spent on stops from the total travel time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total travel time from departure to arrival. William left Missouri at 7:00 AM and arrived at his hometown at 8:00 PM. The time from 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM is 13 hours.\n\nNext, we need to find out the total time spent on stops.

        "To determine how many hours William spent on the road, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total travel time from departure to arrival:**\n   - Departure time: 7:00 AM\n   - Arrival time: 8:00 PM\n\n   First, convert the times to a 24-hour format for easier calculation:\n   - 7:00 AM is 07:00\n   - 8:00 PM is 20:00\n\n   Now, subtract the departure time from the arrival time:\n   \\[\n   20:00 - 07:00 = 13 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total time spent on stops:**\n   - William made three stops with the following durations:\n     - 25 minutes\n     - 10 minutes\n     - 25 minutes\n\n   Add the durations of all stops:\n   \\[\n   25 + 10 + 25 = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n   Convert the total stop time from minutes to hours:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ minutes} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time spent on the road:**\n   - Total travel time: 13 hours\n   - Total stop time: 1 hour\n\n   Subtract the total stop time from the total travel time:\n   \\[\n   13 \\text{ hours} - 1 \\text{ hour} = 12 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hours William spent on the road is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
        "To determine how many hours William spent on the road, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time William took for his journey, including the stops.\n2. Subtract the total time spent on stops from the total journey time to find the time spent on the road.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time William took for his journey. He left Missouri at 7:00 AM and arrived at his hometown at 8:00 PM. The time from 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM is 13 hours.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time spent on stops. William had three stops of 25 minutes, 10 minutes, and 25 minutes respectively. Adding these times together, we get:\n\\[ 25 + 10 + 25 = 60 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nSince 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, the total time spent on stops is 1 hour.\n\nNow, we subtract the total time spent on stops from the total journey time to find the time spent on the road:\n\\[ 13 \\text{ hours} - 1 \\text{ hour} = 12 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hours William spent on the road is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."
