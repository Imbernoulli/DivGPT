        "To determine the total number of text messages Keiko sent last week and this week combined, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of text messages Keiko sent last week.\n2. Calculate the number of text messages Keiko sent this week.\n3. Add the number of text messages sent last week to the number of text messages sent this week.\n\nFirst, we know from the problem statement that Keiko sent 111 text messages last week.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of text messages Keiko sent this week. According to the problem, she sent 50 less than double what she sent last week. We can express this mathematically as:\n\\[ \\text{:A工信部筥 this week} = 2 \\times \\text{text messages last week} - 50 \\]\nSubstituting the number of text messages sent last week (111) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ \\text{text messages this week} = 2 \\times 111 - 50 \\]\nFirst, we perform the multiplication:\n\\[ 2 \\times 111 = 222 \\]\nThen, we subtract 50 from 222:\n\\[ 222 - 50 = 172 \\]\nSo, Keiko sent 172 text messages this week.\n\nFinally, we add the number of text messages sent last week to the number of text messages sent this week to find the total number of text messages sent over the two weeks:\n\\[ \\text{total text messages} = \\text{text messages last week} + \\text{text messages this week} \\]\n\\[ \\text{total text messages} = 111 + 172 \\]\n\\[ \\text{total text messages} = 283 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of text messages Keiko sent last week and this week combined is \\(\\boxed{283}\\).",

We can express this mathematically as:\n\\[ \\text{ cropping녤 this week} = 2 \\times \\text{text messages last week} - 50 \\]\n\nSubstituting the number of text messages sent last week (111) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ \\text{text messages this week} = 2 \\times 111 - 50 \\]\n\\[ \\text{text messages this week} = 222 - 50 \\]\n\\[ \\text{text messages this week} = 172 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of text messages sent last week to the number of text messages sent this week to find the total number of text messages sent over the two weeks:\n\\[ \\text{total text messages} = \\text{text messages last week} + \\text{text messages this week} \\]\n\\[ \\text{total text messages} = 111 + 172 \\]\n\\[ \\text{total text messages} = 283 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of text messages Keiko sent last week and this week combined is \\(\\boxed{283}\\).",
