        "To determine the total number of birds in the crape myrtle tree, we need to find out how many cardinals, bluebirds, and swallows there are. We know the following:\n\n1. There are 2 swallows.\n2. There are half as many swallows as bluebirds.\n3. There are three times more cardinals than bluebirds.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of bluebirds. Since there are half as many swallows as bluebirds, we can express the number of bluebirds as:\n\\[ \\text{Number of bluebirds} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of swallows} = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\]\n\nNext, we find the number of cardinals. Since there are three times more cardinals than bluebirds, we can express the number of cardinals as:\n\\[ \\text{Number of cardinals} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of bluebirds} = 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\]\n\nNow, we add up the number of swallows, bluebirds, and cardinals to get the total number of birds in the tree:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of birds} = \\text{Number of swallows} + \\text{Number of bluebirds} + \\text{Number of cardinals} = 2 + 4 + 12 = 18 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of birds in the crape myrtle tree is:\n\\[ \\boxed{18} \\]",

Therefore, if there are 2 swallows, the number of bluebirds is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, there are 4 bluebirds.\n3. Determine the number of cardinals. The problem states that there are three times more cardinals than bluebirds. Therefore, if there are 4 bluebirds, the number of cardinals is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, there are 12 cardinals.\n4. Calculate the total number of birds by adding the number of swallows, bluebirds, and cardinals:\n   \\[\n   2 + 4 + 12 = 18\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of birds in the crape myrtle tree is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
