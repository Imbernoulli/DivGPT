        "To determine how many more games Perry won than Phil, we need to follow the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Determine how many games Charlie won:**\n   Phil won 12 games, and Phil won 3 games more than Charlie. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Phil's wins} = \\text{Charlie's wins} + 3\n   \\]\n   Given that Phil won 12 games:\n   \\[\n   12 = \\text{Charlie's wins} + 3\n   \\]\n   Solving for Charlie's wins:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Charlie's wins} = 12 - 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many games Dana won:**\n   Charlie won 2 games fewer than Dana. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Charlie's wins} = \\text{Dana's wins} - 2\n   \\]\n   Given that Charlie won 9 games:\n   \\[\n   9 = \\text{Dana's wins} - 2\n   \\]\n   Solving for Dana's wins:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Dana's wins} = 9 + 2 = 11\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many games Perry won:**\n   Perry won 5 more games than Dana. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perry's wins} = \\text{Dana's wins} + 5\n   \\]\n   Given that Dana won 11 games:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perry's wins} = 11 + 5 = 16\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate how many more games Perry won than Phil:**\n   Perry won 16 games, and Phil won 12 games. Therefore, the difference is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{Perry's wins} - \\text{Phil's wins} = 16 - 12 = 4\n   \\]\n\nThus, Perry won \\(\\boxed{4}\\) more games than Phil.",
        "To determine how many more games Perry won than Phil, we need to find out how many games each player won based on the given relationships and the total number of games Phil won.\n\n1. **Determine the number of games Charlie won:**\n   Phil won 12 games, and Phil won 3 games more than Charlie.
