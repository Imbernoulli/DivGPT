Since each hen lays 3 eggs a day and Myrtle has 3 hens, the total number of eggs laid each day is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hens} \\times 3 \\text{ eggs/hen/day} = 9 \\text{ eggs/day} \\]\n\nOver 7 days, the total number of eggs laid is:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ eggs/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 63 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of eggs taken by the neighbor. The neighbor took 12 eggs, so the number of eggs left is:\n\\[ 63 \\text{ eggs} - 12 \\text{ eggs} = 51 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nThen, we subtract the number of eggs Myrtle dropped. Myrtle dropped 5 eggs, so the number of eggs left after she drops them is:\n\\[ 51 \\text{ eggs} - 5 \\text{ eggs} = 46 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of eggs Myrtle has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{46} \\]",
