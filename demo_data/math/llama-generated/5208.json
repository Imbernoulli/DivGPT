        "To determine how many hours Vicky has to wait until the program is fully downloaded, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the program size from gigabytes (GB) to megabytes (MB):**\n   \\[\n   360 \\text{ GB} \\times 1000 \\text{ MB/GB} = 360,000 \\text{ MB}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the download time in seconds:**\n   Vicky's download speed is 50 MB/second. To find the total time required to download 360,000 MB, we divide the total size by the download speed:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{360,000 \\text{ MB}}{50 \\text{ MB/second}} = 7200 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the download time from seconds to hours:**\n   There are 3600 seconds in an hour.
