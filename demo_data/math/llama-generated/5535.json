        "To determine how many coconuts Dante has left after selling some, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find out how many coconuts Dante initially has:**\n   - Paolo has 14 coconuts.\n   - Dante has thrice as many coconuts as Paolo.\n   - Therefore, Dante's initial number of coconuts is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 14 = 42\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate how many coconuts Dante has after selling 10:**\n   - Dante initially has 42 coconuts.\n   - He sells 10 coconuts.\n   - The number of coconuts left is:\n     \\[\n     42 - 10 = 32\n     \\]\n\nThus, after selling 10 coconuts, Dante has \\boxed{32} coconuts left.",
        "To determine how many coconuts Dante has left after selling 10 of them, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many coconuts Dante originally had.\n2. Subtract the number of coconuts Dante sold from his original amount.\n\nFirst, we know that Paolo has 14 coconuts. Dante has thrice as many coconuts as Paolo.
