        "To determine how much weight John's toy bridge must hold up, we need to calculate the total weight of all the cans and their contents.

        "To determine the total weight that the bridge must hold up, we need to calculate the weight of all the cans, both full and empty. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the weight of the 6 full cans of soda:**\n   - Each can of soda contains 12 ounces of soda and weighs 2 ounces when empty.\n   - Therefore, the total weight of one full can is \\(12 + 2 = 14\\) ounces.\n   - Since there are 6 full cans, the total weight of the 6 full cans is \\(6 \\times 14 = 84\\) ounces.\n\n2. **Calculate the weight of the 2 empty cans:**\n   - Each empty can weighs 2 ounces.\n   - Since there are 2 empty cans, the total weight of the 2 empty cans is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) ounces.\n\n3. **Calculate the total weight of all the cans:**\n   - The total weight is the sum of the weight of the 6 full cans and the weight of the 2 empty cans.\n   - Therefore, the total weight is \\(84 + 4 = 88\\) ounces.\n\nSo, the bridge must hold up \\(\\boxed{88}\\) ounces.",
