Since 1 dozen equals 12 chocolates, we have:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ dozen} = 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ chocolates}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many 5-minute intervals there are in 4 hours:**\n   First, convert 4 hours into minutes:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\times 60 = 240 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n   Next, find out how many 5-minute intervals are in 240 minutes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{240 \\text{ minutes}}{5 \\text{ minutes/interval}} = 48 \\text{ intervals}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of chocolates Wendy can package in 48 intervals:**\n   Since Wendy packages 24 chocolates in each 5-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of chocolates per interval:\n   \\[\n   48 \\text{ intervals} \\times 24 \\text{ chocolates/interval} = 1152 \\text{ chocolates}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of individual chocolates Wendy can package in 4 hours is \\boxed{1152}.",
