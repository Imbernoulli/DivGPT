Calculate the jogging speed in miles per hour.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Jack needs to jog.**\n\nThe beach is 16 blocks away, and each block is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of a mile. Therefore, the total distance is:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ blocks} \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\text{ miles per block} = 2 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the time Jack has to jog.**\n\nJack has 10 minutes to jog.\n\n**Step 3: Convert the time from minutes to hours.**\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert 10 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = \\frac{10}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the jogging speed in miles per hour.**\n\nSpeed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time. So, we divide the total distance by the time Jack has:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{2 \\text{ miles}}{\\frac{1}{6} \\text{ hours}} = 2 \\text{ miles} \\times \\frac{6}{1} \\text{ hours}^{-1} = 12 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jack needs to jog at a speed of \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles per hour to get to the beach before the ice cream melts.",
