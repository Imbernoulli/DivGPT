        "To determine the total number of miles Jack has driven since he started driving, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of four-month periods in 9 years:**\n\n   There are 12 months in a year. Therefore, in 9 years, the total number of months is:\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ years} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 108 \\text{ months}\n   \\]\n\n   Since Jack drives every four months, we need to find out how many four-month periods are in 108 months:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{108 \\text{ months}}{4 \\text{ months/period}} = 27 \\text{ periods}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total miles driven in 27 four-month periods:**\n\n   Jack drives 37,000 miles in each four-month period. Therefore, the total number of miles he drives in 27 periods is:\n   \\[\n   27 \\text{ periods} \\times 37,000 \\text{ miles/period} = 999,000 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of miles Jack has driven since he started driving is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{999000}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of miles Jack has driven since he started driving, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many miles Jack drives in one year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the number of four-month periods in a year:\n\\[\n\\frac{12 \\text{ months}}{4 \\text{ months/period}} = 3 \\text{ periods/year}\n\\]\nNext, we know that Jack drives 37,000 miles every four months. Therefore, the number of miles he drives in one year is:\n\\[\n37,000 \\text{ miles/period} \\times 3 \\text{ periods/year} = 111,000 \\text{ miles/year}\n\\]\nJack has been driving for 9 years. To find the total number of miles he has driven over these 9 years, we multiply the annual mileage by the number of years:\n\\[\n111,000 \\text{ miles/year} \\times 9 \\text{ years} = 999,000 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\nThus, the total number of miles Jack has driven since he started driving is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{999000}\n\\]",

Determine the total number of years Jack has been driving.\n3. Multiply the annual mileage by the number of years he has been driving.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many miles Jack drives in one year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can divide 12 by 4 to find out how many four-month periods are in a year:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{4} = 3\n\\]\nThis means there are 3 four-month periods in a year.
