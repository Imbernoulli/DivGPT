She started with $20, so we subtract the cost of the books from her initial amount:\n\\[\n20 - 12 = 8\n\\]\nShelby has $8 left after buying the books. Since each poster costs $4, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one poster:\n\\[\n8 \\div 4 = 2\n\\]\nShelby can buy 2 posters. Therefore, the number of posters she can buy is \\boxed{2}.",
