The card labeled X is tagged with half the number W is tagged with.\n   \\[\n   X = \\frac{W}{2} = \\frac{200}{2} = 100\n   \\]\n\n3. The card labeled Y is tagged with the total of X and W's tags.\n   \\[\n   Y = X + W = 100 + 200 = 300\n   \\]\n\n4. The card labeled Z is tagged with the number 400.\n   \\[\n   Z = 400\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the values of all four cards:\n\\[\nW + X + Y + Z = 200 + 100 + 300 + 400\n\\]\n\nAdding these together step by step:\n\\[\n200 + 100 = 300\n\\]\n\\[\n300 + 300 = 600\n\\]\n\\[\n600 + 400 = 1000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total of all the tagged numbers is \\(\\boxed{1000}\\).",
