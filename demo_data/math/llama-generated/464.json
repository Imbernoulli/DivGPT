        "To determine the sum of Viggo's and his younger brother's ages, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Viggo's age when his brother was 2:**\n   - When Viggo's brother was 2 years old, Viggo was 10 years more than twice his brother's age.\n   - Twice his brother's age when he was 2 is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n   - Therefore, Viggo was \\(4 + 10 = 14\\) years old when his brother was 2.\n\n2. **Calculate the age difference between Viggo and his younger brother:**\n   - When Viggo was 14 years old, his brother was 2 years old.\n   - The age difference between them is \\(14 - 2 = 12\\) years.\n\n3. **Determine Viggo's current age:**\n   - currently, his brother is 10 years old.\n   - Since Viggo is 12 years older than his brother, Viggo's current age is \\(10 + 12 = 22\\) years old.\n\n4. **Calculate the sum of their current ages:**\n   - Viggo's current age is 22 years.\n   - His brother's current age is 10 years.\n   - The sum of their ages is \\(22 + 10 = 32\\).\n\nThus, the sum of Viggo's and his younger brother's ages is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",

According to the problem, Viggo's age was 10 years more than twice his younger brother's age when his brother was 2. We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Viggo's age when his brother was 2} = 2 \\times 2 + 10 = 4 + 10 = 14 \\]\n\nSo, Viggo was 14 years old when his brother was 2. Since his brother is currently 10 years old, we need to find out how many years have passed since his brother was 2. This can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \\]\n\nThis means that 8 years have passed since Viggo was 14 years old. Therefore, Viggo's current age is:\n\n\\[ 14 + 8 = 22 \\]\n\nNow, we know that Viggo is currently 22 years old and his brother is currently 10 years old. To find the sum of their ages, we add their current ages together:\n\n\\[ 22 + 10 = 32 \\]\n\nThus, the sum of Viggo's and his younger brother's ages is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]",

Therefore, Viggo's current age is:\n\n\\[ 14 + 8 = 22 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the sum of Viggo's and his younger brother's current ages:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sum of their ages} = 22 + 10 = 32 \\]\n\nThus, the sum of their ages is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]",

Since his brother was 2 years old, we calculate Viggo's age as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Viggo's age when his brother was 2} = 2 \\times 2 + 10 = 4 + 10 = 14\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much time has passed since Viggo's brother was 2 years old.

Therefore, Viggo's current age is:\n\n\\[ 14 + 8 = 22 \\]\n\nNow, we know that Viggo is currently 22 years old and his younger brother is currently 10 years old. To find the sum of their ages, we add their current ages together:\n\n\\[ 22 + 10 = 32 \\]\n\nThus, the sum of their ages is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]",
        "To determine the sum of Viggo's and his younger brother's ages, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Viggo's age when his brother was 2:**\n   - We know that when his brother was 2, Viggo's age was 10 years more than twice his brother's age.\n   - Twice his brother's age when he was 2 is \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\).\n   - Therefore, Viggo's age when his brother was 2 is \\( 4 + 10 = 14 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the age difference between Viggo and his younger brother:**\n   - When his brother was 2, Viggo was 14 years old.\n   - His younger brother is currently 10 years old.\n   - The age difference between Viggo and his younger brother is \\( 14 - 2 = 12 \\) years.\n\n3. **Determine Viggo's current age:**\n   - Since his younger brother is currently 10 years old, and Viggo is 12 years older, Viggo's current age is \\( 10 + 12 = 22 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the sum of their current ages:**\n   - Viggo's current age is 22.\n   - His younger brother's current age is 10.\n   - The sum of their ages is \\( 22 + 10 = 32 \\).\n\nThus, the sum of Viggo's and his younger brother's ages is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
