        "To determine the new price of the movie ticket after a 20% decrease, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of the decrease.\n2. Subtract the decrease from the original price.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of the decrease. The original price of the movie ticket is $100, and the decrease is 20%. We can find 20% of $100 by multiplying $100 by 0.20:\n\n\\[ 100 \\times 0.20 = 20 \\]\n\nSo, the decrease in price is $20.\n\nNext, we subtract the decrease from the original price to find the new price:\n\n\\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \\]\n\nTherefore, the new price of the movie ticket is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
