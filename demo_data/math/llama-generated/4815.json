He sees one crane that is 228 feet tall finishing a building that was 200 feet tall. He sees another that is 120 feet tall finishing a building that is 100 feet tall. The final crane he sees is 147 feet tall, finishing a building that is 140 feet tall. On average, what percentage taller are the cranes than the building?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
