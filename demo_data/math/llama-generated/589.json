        "To find the total ticket revenue for the movie session, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of adults in the theatre.\n2. Calculate the revenue from adult tickets.\n3. Calculate the revenue from child tickets.\n4. Add the revenues from adult and child tickets to get the total revenue.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of adults in the theatre. The theatre has 250 seats and is full, so it contains 250 people. Out of these, 188 are children. Therefore, the number of adults is:\n\\[ 250 - 188 = 62 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the revenue from adult tickets. The cost of an adult ticket is $6, so the revenue from adult tickets is:\n\\[ 62 \\times 6 = 372 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the revenue from child tickets. The cost of a child ticket is $4, so the revenue from child tickets is:\n\\[ 188 \\times 4 = 752 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the revenues from adult and child tickets to get the total revenue:\n\\[ 372 + 752 = 1124 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total ticket revenue for this movie session is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1124} \\]",

Calculate the revenue from adult tickets.\n3. Calculate the revenue from child tickets.\n4. Add the revenues from adult and child tickets to get the total revenue.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of adults. The theatre has 250 seats and is full, so it contains 250 people in total. Out of these, 188 are children. Therefore, the number of adults is:\n\\[ 250 - 188 = 62 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the revenue from adult tickets. The cost of an adult ticket is $6, and there are 62 adults, so the revenue from adult tickets is:\n\\[ 62 \\times 6 = 372 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the revenue from child tickets. The cost of a child ticket is $4, and there are 188 children, so the revenue from child tickets is:\n\\[ 188 \\times 4 = 752 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the revenues from adult and child tickets to get the total revenue:\n\\[ 372 + 752 = 1124 \\]\n\nThus, the total ticket revenue for this movie session is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1124} \\]",
        "To determine the total ticket revenue for the movie session, we need to calculate the revenue from adult tickets and the revenue from child tickets separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many adults are in the theatre.

Therefore, the number of adults is:\n\\[\n250 - 188 = 62\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the revenue from adult tickets. The cost of an adult ticket is $6, and there are 62 adults.

Therefore, the number of adults is:\n\\[ 250 - 188 = 62 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the revenue from the adult tickets. Since each adult ticket costs $6, the total revenue from the adult tickets is:\n\\[ 62 \\times 6 = 372 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the revenue from the child tickets. Since each child ticket costs $4, the total revenue from the child tickets is:\n\\[ 188 \\times 4 = 752 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the revenue from the adult tickets and the child tickets to get the total revenue:\n\\[ 372 + 752 = 1124 \\]\n\nThus, the total ticket revenue for this movie session is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1124} \\]",

Therefore, the number of adults is:\n\\[ 250 - 188 = 62 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the revenue from the adult tickets. The cost of an adult ticket is $6, and there are 62 adults. So, the revenue from the adult tickets is:\n\\[ 62 \\times 6 = 372 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the revenue from the child tickets. The cost of a child ticket is $4, and there are 188 children. So, the revenue from the child tickets is:\n\\[ 188 \\times 4 = 752 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the revenue from the adult tickets and the child tickets to get the total revenue:\n\\[ 372 + 752 = 1124 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total ticket revenue for this movie session is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1124} \\]",
