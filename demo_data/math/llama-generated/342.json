The press prints 20 single-page spreads, and twice as many double-page spreads. For each 4 pages printed for the spreads, the press prints a block of 4 ads, each of which take up a quarter of a page. The brochures can be arranged in any order as long as they are made up of 5 pages each. How many brochures is the printing press creating?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total number of brochures the printing press is creating, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pages printed for the spreads:**\n   - The press prints 20 single-page spreads. Therefore, the number of pages from single-page spreads is:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 1 = 20\n     \\]\n   - The press prints twice as many double-page spreads as single-page spreads. Therefore, the number of double-page spreads is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 20 = 40\n     \\]\n   - Each double-page spread consists of 2 pages. Therefore, the number of pages from double-page spreads is:\n     \\[\n     40 \\times 2 = 80\n     \\]\n   - Adding the pages from single-page and double-page spreads gives:\n     \\[\n     20 + 80 = 100\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of pages printed for the ads:**\n   - For every 4 pages printed for the spreads, the press prints a block of 4 ads. Therefore, the number of blocks of ads is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{100}{4} = 25\n     \\]\n   - Each block of ads consists of 4 ads, and each ad takes up a quarter of a page. Therefore, the number of pages from the ads is:\n     \\[\n     25 \\times 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 25\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of pages printed:**\n   - Adding the pages from the spreads and the pages from the ads gives:\n     \\[\n     100 + 25 = 125\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of brochures:**\n   - Each brochure consists of 5 pages.
