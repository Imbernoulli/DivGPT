        "To find the total number of books in the library, we need to determine how many books are intended for children and then add that to the number of books intended for adults.\n\nFirst, let's denote the total number of books in the library by \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, 35% of the books are intended for children. Therefore, the number of books intended for children is:\n\\[ 0.35x \\]\n\nThe number of books intended for adults is given as 104. Since the total number of books is the sum of the books intended for children and the books intended for adults, we can write the equation:\n\\[ x = 0.35x + 104 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting \\( 0.35x \\) from both sides:\n\\[ x - 0.35x = 104 \\]\n\\[ 0.65x = 104 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 0.65:\n\\[ x = \\frac{104}{0.65} \\]\n\\[ x = 160 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of books in the library is:\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of books in the library, we need to consider the information given about the distribution of the books. We know that 35% of the books are intended for children, which implies that the remaining 65% of the books are intended for adults. We are also given that there are 104 adult books.\n\nLet's denote the total number of books in the library by \\( x \\). According to the problem, 65% of the total number of books is equal to 104. We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\\[\n0.65x = 104\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we need to solve the equation by isolating \\( x \\). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.65:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{104}{0.65}\n\\]\n\nNext, we perform the division:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{104 \\div 0.65} = \\frac{104 \\times 100}{0.65 \\times 100} = \\frac{10400}{65}\n\\]\n\nNow, we simplify the fraction:\n\\[\nx = 160\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of books in the library is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
