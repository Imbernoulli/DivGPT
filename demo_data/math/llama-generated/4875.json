        "To determine the total number of fish that Micah, Kenneth, and Matthias have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many fish Kenneth has.\n2. Find out how many fish Matthias has.\n3. Add the number of fish each boy has to get the total.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many fish Kenneth has. Kenneth has three times as many fish as Micah. Since Micah has 7 fish, we calculate:\n\\[\n3 \\times 7 = 21\n\\]\nSo, Kenneth has 21 fish.\n\nNext, let's find out how many fish Matthias has. Matthias has 15 less fish than Kenneth. Since Kenneth has 21 fish, we calculate:\n\\[\n21 - 15 = 6\n\\]\nSo, Matthias has 6 fish.\n\nNow, we add the number of fish each boy has to get the total:\n\\[\n7 + 21 + 6 = 34\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of fish the boys have is \\boxed{34}.",
