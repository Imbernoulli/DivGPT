Each car on a road pollutes 10 pounds of carbon a year. A single bus pollutes 100 pounds of carbon a year. A bus can hold 40 people. The town decides to start running a bus and 25% of the people who used to drive now take the bus. How many fewer pounds of carbon are now emitted per year?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many fewer pounds of carbon are now emitted per year after the town starts running a bus, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total carbon emissions from the cars before the bus is introduced.\n2. Determine the number of people who now take the bus and the number of people who still drive.\n3. Calculate the total carbon emissions from the bus and the remaining cars.\n4. Find the difference between the original carbon emissions and the new carbon emissions.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total carbon emissions from the cars before the bus is introduced.**\n\nThe population of Johnstown is 80, and each car pollutes 10 pounds of carbon a year. Therefore, the total carbon emissions from the cars is:\n\\[ 80 \\text{ cars} \\times 10 \\text{ pounds/car} = 800 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of people who now take the bus and the number of people who still drive.**\n\nThe town decides to start running a bus and 25% of the people who used to drive now take the bus. So, the number of people who take the bus is:\n\\[ 80 \\text{ people} \\times 0.25 = 20 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nThe number of people who still drive is:\n\\[ 80 \\text{ people} - 20 \\text{ people} = 60 \\text{ people} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total carbon emissions from the bus and the remaining cars.**\n\nA single bus pollutes 100 pounds of carbon a year. Therefore, the carbon emissions from the bus is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThe carbon emissions from the remaining cars is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ cars} \\times 10 \\text{ pounds/car} = 600 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSo, the total carbon emissions from the bus and the remaining cars is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ pounds} + 600 \\text{ pounds} = 700 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the difference between the original carbon emissions and the new carbon emissions.**\n\nThe original carbon emissions were 800 pounds, and the new carbon emissions are 700 pounds. Therefore, the difference is:\n\\[ 800 \\text{ pounds} - 700 \\text{ pounds} = 100 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSo, the town now emits \\(\\boxed{100}\\) fewer pounds of carbon per year.",
