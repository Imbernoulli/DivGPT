        "To determine how many dozen cupcakes Lillian can bake and ice with the sugar she has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of sugar Lillian has:**\n   - Lillian starts with 3 cups of sugar.\n   - She buys 2 bags of sugar, and each bag contains 6 cups.\n   - Total sugar from the bags: \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) cups.\n   - Total sugar available: \\(3 + 12 = 15\\) cups.\n\n2. **Determine the sugar needed for the batter and the frosting:**\n   - Sugar needed for the batter: 1 cup per 12 cupcakes.\n   - Sugar needed for the frosting: 2 cups per 12 cupcakes.\n   - Total sugar needed per dozen cupcakes: \\(1 + 2 = 3\\) cups.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of dozen cupcakes Lillian can make:**\n   - Total sugar available: 15 cups.\n   - Sugar needed per dozen cupcakes: 3 cups.\n   - Number of dozen cupcakes: \\(\\frac{15}{3} = 5\\).\n\nTherefore, Lillian can bake and ice \\(\\boxed{5}\\) dozen cupcakes with the sugar she has.",
        "First, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar Lillian has. She starts with 3 cups of sugar and buys 2 bags of sugar, with each bag containing 6 cups. So, the total amount of sugar she buys is:\n\\[2 \\times 6 = 12 \\text{ cups}\\]\nAdding this to the 3 cups she already has, the total amount of sugar she has is:\n\\[3 + 12 = 15 \\text{ cups}\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much sugar is required to bake and ice a certain number of cupcakes. The batter uses 1 cup of sugar per 12 cupcakes, and the frosting uses 2 cups of sugar per 12 cupcakes. Therefore, the total amount of sugar needed for one dozen cupcakes is:\n\\[1 + 2 = 3 \\text{ cups}\\]\n\nTo find out how many dozen cupcakes Lillian can bake and ice with 15 cups of sugar, we divide the total amount of sugar she has by the amount of sugar needed per dozen cupcakes:\n\\[15 \\div 3 = 5\\]\n\nThus, Lillian can bake and ice \\(\\boxed{5}\\) dozen cupcakes with the sugar she has.",
