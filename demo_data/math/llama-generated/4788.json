        "To determine how much time Tim spends reading in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the amount of time Tim spends meditating each day.\n2. Calculate the amount of time Tim spends reading each day.\n3. Determine the total amount of time Tim spends reading in a week.\n\nStep 1: Identify the amount of time Tim spends meditating each day.\nTim spends 1 hour a day meditating.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the amount of time Tim spends reading each day.\nTim spends twice as much time reading as he does meditating. Therefore, the time he spends reading each day is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ hour/day} \\times 2 = 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\]\n\nStep 3: Determine the total amount of time Tim spends reading in a week.\nThere are 7 days in a week. So, the total time he spends reading in a week is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 14 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nThus, the total time Tim spends reading in a week is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",

Determine the weekly time Tim spends reading.\n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - So, the weekly time spent reading is \\( 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\) hours.\n\nThus, the total time Tim spends reading in a week is \\(\\boxed{14}\\) hours.",
        "To determine how much time Tim spends reading in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how much time Tim spends meditating each day.\n2. Calculate how much time Tim spends reading each day.\n3. Determine how much time Tim spends reading in a week.\n\nFirst, we know that Tim spends 1 hour a day meditating. Since he spends twice as much time reading as he does meditating, we can calculate the time he spends reading each day as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 1 \\text{ hour} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much time Tim spends reading in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily reading time by 7:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 14 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Tim spends reading in a week is \\(\\boxed{14}\\) hours.",
