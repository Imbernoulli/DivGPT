They buy a giant sheet to turn into a balloon for $42, a rope for $18, and a propane tank and burner for $14. They plan to use the rest of the money on helium. The helium is $1.50 per ounce. For every ounce they buy, the balloon can fly 113 feet higher. How many feet up can they fly the balloon?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how high Harry and Kevin can fly their helium balloon, we first need to calculate how much money they have left after purchasing the necessary items. The items they bought and their costs are:\n\n- A giant sheet for $42\n- A rope for $18\n- A propane tank and burner for $14\n\nFirst, we add up the costs of these items:\n\\[ 42 + 18 + 14 = 74 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount of money they had:\n\\[ 200 - 74 = 126 \\]\n\nThis means they have $126 left to spend on helium. The cost of helium is $1.50 per ounce. To find out how many ounces of helium they can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost per ounce:\n\\[ 126 \\div 1.50 = 84 \\]\n\nSo, they can buy 84 ounces of helium. Since each ounce of helium allows the balloon to fly 113 feet higher, we multiply the number of ounces by the height each ounce provides:\n\\[ 84 \\times 113 = 9492 \\]\n\nTherefore, the balloon can fly \\(\\boxed{9492}\\) feet up.",
