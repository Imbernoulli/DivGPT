        "To determine how far apart Ann and Glenda are after skating in opposite directions for 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then sum those distances.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Ann travels:\n- Ann's speed is 6 miles per hour.\n- She skates for 3 hours.\n- Distance traveled by Ann = speed × time = 6 miles/hour × 3 hours = 18 miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance Glenda travels:\n- Glenda's speed is 8 miles per hour.\n- She skates for 3 hours.\n- Distance traveled by Glenda = speed × time = 8 miles/hour × 3 hours = 24 miles.\n\nSince Ann and Glenda are skating in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled:\n- Total distance apart = distance traveled by Ann + distance traveled by Glenda = 18 miles + 24 miles = 42 miles.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",
