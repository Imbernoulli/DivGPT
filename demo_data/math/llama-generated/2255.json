        "To determine the total number of sours Sally has in the bag, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of lemon sours:**\n   - Sally scoops 32 cherry sours.\n   - The ratio of cherry sours to lemon sours is 4:5.\n   - Let \\( L \\) be the number of lemon sours.\n   - According to the ratio, we can set up the proportion:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{32}{L}\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( L \\):\n     \\[\n     4L = 5 \\times 32\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     4L = 160\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     L = \\frac{160}{4}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     L = 40\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of orange sours:**\n   - Sally scoops 40 lemon sours.\n   - The total number of sours after adding lemon sours is:\n     \\[\n     32 + 40 = 72\n     \\]\n   - Sally then gets a scoop of orange sours, and they make up 25% of the total sours in the bag.\n   - Let \\( O \\) be the number of orange sours.\n   - According to the problem:\n     \\[\n     O = 0.25 \\times (72 + O)\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( O \\):\n     \\[\n     O = 0.25 \\times 72 + 0.25O\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     O = 18 + 0.25O\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     O - 0.25O = 18\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     0.75O = 18\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     O = \\frac{18}{0.75}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     O = 24\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of sours:**\n   - The total number of sours is the sum of cherry sours, lemon sours, and orange sours:\n     \\[\n     32 + 40 + 24 = 96\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of sours Sally has in the bag is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
        "Let's start by determining the number of lemon sours Sally scoops. We know that the ratio of cherry sours to lemon sours is 4:5. Since Sally scoops 32 cherry sours, we can set up the proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{32}{\\text{lemon sours}} = \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\nTo find the number of lemon sours, we solve for the unknown value:\n\n\\[\n32 \\times 5 = 4 \\times \\text{lemon sours} \\implies 160 = 4 \\times \\text{lemon sours} \\implies \\text{lemon sours} = \\frac{160}{4} = 40\n\\]\n\nSo, Sally scoops 40 lemon sours. Next, we know that the orange sours make up 25% of the total sours in the bag. Let's denote the total number of sours as \\( T \\). Since the orange sours make up 25% of the total, they make up \\( \\frac{T}{4} \\). The total number of sours is the sum of the cherry sours, lemon sours, and orange sours:\n\n\\[\nT = 32 + 40 + \\frac{T}{4}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( T \\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 4:\n\n\\[\n4T = 4 \\times 32 + 4 \\times 40 + T \\implies 4T = 128 + 160 + T \\implies 4T = 288 + T\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( T \\) by subtracting \\( T \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n4T - T = 288 \\implies 3T = 288 \\implies T = \\frac{288}{3} = 96\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of sours Sally has in the bag is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{96}\n\\]",

According to the ratio, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{32}{L} = \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( L \\), we can cross-multiply:\n\n\\[\n32 \\cdot 5 = 4 \\cdot L \\implies 160 = 4L \\implies L = \\frac{160}{4} = 40\n\\]\n\nSo, Sally scoops 40 lemon sours. Now, let's determine the total number of sours after scooping the cherry sours and lemon sours. The total number of sours at this point is:\n\n\\[\n32 + 40 = 72\n\\]\n\nNext, Sally gets a scoop of orange sours. We know that the orange sours make up 25% of the total sours in the bag. Let's denote the number of orange sours by \\( O \\). According to the problem, the orange sours make up 25% of the total number of sours, so:\n\n\\[\nO = 0.25 \\times (72 + O)\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( O \\), we can solve the equation:\n\n\\[\nO = 0.25 \\times 72 + 0.25 \\times O \\implies O = 18 + 0.25O \\implies O - 0.25O = 18 \\implies 0.75O = 18 \\implies O = \\frac{18}{0.75} = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, Sally scoops 24 orange sours.

According to the ratio, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{32}{L} = \\frac{4}{5}\n   \\]\n   To find \\( L \\), we can solve the proportion by cross-multiplying:\n   \\[\n   32 \\times 5 = 4 \\times L\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   160 = 4L\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{160}{4} = 40\n   \\]\n   So, Sally has 40 lemon sours.\n\n2. **Determine the number of orange sours:**\n   Sally then gets a scoop of orange sours, and they make up 25% of the sours in the bag. Let \\( O \\) be the number of orange sours. The total number of sours in the bag after adding the orange sours is \\( 32 + 40 + O \\). According to the problem, the orange sours make up 25% of the total sours, so:\n   \\[\n   O = 0.25 \\times (32 + 40 + O)\n   \\]\n   First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n   \\[\n   O = 0.25 \\times (72 + O)\n   \\]\n   Next, distribute the 0.25:\n   \\[\n   O = 18 + 0.25O\n   \\]\n   To isolate \\( O \\), subtract \\( 0.25O \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   O - 0.25O = 18\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0.75O = 18\n   \\]\n   Finally, solve for \\( O \\) by dividing both sides by 0.75:\n   \\[\n   O = \\frac{18}{0.75} = 24\n   \\]\n   So, Sally has 24 orange sours.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of sours:**\n   The total number of sours in the bag is the sum of the cherry sours, lemon sours, and orange sours:\n   \\[\n   32 + 40 + 24 = 96\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of sours Sally has in the bag is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
        "Let's denote the number of lemon sours that Sally scoops as \\( L \\). According to the problem, the ratio of cherry sours to lemon sours is 4:5. Since Sally scoops 32 cherry sours, we can set up the following proportion based on the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{32}{L} = \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( L \\), we can solve the proportion by cross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n32 \\cdot 5 = 4 \\cdot L\n\\]\n\\[\n160 = 4L\n\\]\n\\[\nL = \\frac{160}{4} = 40\n\\]\n\nSo, Sally scoops 40 lemon sours. Next, she gets a scoop of orange sours, and they make up 25% of the total sours in the bag. Let's denote the total number of sours in the bag as \\( T \\). Since the orange sours make up 25% of the total sours, they are equal to \\( 0.25T \\). The total number of sours in the bag is the sum of the cherry sours, lemon sours, and orange sours:\n\n\\[\nT = 32 + 40 + O\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( O \\) is the number of orange sours. Since the orange sours are 25% of the total sours, we can also write:\n\n\\[\nO = 0.25T\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( O = 0.25T \\) into the equation \\( T = 32 + 40 + O \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nT = 32 + 40 + 0.25T\n\\]\n\\[\nT = 72 + 0.25T\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( T \\), we need to isolate \\( T \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting \\( 0.25T \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\nT - 0.25T = 72\n\\]\n\\[\n0.75T = 72\n\\]\n\\[\nT = \\frac{72}{0.75} = 96\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of sours Sally has in the bag is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{96}\n\\]",
