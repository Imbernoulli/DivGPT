        "To determine how many shirts Steven has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many shirts Andrew has.\n2. Use the number of shirts Andrew has to find out how many shirts Steven has.\n\nFirst, we know that Brian has 3 shirts. According to the problem, Andrew has 6 times as many shirts as Brian. Therefore, we can calculate the number of shirts Andrew has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of shirts Andrew has} = 6 \\times \\text{Number of shirts Brian has} = 6 \\times 3 = 18\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Steven has 4 times as many shirts as Andrew. Therefore, we can calculate the number of shirts Steven has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of shirts Steven has} = 4 \\times \\text{Number of shirts Andrew has} = 4 \\times 18 = 72\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of shirts Steven has is \\boxed{72}.",
