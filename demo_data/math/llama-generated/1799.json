        "To determine the total number of minutes of video John releases per week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total length of videos John releases in one day.\n2. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many minutes of video John releases in one day. John releases two short videos that are each 2 minutes long and one long video that is 6 times as long as a short video. The length of the long video is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we add the lengths of all the videos released in one day:\n\\[ 2 + 2 + 12 = 16 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many minutes of video John releases in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:\n\\[ 16 \\times 7 = 112 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of minutes of video John releases per week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{112} \\]",
