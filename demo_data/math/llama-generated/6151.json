        "To determine the number of important emails in Antonia's inbox, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of spam emails.\n2. Determine the number of remaining emails after subtracting the spam emails.\n3. Calculate the number of promotional messages.\n4. Find the number of important emails by subtracting the number of spam emails and promotional messages from the total number of emails.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The total number of emails Antonia received is 400. The fraction of spam emails is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of spam emails} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 400 = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of spam emails from the total number of emails to find the number of remaining emails.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining emails} = 400 - 100 = 300\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of promotional emails. The fraction of promotional emails among the remaining emails is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of promotional emails} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 300 = 120\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of spam emails and promotional emails from the total number of emails to find the number of important emails.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of important emails} = 400 - 100 - 120 = 180\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of important emails in Antonia's inbox is \\(\\boxed{180}\\).",
