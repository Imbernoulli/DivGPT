        "To determine how much Amanda would save by buying 24 lighters online instead of at the gas station, we need to calculate the total cost of the lighters in both scenarios and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of 24 lighters at the gas station:\n- Each lighter costs $1.75.\n- Therefore, the cost for 24 lighters is:\n  \\[\n  24 \\times 1.75\n  \\]\n\n  We can break down the multiplication for clarity:\n  \\[\n  24 \\times 1.75 = 24 \\times \\left(2 - 0.25\\right) = 24 \\times 2 - 24 \\times 0.25\n  \\]\n\n  Calculate each part:\n  \\[\n  24 \\times 2 = 48\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  24 \\times 0.25 = 6\n  \\]\n\n  Subtract the second part from the first:\n  \\[\n  48 - 6 = 42\n  \\]\n\n  So, the total cost at the gas station is:\n  \\[\n  \\$42\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of 24 lighters on Amazon:\n- Each pack of twelve lighters costs $5.00.\n- Amanda needs 24 lighters, which is equivalent to 2 packs of twelve lighters.\n- Therefore, the cost for 24 lighters is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 5.00\n  \\]\n\n  Calculate the multiplication:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 5.00 = 10\n  \\]\n\n  So, the total cost on Amazon is:\n  \\[\n  \\$10\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost on Amazon from the total cost at the gas station:\n\\[\n42 - 10 = 32\n\\]\n\nThus, Amanda would save:\n\\[\n\\boxed{32}\n\\] dollars by buying 24 lighters online instead of at the gas station.",
