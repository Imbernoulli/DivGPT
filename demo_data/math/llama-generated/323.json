Unfortunately, one-tenth of the time, the audience member never reappears. However, one-fifth of the time, two people reappear instead of only one. If the magician has put on 100 performances of the act this year, how many people have reappeared?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many people have reappeared after the magician has performed his disappearing act 100 times, we need to consider the probabilities and outcomes for each performance.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected number of people reappearing from one performance. There are three possible outcomes:\n1. The audience member never reappears.\n2. One person reappears.\n3. Two people reappear.\n\nThe probabilities for these outcomes are:\n- The probability that the audience member never reappears is \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\).\n- The probability that one person reappears is \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{1}{5} = 1 - \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{7}{10} \\).\n- The probability that two people reappear is \\( \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{10} \\).\n\nThe expected number of people reappearing from one performance is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{7}{10} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{10} = 0 + \\frac{7}{10} + \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{11}{10} = 1.1\n\\]\n\nSince the magician has performed the act 100 times, the total expected number of people reappearing is:\n\\[\n100 \\times 1.1 = 110\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who have reappeared is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of people who have reappeared after the magician's之处 acts, we need to analyze the outcomes and their probabilities. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of times each outcome occurs:**\n   - The probability that an audience member never reappears is \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\).\n   - The probability that two people reappear instead of one is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n   - The probability that exactly one person reappears is \\(1 - \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{1}{5} = 1 - \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{7}{10}\\).\n\n   Since the magician has performed the act 100 times, we can calculate the number of times each outcome occurs:\n   - The number of times no one reappears is \\(100 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = 10\\).\n   - The number of times two people reappear is \\(100 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 20\\).\n   - The number of times one person reappears is \\(100 \\times \\frac{7}{10} = 70\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of people who have reappeared:**\n   - For the 10 times no one reappears, the total number of people who reappear is \\(10 \\times 0 = 0\\).\n   - For the 20 times two people reappear, the total number of people who reappear is \\(20 \\times 2 = 40\\).\n   - For the 70 times one person reappears, the total number of people who reappear is \\(70 \\times 1 = 70\\).\n\n   Adding these together gives the total number of people who have reappeared:\n   \\[\n   0 + 40 + 70 = 110\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who have reappeared is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",
        "To determine how many people have reappeared after the magician has performed his disappearing act 100 times, we need to break down the problem into parts based on the probabilities given.\n\n1.

Calculate the number of times two people reappear.\n   - The probability that two people reappear is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n   - Therefore, the number of times two people reappear is \\(100 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 20\\).\n\n3. Calculate the number of times one person reappears.\n   - The probability that one person reappears is the remaining probability after accounting for the cases where no one reappears and two people reappear.\n   - The probability that one person reappears is \\(1 - \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{1}{5} = 1 - \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{2}{10} = 1 - \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{7}{10}\\).\n   - Therefore, the number of times one person reappears is \\(100 \\times \\frac{7}{10} = 70\\).\n\n4. Calculate the total number of people who have reappeared.\n   - The total number of people who have reappeared is the sum of the people who reappeared in each scenario.\n   - This is \\(0 \\times 10 + 2 \\times 20 + 1 \\times 70 = 0 + 40 + 70 = 110\\).\n\nThus, the total number of people who have reappeared is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",

One-tenth of the time, the audience member never reappears.\n2. One-fifth of the time, two people reappear.\n3. The remaining fraction of the time, only one person reappears.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of performances for each outcome:\n- The number of performances where the audience member never reappears is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{10} \\times 100 = 10\n  \\]\n- The number of performances where two people reappear is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{5} \\times 100 = 20\n  \\]\n- The number of performances where only one person reappears is:\n  \\[\n  100 - 10 - 20 = 70\n  \\]\n\nNext, calculate the total number of people who reappeared for each outcome:\n- For the performances where the audience member never reappears, the total number of people who reappeared is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 0 = 0\n  \\]\n- For the performances where two people reappear, the total number of people who reappeared is:\n  \\[\n  20 \\times 2 = 40\n  \\]\n- For the performances where only one person reappears, the total number of people who reappeared is:\n  \\[\n  70 \\times 1 = 70\n  \\]\n\nFinally, add up the total number of people who reappeared from all the performances:\n\\[\n0 + 40 + 70 = 110\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of people who have reappeared is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of people who have reappeared after the magician has performed 100 disappearing acts, we need to account for the different outcomes and their probabilities.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of times each outcome occurs:**\n   - The probability that an audience member never reappears is \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\).\n   - The probability that two people reappear is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n   - The probability that exactly one person reappears is \\(1 - \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\nFirst, convert \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) to a fraction with a denominator of 10:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{10}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the probability that exactly one person reappears:\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{2}{10} = 1 - \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{7}{10}\n\\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of each outcome in 100 performances:**\n   - Number of times no one reappears:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{10} \\times 100 = 10\n     \\]\n   - Number of times two people reappear:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{5} \\times 100 = 20\n     \\]\n   - Number of times one person reappears:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{7}{10} \\times 100 = 70\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of people who have reappeared:**\n   - People who reappeared 0 times: \\(0 \\times 10 = 0\\)\n   - People who reappeared 2 times: \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\)\n   - People who reappeared 1 time: \\(1 \\times 70 = 70\\)\n\nAdd these amounts together:\n\\[\n0 + 40 + 70 = 110\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who have reappeared is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",
