        "To determine the total number of marbles Alex has, we need to calculate the number of black marbles and yellow marbles Alex possesses separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many black marbles Alex has. Lorin has 4 black marbles, and Alex has twice as many black marbles as Lorin. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n2 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\nSo, Alex has 8 black marbles.\n\nNext, let's find out how many yellow marbles Alex has. Jimmy has 22 yellow marbles, and Alex has one half as many yellow marbles as Jimmy. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{22}{2} = 11\n\\]\nSo, Alex has 11 yellow marbles.\n\nNow, we add the number of black marbles and yellow marbles Alex has to find the total number of marbles:\n\\[\n8 + 11 = 19\n\\]\nSo, the total number of marbles Alex has is \\boxed{19}.",

Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{22}{2} = 11\n\\]\nSo, Alex has 11 yellow marbles.\n\nNow, we add the number of black marbles and yellow marbles Alex has to find the total number of marbles:\n\\[\n8 + 11 = 19\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of marbles Alex has is \\boxed{19}.",
        "To determine the total number of marbles Alex has, we need to calculate the number of black and yellow marbles Alex possesses separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we find out how many black marbles Alex has. Lorin has 4 black marbles, and Alex has twice as many black marbles as Lorin. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n2 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\nSo, Alex has 8 black marbles.\n\nNext, we find out how many yellow marbles Alex has. Jimmy has 22 yellow marbles, and Alex has one half as many yellow marbles as Jimmy. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{22}{2} = 11\n\\]\nSo, Alex has 11 yellow marbles.\n\nTo find the total number of marbles Alex has, we add the number of black marbles and the number of yellow marbles:\n\\[\n8 + 11 = 19\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of marbles Alex has is \\boxed{19}.",
