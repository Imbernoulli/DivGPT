        "To determine how many years older Lavinia's son is than Lavinia's daughter, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the age of Katie's daughter.\n2.

Find the difference between the age of Lavinia's son and the age of Lavinia's daughter.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- Katie's daughter is 12 years old.\n\nNext, we calculate the age of Lavinia's daughter. According to the problem, Lavinia's daughter is 10 years younger than Katie's daughter:\n\\[ \\text{Age of Lavinia's daughter} = \\text{Age of Katie's daughter} - 10 = 12 - 10 = 2 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the age of Lavinia's son. The problem states that Lavinia's son is 2 times the age of Katie's daughter:\n\\[ \\text{Age of Lavinia's son} = 2 \\times \\text{Age of Katie's daughter} = 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the age of Lavinia's son and the age of Lavinia's daughter:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Age of Lavinia's son} - \\text{Age of Lavinia's daughter} = 24 - 2 = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, Lavinia's son is \\(\\boxed{22}\\) years older than Lavinia's daughter.",
