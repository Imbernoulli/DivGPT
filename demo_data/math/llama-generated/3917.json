        "To determine the total number of novels and writing books Edith has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of novels Edith has.\n2. Determine the number of writing books Edith has based on the information given.\n3. Add the number of novels and writing books together.\n\nFirst, we know that Edith has 80 novels. According to the problem, she has half as many novels as the number of writing books she has. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of writing books:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of writing books} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of novels}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the number of novels into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of writing books} = 2 \\times 80 = 160\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of novels and the number of writing books to find the total number of books Edith has:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of books} = \\text{Number of novels} + \\text{Number of writing books} = 80 + 160 = 240\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of novels and writing books Edith has is \\boxed{240}.",

Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of writing books:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of writing books} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of novels}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the number of novels into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of writing books} = 2 \\times 80 = 160\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of novels and the number of writing books to find the total number of books:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of books} = \\text{Number of novels} + \\text{Number of writing books} = 80 + 160 = 240\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of novels and writing books Edith has is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{240}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of novels and writing books Edith has, we start by identifying the number of writing books sherelative to the number of novels.

According to the problem, Edith has 80 novels.\n2. Determine the number of writing books Edith has. The problem states that she has twice as many writing books as novels. Therefore, we calculate the number of writing books as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of writing books} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of novels} = 2 \\times 80 = 160\n   \\]\n3. Add the number of novels and the number of writing books to find the total number of books Edith has:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of books} = \\text{Number of novels} + \\text{Number of writing books} = 80 + 160 = 240\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of novels and writing books Edith has is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of novels and writing books Edith has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of novels Edith has.\n2. Determine the number of writing books Edith has.\n3. Add the number of novels and writing books together.\n\nFirst, we know that Edith has 80 novels. According to the problem, she has half as many novels as the number of writing books she has. Let's denote the number of writing books by \\( W \\). Therefore, we can write the relationship between the number of novels and writing books as:\n\\[ 80 = \\frac{W}{2} \\]\n\nTo find \\( W \\), we need to solve the equation for \\( W \\). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ W = 80 \\times 2 = 160 \\]\n\nSo, Edith has 160 writing books. Now, we add the number of novels and writing books together to find the total number of books:\n\\[ 80 + 160 = 240 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of novels and writing books Edith has is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",
