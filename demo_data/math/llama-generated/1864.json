        "To determine Bill's new win percentage, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of games Bill has won out of the first 200 games.\n2. Determine the number of games Bill has won out of the additional 100 games.\n3. Find the total number of games Bill has played after the additional games.\n4. Calculate the total number of games Bill has won after the additional games.\n5. Compute the new win percentage.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Bill has played 200 games and won 63% of them. So, the number of games he has won out of the first 200 games is:\n\\[ 200 \\times 0.63 = 126 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of games Bill has won out of the additional 100 games. He loses 43 of them, so he wins:\n\\[ 100 - 43 = 57 \\]\n\nNow, we find the total number of games Bill has played after the additional games:\n\\[ 200 + 100 = 300 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total number of games Bill has won after the additional games:\n\\[ 126 + 57 = 183 \\]\n\nFinally, we compute the new win percentage by dividing the total number of games won by the total number of games played and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{183}{300} \\right) \\times 100 = 61\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, Bill's new win percentage is:\n\\[ \\boxed{61} \\]",

Bill has played 200 games and won 63% of them:\n\\[\n200 \\times 0.63 = 126\n\\]\nSo, Bill has won 126 games out of the first 200.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of games Bill has won in the next 100 games. Bill loses 43 of the next 100 games, so he wins:\n\\[\n100 - 43 = 57\n\\]\nSo, Bill has won 57 games out of the next 100.\n\nNow, we find the total number of games Bill has played. He has played 200 games and then played 100 more:\n\\[\n200 + 100 = 300\n\\]\nSo, Bill has played a total of 300 games.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of games Bill has won. He has won 126 games out of the first 200 and 57 games out of the next 100:\n\\[\n126 + 57 = 183\n\\]\nSo, Bill has won a total of 183 games.\n\nFinally, we compute the new win percentage. The new win percentage is the total number of games won divided by the total number of games played, multiplied by 100:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{183}{300} \\right) \\times 100 = 61\n\\]\nSo, Bill's new win percentage is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{61}\n\\]",

He has played 200 games and won 63% of them:\n\\[\n0.63 \\times 200 = 126\n\\]\nSo, Bill has won 126 games out of the 200 he has played.\n\nNext, Bill plays 100 more games and loses 43 of them. Therefore, he wins:\n\\[\n100 - 43 = 57\n\\]\nSo, Bill wins 57 out of the 100 additional games he plays.\n\nNow, we add the number of games he has won so far to the number of games he has won in the additional 100 games to find the total number of games he has won:\n\\[\n126 + 57 = 183\n\\]\nSo, Bill has won a total of 183 games.\n\nNext, we add the number of games he has played so far to the number of games he has played in the additional 100 games to find the total number of games he has played:\n\\[\n200 + 100 = 300\n\\]\nSo, Bill has played a total of 300 games.\n\nFinally, we calculate the new win percentage by dividing the total number of games he has won by the total number of games he has played and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[\n\\frac{183}{300} \\times 100 = 61\n\\]\nSo, Bill's new win percentage is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{61}\n\\]",
