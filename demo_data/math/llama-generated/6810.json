Calculate the combined probability that a candidate knows Excel and is willing to work nights.\n\nGiven:\n- 20% of the job candidates have experience with Excel.\n- 70% of the candidates are only willing to work day shifts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability that a candidate is willing to work nights. Since 70% of the candidates are only willing to work day shifts, the remaining 30% are willing to work nights. Therefore, the probability that a candidate is willing to work nights is:\n\\[ P(\\text{willing to work nights}) = 1 - P(\\text{only willing to work day shifts}) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30 \\]\n\nNext, we assume that the events \"knowing Excel\" and \"being willing to work nights\" are independent. This means that the probability of both events happening together is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\\[ P(\\text{knows Excel and willing to work nights}) = P(\\text{knows Excel}) \\times P(\\text{willing to work nights}) = 0.20 \\times 0.30 = 0.06 \\]\n\nTherefore, the odds that a randomly picked candidate knows Excel and is willing to work nights is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.06} \\]",
