The bird has put twelve twigs together already to make a circle. For each twig it placed into the circle, it wants to weave in six more twigs to fill out the nest. It knows a tree that has dropped a third of the twigs it needs. How many twigs will the bird still need to find to finish its nest?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
