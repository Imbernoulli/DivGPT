        "To determine the total number of cards Joseph had initially, we start by calculating the total number of cards he gave to his students. Joseph gave 23 cards to each of his 15 students. Therefore, we multiply the number of cards per student by the number of students:\n\n\\[ 23 \\times 15 \\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication, we can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition:\n\n\\[ 23 \\times 15 = 23 \\times (10 + 5) = (23 \\times 10) + (23 \\times 5) = 230 + 115 = 345 \\]\n\nSo, Joseph gave away 345 cards. Since he had 12 cards left after giving them away, we add the remaining cards to the number of cards he gave away to find the total number of cards he had initially:\n\n\\[ 345 + 12 = 357 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cards Joseph had at first is \\(\\boxed{357}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of cards Joseph had initially, we can break down the problem into a few simple steps.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of cards Joseph gave to his students. Joseph gave 23 cards to each of his 15 students. So, we multiply the number of cards per student by the number of students:\n\n\\[\n23 \\times 15\n\\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication, we can use the distributive property:\n\n\\[\n23 \\times 15 = 23 \\times (10 + 5) = (23 \\times 10) + (23 \\times 5) = 230 + 115 = 345\n\\]\n\nSo, Joseph gave out 345 cards to his students. Next, we know that after giving out these cards, Joseph had 12 cards left. Therefore, the total number of cards Joseph had initially is the sum of the cards he gave out and the cards he had left:\n\n\\[\n345 + 12 = 357\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of cards Joseph had at first is \\(\\boxed{357}\\).",

Add the number of cards he had left after giving cards to his students.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cards Joseph gave to his students. Joseph gave 23 cards to each of his 15 students. So, we multiply the number of cards per student by the number of students:\n\n\\[ 23 \\times 15 \\]\n\nTo make the multiplication easier, we can break it down using the distributive property:\n\n\\[ 23 \\times 15 = 23 \\times (10 + 5) = (23 \\times 10) + (23 \\times 5) = 230 + 115 = 345 \\]\n\nSo, Joseph gave away 345 cards.\n\nNext, we add the number of cards he had left after giving cards to his students. Joseph had 12 cards left. Therefore, we add 12 to the 345 cards he gave away:\n\n\\[ 345 + 12 = 357 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of cards Joseph had at first is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{357} \\]",
        "To determine how many cards Joseph had initially, we start by calculating the total number of cards he gave to his students. Joseph gave 23 cards to each of his 15 students.

        "To determine the total number of cards Joseph had initially, we start by calculating the number of cards he gave to his students. Joseph gave 23 cards to each of his 15 students, so the total number of cards given away is:\n\n\\[ 23 \\times 15 \\]\n\nTo find the product of 23 and 15, we can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

Joseph had 12 cards left, so we add 12 to 345:\n\\[ 345 + 12 = 357 \\]\n\nTherefore, the initial number of cards Joseph had is \\(\\boxed{357}\\).",

Joseph gave 23 cards to each of his 15 students. Therefore, the total number of cards given away is:\n\\[ 23 \\times 15 \\]\n\nTo find the product of 23 and 15, we can use the distributive property:\n\\[ 23 \\times 15 = 23 \\times (10 + 5) = (23 \\times 10) + (23 \\times 5) = 230 + 115 = 345 \\]\n\nSo, Joseph gave away 345 cards.\n\nNext, we add the number of cards he had left to the total number of cards he gave away.

        "To determine how many cards Joseph had at first, we need to consider the total number of cards he distributed to his students and the number of cards he had left. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Joseph gave 23 cards to each of his 15 students. So, we calculate the total number of cards distributed by multiplying the number of cards each student received by the number of students:\n   \\[\n   23 \\times 15\n   \\]\n   To perform the multiplication, we can break it down:\n   \\[\n   23 \\times 15 = 23 \\times (10 + 5) = (23 \\times 10) + (23 \\times 5) = 230 + 115 = 345\n   \\]\n   So, Joseph distributed 345 cards to his students.\n\n2. Joseph had 12 cards left after distributing the cards. Therefore, the total number of cards he had at first is the sum of the cards distributed and the cards left:\n   \\[\n   345 + 12 = 357\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cards Joseph had at first is \\(\\boxed{357}\\).",
