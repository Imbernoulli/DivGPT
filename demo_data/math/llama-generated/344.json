        "To determine how much food Lily's puppy will eat over the next 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the total amount of food consumed in each period.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of food the puppy will eat in the first two weeks:\n- The puppy is fed \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) cup of food three times a day.\n- Therefore, the daily amount of food is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ cup/meal} \\times 3 \\text{ meals/day} = \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ cup/day}\n  \\]\n- Over two weeks (14 days), the total amount of food is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ cup/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = \\frac{3 \\times 14}{4} \\text{ cups} = \\frac{42}{4} \\text{ cups} = 10.5 \\text{ cups}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of food the puppy will eat in the following two weeks:\n- The puppy is fed \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) cup of food two times a day.\n- Therefore, the daily amount of food is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ cup/meal} \\times 2 \\text{ meals/day} = 1 \\text{ cup/day}\n  \\]\n- Over two weeks (14 days), the total amount of food is:\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ cup/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 14 \\text{ cups}\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's add up the amount of food the puppy has already eaten today:\n- The puppy has been fed \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) cup of food today.\n\nFinally, we sum up all the amounts of food consumed over the next 4 weeks:\n\\[\n10.5 \\text{ cups} + 14 \\text{ cups} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ cup}\n\\]\n\nTo add these amounts, we convert \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) cup to a decimal:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ cup} = 0.5 \\text{ cup}\n\\]\n\nNow, add all the amounts together:\n\\[\n10.5 \\text{ cups} + 14 \\text{ cups} + 0.5 \\text{ cup} = 25 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of food the puppy will eat over the next 4 weeks, including today, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{25}\n\\]",
