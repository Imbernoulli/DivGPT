        "To determine how many minutes Annie spent building the diorama, we start by defining variables for the time spent planning and building it. Let \\( p \\) represent the number of minutes Annie spent planning the diorama. According to the problem, the time spent building the diorama is three times the time spent planning it minus 5 minutes. Therefore, we can express the time spent building the diorama as \\( 3p - 5 \\).\n\nThe total time spent on the diorama is the sum of the time spent planning and the time spent building it. We know this total is 67 minutes. Thus, we can write the equation:\n\\[\np + (3p - 5) = 67\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n4p - 5 = 67\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( p \\), we add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n4p = 72\n\\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 4:\n\\[\np = 18\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Annie spent 18 minutes planning the diorama, we can find out how many minutes she spent building it by substituting \\( p = 18 \\) back into the expression for the time spent building:\n\\[\n3p - 5 = 3(18) - 5 = 54 - 5 = 49\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of minutes Annie spent building the diorama is \\(\\boxed{49}\\).",
