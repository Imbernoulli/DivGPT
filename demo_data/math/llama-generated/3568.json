The high-tech shoes will help Candace walk twice as fast, but they're not broken in yet, so she'll get 1 blister after every 2 hours she spends walking in them. Each blister slows Candance down by 2 miles per hour. If Candance walks 6 miles per hour in the old shoes and plans to hike for 4 hours, how many miles per hour can she go in the new shoes?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many miles per hour Candace can go in the new high-tech shoes, we need to consider both the increase in speed and the decrease in speed due to blisters.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the speed Candace will have after walking in the new shoes for 2 hours. Since the high-tech shoes help her walk twice as fast, her initial speed in the new shoes is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 2 = 12 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nAfter 2 hours of walking, she will get 1 blister, which slows her down by 2 miles per hour. So, her speed after the blister is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ miles per hour} - 2 \\text{ miles per hour} = 10 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the speed Candace will have after walking in the new shoes for the remaining 2 hours. Since she has already been walking for 2 hours and plan to hike for a total of 4 hours, she will have another 2 hours to walk. During these 2 hours, she will not get another blister because she only gets 1 blister after every 2 hours. Therefore, her speed for the remaining 2 hours is still:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nTo find her average speed over the entire 4-hour hike, we calculate the total distance she covers and divide it by the total time. The distance she covers in the first 2 hours is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 24 \\text{ miles} \\]\nThe distance she covers in the next 2 hours is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ miles per hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 20 \\text{ miles} \\]\nSo, the total distance she covers is:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ miles} + 20 \\text{ miles} = 44 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThe average speed over the 4-hour hike is:\n\\[ \\frac{44 \\text{ miles}}{4 \\text{ hours}} = 11 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of miles per hour Candace can go in the new shoes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]"
