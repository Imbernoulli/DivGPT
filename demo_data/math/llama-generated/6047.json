        "To determine the number of pink and purple flowers in the garden, we start by identifying the quantities of each color of flower given in the problem.\n\n1. **Orange Flowers:**\n   We are given that there are 10 orange flowers.\n\n2. **Red Flowers:**\n   There are twice as many red flowers as orange flowers. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red flowers} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of orange flowers} = 2 \\times 10 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Yellow Flowers:**\n   There are five fewer yellow flowers than red flowers. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of yellow flowers} = \\text{Number of red flowers} - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Number of_egrees:**\n   The garden has a total of 105 flowers. We sum the number of red, orange, and yellow flowers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of red, orange, and yellow flowers} = 20 + 10 + 15 = 45\n   \\]\n\n5. **Number of Pink and Purple Flowers:**\n   The remaining flowers in the garden are pink and purple. Since there are no other colors and the number of pink and purple flowers is the same, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of pink and purple flowers} = \\text{Total number of flowers} - \\text{Total number of red, orange, and yellow flowers} = 105 - 45 = 60\n   \\]\n\n6. **Number of Pink Flowers:**\n   Since the number of pink flowers is the same as the number of purple flowers, we divide the total number of pink and purple flowers by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pink flowers} = \\text{Number of purple flowers} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pink and purple flowers is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

The remaining flowers are pink and purple, and they have the same amount.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of pink and purple flowers} = 105 - \\text{Total number of red, orange, and yellow flowers} = 105 - 45 = 60\n   \\]\n   Since the number of pink and purple flowers is the same:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of pink flowers} = \\text{Number of purple flowers} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of pink and purple flowers}}{2} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pink and purple flowers is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

        "Let's start by determining the number of red flowers. According to the problem, there are twice as many red flowers as orange flowers. Since there are 10 orange flowers, we can calculate the number of red flowers as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red flowers} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of orange flowers} = 2 \\times 10 = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many yellow flowers there are. The problem states that there are five fewer yellow flowers than red flowers. Since there are 20 red flowers, we can calculate the number of yellow flowers as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of yellow flowers} = \\text{Number of red flowers} - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15\n\\]\n\nNow, we know the number of red, orange, and yellow flowers. We can add these together to find out how many flowers have already been accounted for:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of red, orange, and yellow flowers} = 20 + 10 + 15 = 45\n\\]\n\nSince the garden has a total of 105 flowers, the number of pink and purple flowers combined is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of pink and purple flowers} = 105 - \\text{Total number of red, orange, and yellow flowers} = 105 - 45 = 60\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that there are the same number of pink flowers and purple flowers. Therefore, we can find the number of pink flowers (and also the number of purple flowers) by dividing the total number of pink and purple flowers by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pink flowers} = \\text{Number of purple flowers} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of pink and purple flowers is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
        "To determine the number of pink and purple flowers in the garden, we start by identifying the quantities of each color of flower given the relationships between them.\n\nFirst, we know there are 10 orange flowers.

Therefore, the number of red flowers is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we know there are five fewer yellow flowers than red flowers.
