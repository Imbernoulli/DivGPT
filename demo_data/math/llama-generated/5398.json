She collects 3 caps per month in the first year, and 5 caps per month after the first year. Each Christmas, she also receives 40 caps from friends and family. She estimates that each year, she loses 15 of the caps she has collected. If Lilith has been collecting for 5 years, how many caps has she collected so far?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
