        "To determine how many pints of ice cream Alice had on Wednesday, we need to calculate the amount of ice cream she bought each day and then account for the returns.\n\n1. **Sunday**: Alice bought 4 pints of strawberry ice cream.\n2. **Monday**: Alice bought three times the number of pints she bought on Sunday.
