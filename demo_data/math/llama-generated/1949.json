Add the initial amount raised by the class to the total amount contributed by the students to get the total amount of money available.\n   The class initially raised $50.\n   \\[\n   50 + 100 = 150\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount of money available is $150.\n\n3. Calculate the total cost of the field trip.\n   The cost of the trip is $7 for each student, and there are 20 students.\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 20 = 140\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the field trip is $140.\n\n4. Subtract the total cost of the field trip from the total amount of money available to find out how much is left.\n   \\[\n   150 - 140 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, the amount of money left in Miss Grayson's class fund is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
