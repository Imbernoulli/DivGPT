So, the cost of the eggs is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ eggs} \\times £3 \\text{ per egg} = £6\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the total cost of Dale's breakfast is:\n  \\[\n  £2 + £6 = £8\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of Andrew's breakfast:\n- Andrew had 1 slice of toast, and each slice costs £1. So, the cost of the toast is:\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ slice} \\times £1 \\text{ per slice} = £1\n  \\]\n- Andrew also had 2 eggs, and each egg costs £3. So, the cost of the eggs is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ eggs} \\times £3 \\text{ per egg} = £6\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the total cost of Andrew's breakfast is:\n  \\[\n  £1 + £6 = £7\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we add the costs of Dale's and Andrew's breakfasts to find the total cost of their meal:\n\\[\n£8 + £7 = £15\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost of their breakfast is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",

So, the cost of the toast is \\(2 \\times 1 = £2\\).\n- Dale had 2 eggs, and each egg costs £3.
