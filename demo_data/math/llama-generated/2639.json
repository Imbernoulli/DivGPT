        "To determine how many toads Sarah has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many toads Jim has.\n2. Use the number of toads Jim has to find out how many toads Sarah has.\n\nFirst, we know that Tim has 30 toads. Jim has 20 more toads than Tim does. Therefore, we can calculate the number of toads Jim has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of toads Jim has} = \\text{Number of toads Tim has} + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Sarah has twice as many toads as Jim does. Therefore, we can calculate the number of toads Sarah has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of toads Sarah has} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of toads Jim has} = 2 \\times 50 = 100\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of toads Sarah has is \\boxed{100}.",
