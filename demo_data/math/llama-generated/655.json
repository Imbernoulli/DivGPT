        "To find the total population of Boise, Seattle, and Lake View, we need to determine the population of each city step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the population of Seattle as \\( S \\).\n\nWe know that Lake View's population is 24000 and it is 4000 more than the population of Seattle. Therefore, we can write the equation for the population of Lake View as:\n\\[ S + 4000 = 24000 \\]\n\nTo find \\( S \\), we subtract 4000 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ S = 24000 - 4000 \\]\n\\[ S = 20000 \\]\n\nSo, the population of Seattle is 20000.\n\nNext, we know that Boise has \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) times as many people as Seattle.
