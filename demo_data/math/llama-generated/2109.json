        "To determine how many employees use public transportation to get to work, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of employees who drive to work:**\n   - The company has 100 employees.\n   - 60% of the employees drive to work.\n   \\[\n   0.60 \\times 100 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, 60 employees drive to work.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of employees who don't drive to work:**\n   - Total number of employees = 100\n   - Number of employees who drive to work = 60\n   \\[\n   100 - 60 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, 40 employees don't drive to work.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of employees who take public transportation:**\n   - Of the employees who don't drive to work, half take public transportation.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, 20 employees use public transportation to get to work.\n\nTherefore, the number of employees who use public transportation to get to work is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
        "To determine how many employees use public transportation to get to work, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of employees who drive to work.\n2. Determine the number of employees who do not drive to work.\n3. Find out how many of the employees who do not drive to work take public transportation.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of employees who drive to work. Since 60% of the employees drive to work, we have:\n\\[\n0.60 \\times 100 = 60\n\\]\nSo, 60 employees drive to work.\n\nNext, we determine the number of employees who do not drive to work. Since there are 100 employees in total and 60 drive to work, the number of employees who do not drive to work is:\n\\[\n100 - 60 = 40\n\\]\nSo, 40 employees do not drive to work.\n\nOf the employees who do not drive to work, half take public transportation. Therefore, the number of employees who take public transportation is:\n\\[\n\\frac{40}{2} = 20\n\\]\nSo, 20 employees use public transportation to get to work.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",
