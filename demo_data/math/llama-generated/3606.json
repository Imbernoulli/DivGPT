Determine how many cakes Clifford eats over the 6 days.\n3. Subtract the number of cakes Clifford eats from the total number of cakes baked.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cakes Julia bakes. Julia bakes one less than 5 cakes per day, which means she bakes \\(5 - 1 = 4\\) cakes each day. Over 6 days, the total number of cakes baked is:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ cakes/day} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 24 \\text{ cakes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many cakes Clifford eats. Clifford eats one cake every other day. Over 6 days, there are 3 days when Clifford eats a cake (specifically, on days 2, 4, and 6). Therefore, the total number of cakes Clifford eats is:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ cake/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 3 \\text{ cakes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of cakes Clifford eats from the total number of cakes baked to find out how many cakes Julia has remaining:\n\\[\n24 \\text{ cakes} - 3 \\text{ cakes} = 21 \\text{ cakes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of cakes Julia has remaining at the end of 6 days is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",

Subtract the number of cakes Clifford eats from the total number of cakes baked.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cakes Julia bakes.**\n\nJulia bakes one less than 5 cakes per day. Therefore, she bakes:\n\\[ 5 - 1 = 4 \\text{ cakes per day} \\]\n\nOver 6 days, the total number of cakes baked is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ cakes/day} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 24 \\text{ cakes} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many cakes Clifford eats.**\n\nClifford eats one cake every other day. Over 6 days, there are:\n\\[ \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ days} \\]\non which Clifford eats a cake. Therefore, the total number of cakes Clifford eats is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ cake/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 3 \\text{ cakes} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of cakes Clifford eats from the total number of cakes baked.**\n\nThe number of cakes Julia has remaining is:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ cakes} - 3 \\text{ cakes} = 21 \\text{ cakes} \\]\n\nThus, the number of cakes Julia has remaining at the end of 6 days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]",
        "To determine how many cakes Julia has remaining at the end of 6 days, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of cakes Julia bakes over the 6 days. Julia bakes one less than 5 cakes each day, which means she bakes 4 cakes per day. Over 6 days, the total number of cakes baked is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ cakes/day} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 24 \\text{ cakes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the cakes that Clifford eats. Clifford eats one cake every other day. Over 6 days, Clifford will eat cakes on days 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, the total number of cakes Clifford eats is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ cake/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 3 \\text{ cakes} \\]\n\nTo find out how many cakes Julia has remaining, we subtract the number of cakes Clifford eats from the total number of cakes baked:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ cakes} - 3 \\text{ cakes} = 21 \\text{ cakes} \\]\n\nThus, the number of cakes Julia has remaining at the end of 6 days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]",
