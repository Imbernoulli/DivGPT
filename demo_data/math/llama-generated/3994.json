Determine how many people can taste the apple pie based on the total number of bite-size samples.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of halves Sedrach can get from the 13 apple pies. Since each apple pie can be divided into 2 halves, we multiply the number of apple pies by 2:\n\\[ 13 \\times 2 = 26 \\text{ halves} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of bite-size samples from the 26 halves. Since each half can be split into 5 bite-size samples, we multiply the number of halves by 5:\n\\[ 26 \\times 5 = 130 \\text{ bite-size samples} \\]\n\nSince each bite-size sample can be tasted by one person, the total number of people who can taste Sedrach's apple pie is:\n\\[ 130 \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{130} \\]",
