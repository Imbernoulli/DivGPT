        "To determine how much Cole has to pay for the fence, we need to calculate the total length of the fence he is installing and then account for the contributions from his neighbors.\n\nFirst, calculate the total length of the fence:\n- The backyard is 9 feet along the sides and 18 feet along the back.\n- Since Cole is fencing three sides (two sides and the back), the total length of the fence is:\n  \\[\n  9 + 9 + 18 = 36 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\nNext, determine the contributions from the neighbors:\n- The neighbor behind him agreed to pay for half of their shared side, which is 18 feet. Therefore, the neighbor behind him pays:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\times 18 = 9 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n- The neighbor on his left agreed to pay for a third of their shared side, which is 9 feet. Therefore, the neighbor on his left pays:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{3} \\times 9 = 3 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\nCalculate the total length of the fence that Cole's neighbors pay for:\n\\[\n9 + 3 = 12 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nSubtract the length paid by the neighbors from the total length of the fence to find out how much Cole has to pay:\n\\[\n36 - 12 = 24 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nFinally, calculate the cost of the fence that Cole has to pay. Since fencing costs $3 per foot, the cost is:\n\\[\n24 \\times 3 = 72 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount Cole has to pay for the fence is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{72}\n\\]"
