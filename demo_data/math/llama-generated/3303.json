        "To determine how much the restaurant donates, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount donated by the customers.\n2. Determine the restaurant's donation based on the total customer donations.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount donated by the customers.**\n\nThe average donation per customer is $3, and there are 40 customers. Therefore, the total amount donated by the customers is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ dollars/customer} \\times 40 \\text{ customers} = 120 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the restaurant's donation based on the total customer donations.**\n\nThe restaurant donates $2 for every $10 donated by customers. To find out how much the restaurant donates, we divide the total customer donations by 10 and then multiply by 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{120 \\text{ dollars}}{10 \\text{ dollars}} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars} = 12 \\times 2 = 24 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the restaurant donates \\(\\boxed{24}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine how much the restaurant donates, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount donated by the customers.\n2. Determine how much the restaurant donates based on the customers' donations.\n\nFirst, let's find the total amount donated by the customers. The average donation per customer is $3 and there are 40 customers. Therefore, the total amount donated by the customers is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 40 = 120 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much the restaurant donates. The restaurant donates $2 for every $10 donated by the customers. To find out how many $10 increments are in $120, we divide $120 by $10:\n\\[\n120 \\div 10 = 12\n\\]\nSince the restaurant donates $2 for each $10 increment, the total donation by the restaurant is:\n\\[\n12 \\times 2 = 24 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount donated by the restaurant is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]",
