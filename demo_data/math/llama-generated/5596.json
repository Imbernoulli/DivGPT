        "To determine how many bags of apples Pam has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of apples in each of Pam's bags.\n2. Determine how many bags Pam has based on the total number of apples she has.\n\nFirst, we know that each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags. Since each of Gerald's bags has 40 apples, we can calculate the number of apples in each of Pam's bags as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\times 40 = 120\n\\]\nSo, each of Pam's bags has 120 apples.\n\nNext, we know that Pam has a total of 1200 apples. To find out how many bags Pam has, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each bag:\n\\[\n1200 \\div 120 = 10\n\\]\nTherefore, Pam has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) bags of apples.",

Use the total number of apples Pam has to find out how many bags she has.\n\nFirst, we know that each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags. Since each of Gerald's bags has 40 apples, we can calculate the number of apples in each of Pam's bags as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\times 40 = 120\n\\]\nSo, each of Pam's bags has 120 apples.\n\nNext, we know that Pam has a total of 1200 apples. To find out how many bags Pam has, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each bag:\n\\[\n1200 \\div 120 = 10\n\\]\nSo, Pam has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) bags of apples.",
        "To determine how many bags of apples Pam has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of apples in each of Pam's bags.\n2. Determine the total number of apples Pam has in terms of the number of bags she has.\n3. Solve for the number of bags Pam has.\n\nFirst, we know that each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags. Since each of Gerald's bags has 40 apples, we can calculate the number of apples in each of Pam's bags as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\times 40 = 120\n\\]\nSo, each of Pam's bags has 120 apples.\n\nNext, let's denote the number of bags Pam has by \\( x \\). Since each of Pam's bags has 120 apples, the total number of apples Pam has is:\n\\[\n120x\n\\]\nWe know from the problem statement that Pam has 1200 apples in total. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n120x = 1200\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 120:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1200}{120} = 10\n\\]\nSo, Pam has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) bags of apples.",
