The train's capacity is 120 people. Therefore, we can calculate the capacity of one bus as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Capacity of one bus} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 120 = 20 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\nSince there are two buses, we can find the combined capacity of the two buses by multiplying the capacity of one bus by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Combined capacity of the two buses} = 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\nThus, the combined capacity of the two buses is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
        "To determine the combined capacity of the two buses, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the capacity of one bus:**\n   - We know that each bus has a capacity of \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of the train's capacity.\n   - The train's capacity is 120 people.\n   - Therefore, the capacity of one bus is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Capacity of one bus} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 120 = 20 \\text{ people}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the combined capacity of the two buses:**\n   - Since there are two buses, we multiply the capacity of one bus by 2:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Combined capacity of two buses} = 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ people}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the combined capacity of the two buses is \\(\\boxed{40}\\)."
