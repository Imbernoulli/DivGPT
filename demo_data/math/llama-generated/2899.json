        "To determine how much Erwan spent after all the discounts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discounted price of the shoes.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the shirts.\n3. Add the discounted price of the shoes and the total cost of the shirts.\n4. Apply the additional 5% discount to the sum from step 3.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the shoes.**\n\nThe original price of the shoes is $200, and there is a 30% discount. First, we find the amount of the discount:\n\\[ 200 \\times 0.30 = 60 \\]\nSo, the discounted price of the shoes is:\n\\[ 200 - 60 = 140 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the shirts.**\n\nErwan bought two shirts, each costing $80. Therefore, the total cost of the shirts is:\n\\[ 80 \\times 2 = 160 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the discounted price of the shoes and the total cost of the shirts.**\n\nThe total cost before the additional discount is:\n\\[ 140 + 160 = 300 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Apply the additional 5% discount to the sum from step 3.**\n\nThe additional discount is 5%. First, we find the amount of this discount:\n\\[ 300 \\times 0.05 = 15 \\]\nSo, the final amount Erwan spent after all the discounts is:\n\\[ 300 - 15 = 285 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Erwan spent after all the discounts is:\n\\[ \\boxed{285} \\]",

Apply the additional 5% discount to the subtotal.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the shoes after the 30% discount.**\n\nThe original price of the shoes is $200. The discount is 30%, so we need to find 30% of $200 and subtract it from the original price.\n\\[ 30\\% \\text{ of } 200 = 0.30 \\times 200 = 60 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Discounted price of the shoes} = 200 - 60 = 140 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the two shirts.**\n\nEach shirt costs $80, and Erwan bought two shirts.\n\\[ \\text{Total cost of the shirts} = 2 \\times 80 = 160 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the discounted cost of the shoes to the total cost of the shirts to get the subtotal.**\n\n\\[ \\text{Subtotal} = 140 + 160 = 300 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Apply the additional 5% discount to the subtotal.**\n\nThe additional discount is 5%, so we need to find 5% of $300 and subtract it from the subtotal.\n\\[ 5\\% \\text{ of } 300 = 0.05 \\times 300 = 15 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Final amount spent} = 300 - 15 = 285 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Erwan spent after all the discounts is \\(\\boxed{285}\\).",
        "First, let's calculate the price of the shoes after the 30% discount. The original price of the shoes is $200. A 30% discount means Erwan pays 70% of the original price. So, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 200 \\times (1 - 0.30) = 200 \\times 0.70 = 140 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the two shirts. Each shirt costs $80, so for two shirts, the total cost is:\n\n\\[ 80 \\times 2 = 160 \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the shoes and the cost of the shirts to get the total cost before the additional 5% discount:\n\n\\[ 140 + 160 = 300 \\]\n\nThe cashier then applying an additional 5% discount to the total cost of $300. A 5% discount means Erwan pays 95% of the total cost. So, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 300 \\times (1 - 0.05) = 300 \\times 0.95 = 285 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Erwan spent after all the discounts is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{285} \\]",

First, we find out how much the discount is:\n\\[ 200 \\times 0.30 = 60 \\]\nSo, the discounted price of the shoes is:\n\\[ 200 - 60 = 140 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the shirts.**\n\nEach shirt costs $80, and Erwan bought two shirts. So, the total cost of the shirts is:\n\\[ 80 \\times 2 = 160 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the discounted price of the shoes and the total cost of the shirts to get the subtotal.**\n\nThe subtotal is:\n\\[ 140 + 160 = 300 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Apply the additional 5% discount to the subtotal.**\n\nThe additional discount is 5%. First, we find out how much the discount is:\n\\[ 300 \\times 0.05 = 15 \\]\nSo, the final amount Erwan spends after all the discounts is:\n\\[ 300 - 15 = 285 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Erwan spent after all the discounts is \\(\\boxed{285}\\).",

Apply the additional 5% discount to the subtotal.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the shoes after the 30% discount.**\n\nThe original price of the shoes is $200. A 30% discount means the shoes are sold for 70% of the original price.\n\\[ 200 \\times (1 - 0.30) = 200 \\times 0.70 = 140 \\]\nSo, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $140.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the two shirts.**\n\nEach shirt costs $80, and Erwan bought two shirts.\n\\[ 80 \\times 2 = 160 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the two shirts is $160.\n\n**Step 3: Add the discounted cost of the shoes and the total cost of the shirts to get the subtotal.**\n\nThe subtotal is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the total cost of the shirts.\n\\[ 140 + 160 = 300 \\]\nSo, the subtotal is $300.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the additional 5% discount to the subtotal.**\n\nA 5% discount means the total amount paid is 95% of the subtotal.\n\\[ 300 \\times (1 - 0.05) = 300 \\times 0.95 = 285 \\]\nSo, the total amount Erwan spent after all the discounts is $285.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{285}\n\\]",
