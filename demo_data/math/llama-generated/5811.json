        "To determine how many sheets of paper Fred has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of sheets Fred had, which is 212.\n2. Add the number of sheets Jane gave Fred, which is 307.\n3. Subtract the number of sheets Fred gave to Charles, which is 156.\n\nLet's perform the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Initial number of sheets Fred had: 212.\n2. Sheets received from Jane: 212 + 307 = 519.\n3. Sheets given to Charles: 519 - 156 = 363.\n\nSo, the number of sheets of paper Fred has left is \\boxed{363}.",
