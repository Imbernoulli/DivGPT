First, he wants to make a To Do list and count up how many things he has to do that day and how long it should take. He has several items under 'clean the house,' 'take a shower' and then 'make dinner.' In total there are 7 things to do to clean the house; 1 thing to do to take a shower; and 4 things to do to make dinner. If everything on Trey's list takes 10 minutes to do, how many hours total will it take to complete Trey's list?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

To convert 120 minutes to hours, we divide by 60:\n\\[ 120 \\div 60 = 2 \\]\nSo, it will take 2 hours to complete Trey's list.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total time Trey will spend completing his list, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tasks on the list.\n2. Determine the total time required to complete all the tasks.\n3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tasks:\n- There are 7 tasks to clean the house.\n- There is 1 task to take a shower.\n- There are 4 tasks to make dinner.\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[ 7 + 1 + 4 = 12 \\text{ tasks} \\]\n\nNext, we know that each task takes 10 minutes to complete. Therefore, the total time required to complete all the tasks is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ tasks} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes/task} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nFinally, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total time it will take Trey to complete his list is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) hours.",
