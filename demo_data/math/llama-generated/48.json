        "To determine the total cost of the cab rides for Briar over the one-week community empowerment event, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of a single round trip.\n2. Determine the number of round trips Briar will take in one week.\n3. Multiply the cost of one round trip by the number of round trips.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of a single round trip. The event is 200 miles away from Briar's home, so the one-way trip is 200 miles. Therefore, the round trip (to the event and back home) is:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 400 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Briar will take a cab ride to the event and back home every day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of round trips is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total cost of the cab rides for the week. The cost of one round trip is:\n\\[ 400 \\text{ miles} \\times \\$2.5 \\text{ per mile} = \\$1000 \\]\n\nSince Briar takes 7 round trips, the total cost for the week is:\n\\[ 7 \\times \\$1000 = \\$7000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money the cab rides cost would be at the end of the event is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7000} \\]",
