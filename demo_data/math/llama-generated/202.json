Determine how many yellow balls Jamie bought to reach a total of 74 balls.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Jamie had 16 red balls and two times more blue balls. Therefore, the number of blue balls is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 16 = 32\n   \\]\n\n2. Jamie lost 6 red balls, so the number of red balls he has now is:\n   \\[\n   16 - 6 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. The total number of balls Jamie has after losing some red balls is the sum of the remaining red balls, the blue balls, and the yellow balls he has not yet bought. Let's denote the number of yellow balls he bought as \\( y \\). According to the problem, after buying the yellow balls, he had 74 balls in total.

Find out how many yellow balls Jamie bought to reach the final total.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many blue balls Jamie had initially. Jamie had two times more blue balls than red balls.

Jamie had 16 red balls and two times more blue balls. Therefore, the number of blue balls is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 16 = 32\n   \\]\n\n2. Jamie lost 6 red balls, so the number of red balls he had left is:\n   \\[\n   16 - 6 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. The total number of red and blue balls Jamie had after losing some red balls is:\n   \\[\n   10 + 32 = 42\n   \\]\n\n4. Jamie最终 had 74 balls in total. Therefore, the number of yellow balls he bought is:\n   \\[\n   74 - 42 = 32\n   \\]\n\nSo, the number of yellow balls Jamie bought is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
        "To determine how many yellow balls Jamie bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial number of blue balls.\n2. Determine the number of red balls after losing some.\n3. Calculate the total number of balls before buying any yellow balls.\n4. Determine the number of yellow balls bought by finding the difference between the total number of balls after buying the yellow balls and the total number of balls before buying them.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial number of blue balls. Jamie had two times more blue balls than red balls. Since he had 16 red balls, the number of blue balls is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\]\n\nNext, Jamie lost 6 red balls.

Determine how many yellow balls Jamie bought to reach a total of 74 balls.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of blue balls Jamie initially had. Jamie had two times more blue balls than red balls. Since he had 16 red balls, the number of blue balls is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of red balls Jamie had after losing 6 of them. Initially, he had 16 red balls, so after losing 6, he had:\n\\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of red and blue balls after the loss. Jamie has 10 red balls and 32 blue balls, so the total number of red and blue balls is:\n\\[ 10 + 32 = 42 \\]\n\nJamie decided to buy some yellow balls to fill up his collection, and after all, he had 74 balls in total. Therefore, the number of yellow balls he bought is:\n\\[ 74 - 42 = 32 \\]\n\nSo, the number of yellow balls Jamie bought is:\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]",

Therefore, the number of blue balls is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of red balls Jamie had after losing some.**\n\nJamie lost 6 red balls, so the number of red balls he had left is:\n\\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of balls Jamie had before buying the yellow balls.**\n\nThe total number of balls before buying the yellow balls is the sum of the red balls left, the blue balls, and the yellow balls he bought. However, since we don't know the number of yellow balls yet, we can express this total as:\n\\[ 10 + 32 + y \\]\nwhere \\( y \\) is the number of yellow balls bought.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of yellow balls Jamie bought.**\n\nWe know that after buying the yellow balls, Jamie had 74 balls in total. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 10 + 32 + y = 74 \\]\n\nSimplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 42 + y = 74 \\]\n\nTo find \\( y \\), subtract 42 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ y = 74 - 42 \\]\n\\[ y = 32 \\]\n\nSo, the number of yellow balls Jamie bought is:\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]",
