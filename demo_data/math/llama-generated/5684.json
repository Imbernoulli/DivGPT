        "To determine how many miles Jim travels, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the distance Jill travels.\n2. Determine the distance Jim travels based on Jill's distance.\n\nFirst, we find out how far Jill travels. Since Jill travels 5 miles less than John, we subtract 5 miles from the distance John travels:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance Jill travels} = 15 \\text{ miles} - 5 \\text{ miles} = 10 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the distance Jim travels. Since Jim travels only 20% as far as Jill, we multiply Jill's distance by 20% (or 0.20):\n\\[\n\\text{Distance Jim travels} = 10 \\text{ miles} \\times 0.20 = 2 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of miles Jim travels is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
        "To determine how many miles Jim travels, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the distance Jill travels.\n2. Determine the distance Jim travels based on the percentage of Jill's distance.\n\nFirst, we find out how many miles Jill travels. Since Jill travels 5 miles less than John, we subtract 5 from John's distance:\n\\[\n\\text{Jill's distance} = 15 - 5 = 10 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many miles Jim travels. Jim travels 20% as far as Jill. To find 20% of Jill's distance, we multiply Jill's distance by 0.20:\n\\[\n\\text{Jim's distance} = 10 \\times 0.20 = 2 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of miles Jim travels is \\boxed{2}.",
