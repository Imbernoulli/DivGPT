        "To determine how much time Joan has left to use the finger exerciser, we need to first calculate the total time she has already spent on her other activities. Joan spends 30 minutes on the piano, 25 minutes writing music on her computer, and 38 minutes reading about the history of the piano. We can find the total time spent on these activities by adding these times together:\n\n\\[ 30 + 25 + 38 = 93 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nJoan has 2 hours to get all her music practice done. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2 hours is equivalent to:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total time spent on the other activities from the total time available to find out how much time Joan has left to use the finger exerciser:\n\n\\[ 120 - 93 = 27 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, Joan has \\(\\boxed{27}\\) minutes left to use the finger exerciser.",
