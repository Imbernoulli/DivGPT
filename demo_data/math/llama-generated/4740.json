        "To determine the total amount spent by Kristine and Crystal, we need to calculate the cost of each girl's purchase separately and then sum the two amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of Kristine's purchase:\n- Kristine buys one set of barrettes and one comb.\n- The cost of one set of barrettes is $3.\n- The cost of one comb is $1.\n- Therefore, the total cost for Kristine is:\n  \\[\n  3 + 1 = 4\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of Crystal's purchase:\n- Crystal buys three sets of barrettes and one comb.\n- The cost of one set of barrettes is $3.\n- The cost of one comb is $1.\n- Therefore, the total cost for Crystal is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 3 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the total costs of both girls:\n- Kristine spends $4.\n- Crystal spends $10.\n- Therefore, the total amount spent by both girls is:\n  \\[\n  4 + 10 = 14\n  \\]\n\nThus, the total amount spent by Kristine and Crystal altogether is \\boxed{14}.",
