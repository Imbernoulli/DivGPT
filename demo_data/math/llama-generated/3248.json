        "To determine how many pieces of junk mail each house will get, we start by dividing the total number of pieces of junk mail by the total number of houses. The mailman has 48 pieces of junk mail to deliver to 8 houses. Therefore, we perform the following division:\n\n\\[ 48 \\div 8 = 6 \\]\n\nThis means that each house will receive 6 pieces of junk mail, regardless of the color of their mailboxes. The color of the mailboxes (white or red) does not affect the distribution of the junk mail.\n\nThus, the number of pieces of junk mail each house will get is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
        "To determine how many pieces of junk mail each house will get, we start by noting that the mailman has to deliver a total of 48 pieces of junk mail to 8 houses. We can find out how many pieces each house gets by dividing the total number of pieces of junk mail by the total number of houses.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Pieces of junk mail per house} = \\frac{48 \\text{ pieces}}{8 \\text{ houses}} = 6 \\text{ pieces per house}\n\\]\n\nSince the color of the mailboxes does not affect the distribution of the junk mail, each house will get 6 pieces of junk mail regardless of the color of their mailbox. Therefore, both the houses with white mailboxes and the houses with red mailboxes will each get 6 pieces of junk mail.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many pieces of junk mail each house will get, we start by finding out how many pieces of junk mail each house will receive if the mail is distributed equally among all the houses.\n\nThe total number of pieces of junk mail is 48, and there are 8 houses on the block. So, we divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the total number of houses:\n\\[\n\\frac{48}{8} = 6\n\\]\nThis means each house will get 6 pieces of junk mail.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many pieces of junk mail each house with a white mailbox will get and how many pieces of junk mail each house with a red mailbox will get. Since each house gets 6 pieces of junk mail, each house with a white mailbox will get 6 pieces, and each house with a red mailbox will get 6 pieces.\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of junk mail each house with a white mailbox will get is \\boxed{6}, and the number of pieces of junk mail each house with a red mailbox will get is \\boxed{6}.",

Therefore, each house, regardless of mailbox color, will receive the same number of pieces of junk mail.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Each house, including those with white and red mailboxes, will receive \\(\\boxed{6}\\) pieces of junk mail.",
        "To determine how many pieces of junk mail each house will get, we start by noting that the mailman has to deliver 48 pieces of junk mail to 8 houses.

        "To determine how many pieces of junk mail each house will get, we start by finding the total number of houses on the block. According to the problem, there are 8 houses in total.\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the total number of houses to find out how many pieces each house will receive. The total number of pieces of junk mail is 48.\n\nSo, we perform the division:\n\\[ \\frac{48}{8} = 6 \\]\n\nThis means that each house will receive 6 pieces of junk mail. Since the color of the mailboxes does not affect the distribution of the junk mail, each house, regardless of the color of its mailbox, will get 6 pieces of junk mail.\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of junk mail each house will get is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",

        "To determine how many pieces of junk mail each house will get, we need to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the total number of houses.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of houses on the block. According to the problem, there are 8 houses.\n\nNext, we need to distribute the 48 pieces of junk mail equally among these 8 houses. We do this by performing the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{48}{8} = 6 \\]\n\nSo, each house will get 6 pieces of junk mail.\n\nNow, let's consider the houses with white mailboxes and red mailboxes. There are 2 houses with white mailboxes and 3 houses with red mailboxes, which totals to:\n\n\\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \\]\n\nHowever, the question asks how many pieces of junk mail each house will get, regardless of the color of the mailbox.
