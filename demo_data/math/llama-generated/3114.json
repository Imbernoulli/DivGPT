        "To determine how many meters Tobias swam during his 3-hour visit to the swimming pool, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.\n\nFirst, convert the total time Tobias spent at the pool from hours to minutes:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} = 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the pauses he took. Every 25 minutes, Tobias takes a 5-minute pause. This means that for every 30 minutes (25 minutes of swimming + 5 minutes of pause), he spends 25 minutes swimming.\n\nTo find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30:\n\\[ 180 \\div 30 = 6 \\]\n\nThis means there are 6 intervals of 30 minutes in 180 minutes. Since Tobias swims for 25 minutes in each 30-minute interval, the total time he spends swimming is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many meters Tobias swims in 150 minutes. Since swimming every 100 meters takes him 5 minutes, the number of meters he swims per minute is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ meters} \\div 5 \\text{ minutes} = 20 \\text{ meters per minute} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance Tobias swims in 150 minutes is:\n\\[ 150 \\text{ minutes} \\times 20 \\text{ meters per minute} = 3000 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nSo, the total distance Tobias swam during his visit to the swimming pool is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3000} \\]",

        "To determine how many meters Tobias swam during his visit to the swimming pool, we need to consider both the time he spent swimming and the time he spent taking pauses.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Tobias spent swimming. Tobias took a 5-minute pause every 25 minutes of swimming. This means that for every 30 minutes (25 minutes of swimming + 5 minutes of pause), he was actually swimming for 25 minutes.\n\nTobias was at the swimming pool for 3 hours, which is equivalent to \\(3 \\times 60 = 180\\) minutes. To find out how many 30-minute intervals fit into 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30:\n\\[\n180 \\div 30 = 6\n\\]\nThis means that Tobias completed 6 intervals of 30 minutes each. Since he swims for 25 minutes in each interval, the total time he spent swimming is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 25 = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many meters Tobias swam in 150 minutes. We know that it takes him 5 minutes to swim 100 meters. Therefore, the number of meters he swims in one minute is:\n\\[\n100 \\div 5 = 20 \\text{ meters per minute}\n\\]\nTo find out how many meters he swims in 150 minutes, we multiply 150 by 20:\n\\[\n150 \\times 20 = 3000 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of meters Tobias swam during his visit to the swimming pool is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3000}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many meters Tobias swam during his 3-hour visit to the swimming pool, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, convert the total time Tobias spent at the pool from hours to minutes:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} = 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the pauses Tobias took. every 25 minutes of swimming, he takes a 5-minute pause. So, for every 30 minutes (25 minutes of swimming + 5 minutes of pause), Tobias swims for 25 minutes.\n\nNow, determine how many 30-minute intervals fit into 180 minutes:\n\\[ 180 \\div 30 = 6 \\]\nThis means there are 6 intervals of 30 minutes in 180 minutes. Since Tobias swims for 25 minutes in each 30-minute interval, the total swimming time is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate how many 100-meter laps Tobias swims in 150 minutes. Since swimming each 100 meters takes 5 minutes, the number of 100-meter laps he swims is:\n\\[ 150 \\div 5 = 30 \\]\nTherefore, the total distance Tobias swims is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 100 = 3000 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nSo, the number of meters Tobias swam during his visit to the swimming pool is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3000} \\]",

To find out how many minutes he spends swimming in total, we multiply the number of cycles by the swimming time per cycle:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ cycles} \\times 25 \\text{ minutes/cycle} = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate how many meters Tobias swims in these 150 minutes. We know that he swims 100 meters every 5 minutes. Therefore, the number of 5-minute intervals in 150 minutes is:\n\\[\n\\frac{150 \\text{ minutes}}{5 \\text{ minutes/interval}} = 30 \\text{ intervals}\n\\]\n\nSince he swims 100 meters in each interval, the total distance he swims is:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ intervals} \\times 100 \\text{ meters/interval} = 3000 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of meters Tobias swam during his visit to the swimming pool is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3000}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many meters Tobias swam during his visit to the swimming pool, we need to break down his swimming and pause times step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Tobias spends swimming and pausing in one complete cycle of swimming and pausing. Each cycle consists of swimming for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute pause. Therefore, the total time for one complete cycle is:\n\\[ 25 + 5 = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many complete cycles fit into Tobias's 3-hour visit. Since 3 hours is equal to:\n\\[ 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nwe can find out how many complete cycles fit into 180 minutes by dividing 180 by 30:\n\\[ 180 \\div 30 = 6 \\]\nSo, Tobias completes 6 cycles during his 3-hour visit.\n\nIn each cycle, Tobias swims for 25 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends swimming in 6 cycles is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSince Tobias swims every 100 meters in 5 minutes, we can find out how many meters he swims in 150 minutes by determining how many 5-minute intervals fit into 150 minutes:\n\\[ 150 \\div 5 = 30 \\]\nSo, he swims for 30 intervals of 100 meters each. Therefore, the total distance he swims is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 100 = 3000 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of meters Tobias swam during his visit to the swimming pool is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3000} \\]",

Since swimming every 100 meters takes him 5 minutes, we can calculate the number of 100-meter lengths he swims by dividing the total swimming time by 5:\n\\[ 150 \\div 5 = 30 \\]\nSo, Tobias swims 30 lengths of 100 meters each. Therefore, the total distance he swims is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 100 = 3000 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3000} \\]",
