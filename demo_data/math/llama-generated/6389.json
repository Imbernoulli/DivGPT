        "To determine how many more chickens John took than Ray, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many chickens Mary took.\n2. Determine how many chickens John took.\n3. Calculate the difference between the number of chickens John took and the number of chickens Ray took.\n\nFirst, we know that Ray took 10 chickens. According to the problem, Ray took 6 chickens less than Mary. Therefore, we can find the number of chickens Mary took by adding 6 to the number of chickens Ray took:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of chickens Mary took} = 10 + 6 = 16\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that John took 5 more chickens than Mary. Therefore, we can find the number of chickens John took by adding 5 to the number of chickens Mary took:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of chickens John took} = 16 + 5 = 21\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more chickens John took than Ray. We do this by subtracting the number of chickens Ray took from the number of chickens John took:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 21 - 10 = 11\n\\]\n\nThus, John took \\(\\boxed{11}\\) more chickens than Ray.",
