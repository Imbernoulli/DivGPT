We do this by dividing 120 by 5:\n\\[ 120 \\div 5 = 24 \\]\n\nSo, Jeff scored 24 points. Since he wins a match when he scores 8 points, we need to find out how many sets of 8 points are in 24 points. We do this by dividing 24 by 8:\n\\[ 24 \\div 8 = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jeff won \\(\\boxed{3}\\) games.",
