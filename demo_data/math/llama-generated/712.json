Determine Hannah's age based on the given relationship between her age and the sum of her brothers' ages.\n\nFirst, let's find the sum of the ages of Hannah's three brothers. Since each brother is 8 years old and there are three brothers, we can calculate the sum as follows:\n\\[\n8 + 8 + 8 = 3 \\times 8 = 24\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Hannah is twice as old as the sum of her brothers' ages. Therefore, we multiply the sum of their ages by 2 to find Hannah's age:\n\\[\n2 \\times 24 = 48\n\\]\n\nThus, Hannah is \\(\\boxed{48}\\) years old.",
