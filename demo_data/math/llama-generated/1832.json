        "To determine Jan's height, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find Bill's height.\n2. Use Bill's height to find Jan's height.\n\nFirst, we know that Bill is half of Cary's height. Since Cary is 72 inches tall, we calculate Bill's height as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Bill's height} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Jan is 6 inches taller than Bill. Therefore, we add 6 inches to Bill's height to find Jan's height:\n\\[\n\\text{Jan's height} = 36 + 6 = 42 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThus, Jan's height is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",
