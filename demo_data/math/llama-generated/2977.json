        "To determine how much money Ed was left with after paying for his stay at the hotel, we need to calculate the cost of his stay and subtract it from the amount of money he initially had. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the cost of staying last night:\n   - The cost per hour last night was $1.50.\n   - Ed stayed for 6 hours last night.\n   - Therefore, the cost for last night is:\n     \\[\n     1.50 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 9 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. Calculate the cost of staying this morning:\n   - The cost per hour this morning was $2.\n   - Ed stayed for 4 hours this morning.\n   - Therefore, the cost for this morning is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. Calculate the total cost of the stay:\n   - The total cost is the sum of the cost for last night and the cost for this morning:\n     \\[\n     9 \\text{ dollars} + 8 \\text{ dollars} = 17 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. Calculate the amount of money Ed was left with after paying for his stay:\n   - Ed initially had $80.\n   - The total cost of the stay was $17.\n   - Therefore, the amount of money left is:\n     \\[\n     80 \\text{ dollars} - 17 \\text{ dollars} = 63 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money Ed was left with after paying for his stay at the hotel is \\(\\boxed{63}\\).",
