        "To determine how many passion fruit crates Kevin sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of crates Kevin sells per week.\n2. Identify the number of crates of grapes and mangoes he sold last week.\n3. Subtract the number of crates of grapes and mangoes from the total number of crates sold to find the number of passion fruit crates sold.\n\nHere are the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Kevin sells a total of 50 crates of fruit per week.\n2. Last week, he sold 13 crates of grapes and 20 crates of mangoes.\n3. The total number of crates of grapes and mangoes sold is \\(13 + 20 = 33\\).\n4. The number of passion fruit crates sold is the total number of crates minus the number of crates of grapes and mangoes, which is \\(50 - 33 = 17\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of passion fruit crates Kevin sold is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",
