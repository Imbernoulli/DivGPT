        "To determine how many kids who joined the rafting excursion were also on the tubing excursion, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of kids who went tubing.\n2. Determine how many of the tubers also went rafting.\n\nFirst, we know there were 40 kids on Lake Pleasant and a fourth of them went tubing. So, we calculate the number of kids who went tubing as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of kids who went tubing} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 40 = 10\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that only half of the tubers went rafting. So, we calculate the number of kids who went rafting as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of kids who went rafting} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 = 5\n\\]\n\nSince all the kids who went rafting were also among those who went tubing, the number of kids who joined the rafting excursion and were also on the tubing excursion is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
