        "To determine the number of children at the basketball match, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of women and children:**\n   - The total number of spectators is 10,000.\n   - The number of men is 7,000.\n   - Therefore, the number of women and children combined is:\n     \\[\n     10000 - 7000 = 3000\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the ratio of children to women:**\n   - There are 5 times as many children as women.
