        "To determine how much money Jenn will have left over after buying the bike, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of quarters Jenn has.\n2. Convert the total number of quarters into dollars.\n3. Subtract the cost of the bike from the total amount of money Jenn has.\n\nFirst, let's find out the total number of quarters Jenn has. She has 5 jars, and each jar can hold 160 quarters. So, we multiply the number of jars by the number of quarters per jar:\n\\[ 5 \\times 160 = 800 \\text{ quarters} \\]\n\nNext, we convert the total number of quarters into dollars. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply the total number of quarters by $0.25:\n\\[ 800 \\times 0.25 = 200 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the cost of the bike from the total amount of money Jenn has. The bike costs $180, so we subtract $180 from $200:\n\\[ 200 - 180 = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Jenn will have left over after buying the bike is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
