        "To determine the total number of fruits on the display, we start by identifying the number of each type of fruit based on the given relationships.\n\n1. **Number of Bananas:**\n   We are given that there are 5 bananas.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of bananas} = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of Oranges:**\n   According to the problem, there are twice as many oranges as bananas. Therefore, we calculate the number of oranges as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of oranges} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of bananas} = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of Apples:**\n   The problem states that there are twice as many apples as oranges. Therefore, we calculate the number of apples as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of apples} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of oranges} = 2 \\times 10 = 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Number of Fruits:**\n   To find the total number of fruits on the display, we sum the number of apples, oranges, and bananas:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of fruits} = \\text{Number of apples} + \\text{Number of oranges} + \\text{Number of bananas} = 20 + 10 + 5 = 35\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of fruits on the display is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",
