        "To determine how much money Chris will have left over after making his purchases, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Chris earns from babysitting.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the video game and the candy.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the purchases from the total amount of money earned.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Chris earns from babysitting:\n\\[ \\text{Total earnings} = \\text{Hourly wage} \\times \\text{Hours worked} = 8 \\, \\text{dollars/hour} \\times 9 \\, \\text{hours} = 72 \\, \\text{dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the video game and the candy:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of video game} + \\text{Cost of candy} = 60 \\, \\text{dollars} + 5 \\, \\text{dollars} = 65 \\, \\text{dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, let's subtract the total cost of the purchases from the total amount of money earned to find out how much money Chris will have left over:\n\\[ \\text{Money left over} = \\text{Total earnings} - \\text{Total cost} = 72 \\, \\text{dollars} - 65 \\, \\text{dollars} = 7 \\, \\text{dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Chris will have left over after making his purchases is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."
