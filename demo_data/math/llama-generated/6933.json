        "To determine the total number of leaves Sabrina needs, we start by identifying the number of each type of leaf based on the given relationships.\n\nFirst, we know that Sabrina needs 12 basil leaves. Let's denote the number of sage leaves by \\( s \\). According to the problem, she needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n12 = 2s\n\\]\nTo find \\( s \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\nSo, Sabrina needs 6 sage leaves.\n\nNext, we know that Sabrina needs 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. Let's denote the number of verbena leaves by \\( v \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\ns = v - 5\n\\]\nSince we already know that \\( s = 6 \\), we substitute 6 for \\( s \\) in the equation:\n\\[\n6 = v - 5\n\\]\nTo find \\( v \\), we add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nv = 6 + 5 = 11\n\\]\nSo, Sabrina needs 11 verbena leaves.\n\nNow, we add up the number of each type of leaf to find the total number of leaves Sabrina needs:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ (basil leaves)} + 6 \\text{ (sage leaves)} + 11 \\text{ (verbena leaves)} = 29\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of leaves Sabrina needs is \\(\\boxed{29}\\).",

Since she needs 12 basil leaves, we can write:\n\\[ 2S = 12 \\]\nSolving for \\( S \\), we get:\n\\[ S = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\]\nSo, Sabrina needs 6 sage leaves.\n\nThe problem also states that Sabrina needs 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves.
