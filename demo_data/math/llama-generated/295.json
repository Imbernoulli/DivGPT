        "To determine the total number of cutlery pieces Braelynn has in her kitchen after her purchases, we can break down the problem into a series of steps.\n\nFirst, we find out how many teaspoons Braelynn initially has.

She bought \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) as many additional knives as she originally had:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 24 = 8 \\text{ additional knives}\n\\]\nShe also bought \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) as many additional teaspoons as she originally had:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 48 = 32 \\text{ additional teaspoons}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the new total number of knives and teaspoons. The new total number of knives is:\n\\[\n24 + 8 = 32 \\text{ knives}\n\\]\nThe new total number of teaspoons is:\n\\[\n48 + 32 = 80 \\text{ teaspoons}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the new totals to get the total number of cutlery pieces:\n\\[\n32 + 80 = 112\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of cutlery pieces Braelynn has in her kitchen is \\(\\boxed{112}\\).",
