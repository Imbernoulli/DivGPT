        "To determine how many children Yasmin has, we need to analyze the information given step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the number of children Yasmin has.\n\n2. **Determine the number of children John has:**\n   - According to the problem, John has twice the number of children that Yasmin has. Therefore, John has \\( 2x \\) children.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of grandchildren:**\n   - Gabriel has six grandkids. These grandkids are the children of both John and Yasmin combined.\n\n4. **Set up the equation:**\n   - The total number of grandkids is the sum of John's children and Yasmin's children. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     x + 2x = 6\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:\n     \\[\n     3x = 6\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 3 to isolate \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{6}{3}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 2\n     \\]\n\nThus, Yasmin has \\(\\boxed{2}\\) children.",
