So, we calculate the number of video games Julia has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of video games Julia has} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Theresa has 5 more than thrice as many video games as Julia. So, we calculate the number of video games Theresa has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of video games Theresa has} = 3 \\times 2 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of video games Theresa has is \\boxed{11}.",
