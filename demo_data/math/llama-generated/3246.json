She likes to hunt for treasure on the ocean's floor, but when she finds something to keep, she must carry it back to the surface of the water to give it to her shipmate on the boat.  She can only carry 3 objects at a time while she swims underwater.  If she finds 17 objects underwater, what is the fewest number of trips to the surface of the water she must take to carry all 17 objects to the boat?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the fewest number of trips Gretchen must take to carry all 17 objects to the boat, we need to divide the total number of objects by the number of objects she can carry at a time. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the total number of objects Gretchen finds: 17.\n2. Identify the number of objects she can carry at a time: 3.\n3. Perform the division: \\(17 \\div 3\\).\n\nWhen we divide 17 by 3, we get:\n\\[17 \\div 3 = 5 \\text{ R } 2\\]\nThis means that 17 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 5 and a remainder of 2. The quotient tells us that Gretchen can make 5 full trips carrying 3 objects each, and the remainder tells us that she will have 2 objects left over after those 5 trips.\n\nSince Gretchen cannot carry the remaining 2 objects in a partial trip and must make a complete trip to carry them, she will need to make one additional trip. Therefore, the total number of trips she needs to make is:\n\\[5 + 1 = 6\\]\n\nSo, the fewest number of trips Gretchen must take to carry all 17 objects to the boat is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
