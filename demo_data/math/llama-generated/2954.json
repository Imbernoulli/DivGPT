The laptop costs $1000, and the shop requires a 20% down payment:\n\\[ \\text{Down payment} = 1000 \\times 0.20 = 200 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, so the total down payment is:\n\\[ \\text{Total down payment} = 200 + 20 = 220 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the remaining balance after the down payment:\n\\[ \\text{Remaining balance} = 1000 - 220 = 780 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTara pays $65 per month in installments. After 4 months, the amount paid in installments is:\n\\[ \\text{Amount paid in installments} = 65 \\times 4 = 260 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the amount paid in installments from the remaining balance to find Tara's balance after 4 months:\n\\[ \\text{Balance after 4 months} = 780 - 260 = 520 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Tara's balance after paying for 4 months is:\n\\[ \\boxed{520} \\]",
