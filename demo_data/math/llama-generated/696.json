        "To determine the cost of the candy bar, we first need to calculate the total amount of money John gave to the cashier. John paid with 4 quarters, 3 dimes, and a nickel. Let's convert these amounts into cents:\n\n- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 4 quarters are worth \\(4 \\times 25 = 100\\) cents.\n- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 3 dimes are worth \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\) cents.\n- Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 1 nickel is worth \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) cents.\n\nAdding these amounts together, the total amount John gave to the cashier is:\n\\[100 + 30 + 5 = 135\\] cents.\n\nJohn received 4 cents back in change. Therefore, the cost of the candy bar is the total amount given to the cashier minus the change he received:\n\\[135 - 4 = 131\\] cents.\n\nSo, the cost of the candy bar is \\(\\boxed{131}\\).",
