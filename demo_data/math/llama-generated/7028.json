        "To determine how many slices of pizza each person ate, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices.\n2. Determine the total number of people who ate the pizza.\n3. Divide the total number of slices by the total number of people.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since each pizza has 8 slices and there are 3 pizzas, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ pizzas} \\times 8 \\text{ slices per pizza} = 24 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the total number of people who ate the pizza. John and his five friends make a total of 6 people:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ (John)} + 5 \\text{ (friends)} = 6 \\text{ people} \\]\n\nNow, we divide the total number of slices by the total number of people to find out how many slices each person ate:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ slices} \\div 6 \\text{ people} = 4 \\text{ slices per person} \\]\n\nTherefore, each person ate \\(\\boxed{4}\\) slices."
