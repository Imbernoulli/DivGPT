So, the total weight of the cats is:\n\\[ 14 \\times 2.5 = 35 \\text{ kilograms} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many kilograms more the cats weigh than the puppies. We do this by subtracting the total weight of the puppies from the total weight of the cats:\n\\[ 35 - 30 = 5 \\text{ kilograms} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cats weigh \\(\\boxed{5}\\) kilograms more than the puppies.",
