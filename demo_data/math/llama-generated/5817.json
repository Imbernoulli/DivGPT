        "Let's start by determining how many cotton candies Cersei gave to her brother and sister. She gave 5 cotton candies to each, so:\n\n\\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \\]\n\nThis means she gave away 10 cotton candies to her brother and sister. Next, we need to find out how many cotton candies she has left after giving these away:\n\n\\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \\]\n\nNow, Cersei gave one-fourth of the remaining cotton candies to her cousin. So, we calculate one-fourth of 40:\n\n\\[ \\frac{40}{4} = 10 \\]\n\nThis means she gave away 10 cotton candies to her cousin. Now, we subtract the 10 cotton candies given to her cousin from the 40 cotton candies she had left:\n\n\\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \\]\n\nFinally, Cersei ate 12 cotton candies. So, we subtract 12 cotton candies from the 30 cotton candies she had left:\n\n\\[ 30 - 12 = 18 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cotton candies left is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]",
