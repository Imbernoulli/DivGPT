Subtract the total expenditure from the amount of money Celine has to find the change.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. **Total cost of the laptops:**\n   Celine buys two laptops, and each laptop costs $600.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 600 = 1200\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the laptops is $1200.\n\n2. **Total cost of the smartphones:**\n   Celine buys four smartphones, and each smartphone costs $400.\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 400 = 1600\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the smartphones is $1600.\n\n3. **Total expenditure:**\n   Add the total cost of the laptops and the total cost of the smartphones.\n   \\[\n   1200 + 1600 = 2800\n   \\]\n   So, the total expenditure is $2800.\n\n4. **Change:**\n   Subtract the total expenditure from the amount of money Celine has.\n   \\[\n   3000 - 2800 = 200\n   \\]\n   So, the change Celine gets back is $200.\n\nTherefore, the change Celine gets back is \\boxed{200}.",
