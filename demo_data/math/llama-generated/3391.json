        "To determine the number of spots Jean has located on her sides, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the total number of spots on Jean's body:**\n   - We know that half of her spots are located on her upper torso.\n   - Jean has 30 spots on her upper torso.\n   - Let \\( T \\) be the total number of spots on her body.\n   - Since half of her spots are on her upper torso, we can write:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2}T = 30\n     \\]\n   - To find \\( T \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n     \\[\n     T = 30 \\times 2 = 60\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of spots on her back and hindquarters:**\n   - One-third of her spots are located on her back and hindquarters.\n   - Therefore, we calculate:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{3}T = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of spots on her sides:**\n   - The remaining spots are located on her sides.\n   - We already know the total number of spots \\( T = 60 \\), and we have found that 30 spots are on her upper torso and 20 spots are on her back and hindquarters.\n   - Thus, the number of spots on her sides is:\n     \\[\n     T - (\\text{upper torso spots} + \\text{back and hindquarters spots}) = 60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of spots Jean has located on her sides is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of spots Jean the jaguar has, we start by noting that half of her spots are located on her upper torso. Given that she has 30 spots on her upper torso, we can express this as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of spots on upper torso} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Total number of spots}\n\\]\n\nLet \\( T \\) represent the total number of spots.

To find the number of spots on her sides, we subtract the number of spots on her upper torso and the number of spots on her back and hindquarters from the total number of spots:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of spots on her sides} = x - \\left( \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{3}x \\right)\n\\]\n\nFirst, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). The least common denominator is 6. So, we can rewrite \\(\\frac{1}{2}x\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}x\\) as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}x = \\frac{3}{6}x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{2}{6}x\n\\]\n\nAdding these fractions together, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{3}{6}x + \\frac{2}{6}x = \\frac{5}{6}x\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\frac{5}{6}x\\) back into our equation for the number of spots on her sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of spots on her sides} = x - \\frac{5}{6}x = \\frac{6}{6}x - \\frac{5}{6}x = \\frac{1}{6}x\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x = 60 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of spots on her sides} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 60 = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of spots Jean has located on her sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",

Next, we need to determine how many spots are located on her back and hindquarters. The problem states that one-third of the spots are located on her back and hindquarters. Therefore, the number of spots on her back and hindquarters is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} T = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 20\n\\]\n\nNow, we know the number of spots on her upper torso is 30, and the number of spots on her back and hindquarters is 20. To find the number of spots on her sides, we subtract the number of spots on her upper torso and her back and hindquarters from the total number of spots:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of spots on her sides} = T - \\text{Number of spots on her upper torso} - \\text{Number of spots on her back and hindquarters} = 60 - 30 - 20 = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of spots Jean has located on her sides is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
