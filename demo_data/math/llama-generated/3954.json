The gazelle can run for speeds of up to 40 miles per hour.  If one mile per hour is about 1.5 feet per second, then how many seconds would it take for a cheetah traveling at top speed to catch up to a fleeing gazelle also running at top speed if the two animals were initially 210 feet apart and they both traveled in the same direction?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how long it will take for a cheetah to catch up to a gazelle, we need to calculate the relative speed between the two animals and then use that speed to find the time it takes to cover the initial distance between them.\n\nFirst, we convert the speeds of the cheetah and the gazelle from miles per hour to feet per second. Since 1 mile per hour is approximately 1.5 feet per second, we have:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ mph} = 60 \\times 1.5 = 90 \\text{ feet per second} \\]\n\\[ 40 \\text{ mph} = 40 \\times 1.5 = 60 \\text{ feet per second} \\]\n\nNext, we find the relative speed of the cheetah with respect to the gazelle. Since they are both running in the same direction, we subtract the speed of the gazelle from the speed of the cheetah:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ feet per second} - 60 \\text{ feet per second} = 30 \\text{ feet per second} \\]\n\nThis means that the cheetah is closing the gap between itself and the gazelle at a rate of 30 feet per second. The initial distance between the cheetah and the gazelle is 210 feet. To find the time it takes for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle, we divide the initial distance by the relative speed:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{210 \\text{ feet}}{30 \\text{ feet per second}} = 7 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take the cheetah \\(\\boxed{7}\\) seconds to catch up to the gazelle.",
