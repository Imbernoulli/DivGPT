        "To determine how many hours of sleep Tom is behind on from the last week, we need to calculate the total amount of sleep he actually got and compare it to the total amount of sleep he would ideally like to get.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the actual amount of sleep Tom got:\n- Tom gets 5 hours of sleep each weeknight. There are 5 weeknights, so:\n  \\[\n  5 \\text{ hours/night} \\times 5 \\text{ nights} = 25 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n- Tom gets 6 hours of sleep each night on the weekend.
