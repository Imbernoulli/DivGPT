The first lock she tries stalls them for 5 minutes. The next lock stalls them for 3 minutes less than three times as long as the first lock. When Karen tries both locks at once, it stalled the raccoons for five times as long as the second lock alone. How long is that?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how long the raccoons are stalled when Karen tries both locks at once, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the duration of the second lock:**\n   - The first lock stalls the raccoons for 5 minutes.\n   - The second lock stalls them for 3 minutes less than three times as long as the first lock.\n   - Calculate three times the duration of the first lock:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 3 minutes from this result:\n     \\[\n     15 - 3 = 12 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   Therefore, the second lock stalls the raccoons for 12 minutes.\n\n2. **Determine the duration when both locks are used together:**\n   - When both locks are tried at once, it stalls the raccoons for five times as long as the second lock alone.\n   - Calculate five times the duration of the second lock:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 12 = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   Therefore, when both locks are used together, they stall the raccoons for 60 minutes.\n\nThus, the total time the raccoons are stalled when Karen tries both locks at once is \\(\\boxed{60}\\) minutes.",
        "Let's define the time the first lock stalls the raccoons as \\( x \\) minutes. According to the problem, the first lock stalls the raccoons for 5 minutes, so we have:\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the time the second lock stalls the raccoons. The problem states that the second lock stalls the raccoons for 3 minutes less than three times as long as the first lock. Therefore, we can express the time the second lock stalls the raccoons as:\n\\[ 3x - 3 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( x \\) into this expression, we get:\n\\[ 3(5) - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 \\]\nSo, the second lock stalls the raccoons for 12 minutes.\n\nWhen Karen tries both locks at once, it stalls the raccoons for five times as long as the second lock alone.
