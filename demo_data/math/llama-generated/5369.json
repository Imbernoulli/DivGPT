        "To determine how many pounds of vegetables James eats a week after adding the kale, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial daily vegetable consumption:**\n   - James eats a quarter pound of asparagus per day.\n   - James eats a quarter pound of broccoli per day.\n   - Total daily consumption: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ pound (asparagus)} + \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ pound (broccoli)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ pound}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the initial weekly vegetable consumption:**\n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - Total weekly consumption:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ pound/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 3.5 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the new daily vegetable consumption after 2 weeks:**\n   - James doubles his initial daily consumption.\n   - New daily consumption:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ pound} = 1 \\text{ pound}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the new weekly vegetable consumption without kale:**\n   - Total weekly consumption with doubled portions:\n     \\[\n     1 \\text{ pound/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 7 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Add the kale consumption to the new weekly vegetable consumption:**\n   - James adds 3 pounds of kale per week.\n   - Total weekly consumption with kale:\n     \\[\n     7 \\text{ pounds} + 3 \\text{ pounds} = 10 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pounds of vegetables James eats a week after adding the kale is \\boxed{10}.",
