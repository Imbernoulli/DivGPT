        "To determine how many more pages Dustin reads in 40 minutes compared to Sam, we need to calculate the number of pages each person reads in 40 minutes and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many pages Dustin reads in 40 minutes. Dustin can read 75 pages in 60 minutes. Therefore, in 40 minutes, he reads:\n\\[\n\\frac{75 \\text{ pages}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} \\times 40 \\text{ minutes} = 50 \\text{ pages}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate how many pages Sam reads in 40 minutes.

Therefore, in 40 minutes, he reads:\n\\[\n\\frac{24 \\text{ pages}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} \\times 40 \\text{ minutes} = 16 \\text{ pages}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in the number of pages read by Dustin and Sam in 40 minutes:\n\\[\n50 \\text{ pages} - 16 \\text{ pages} = 34 \\text{ pages}\n\\]\n\nThus, Dustin reads \\(\\boxed{34}\\) more pages in 40 minutes compared to Sam.",

Dustin reads 75 pages in one hour. Since one hour is 60 minutes, we can find out how many pages he reads in 40 minutes by using a proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Pages Dustin reads in 40 minutes} = \\left(\\frac{40}{60}\\right) \\times 75 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\times 75 = 50\n\\]\n\nSo, Dustin reads 50 pages in 40 minutes.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of pages Sam reads in 40 minutes.

Therefore, we can set up the following proportion to find out how many pages he reads in 40 minutes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{75 \\text{ pages}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{x \\text{ pages}}{40 \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{75 \\text{ pages} \\times 40 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{3000 \\text{ pages} \\cdot \\text{minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = 50 \\text{ pages}\n\\]\n\nSo, Dustin reads 50 pages in 40 minutes.\n\nNext, let's find out how many pages Sam reads in 40 minutes. Sam reads 24 pages in one hour, which is 60 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion to find out how many pages he reads in 40 minutes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{24 \\text{ pages}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{y \\text{ pages}}{40 \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{24 \\text{ pages} \\times 40 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{960 \\text{ pages} \\cdot \\text{minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = 16 \\text{ pages}\n\\]\n\nSo, Sam reads 16 pages in 40 minutes.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the number of pages Dustin reads and the number of pages Sam reads:\n\n\\[\n50 \\text{ pages} - 16 \\text{ pages} = 34 \\text{ pages}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Dustin reads \\(\\boxed{34}\\) more pages than Sam in 40 minutes.",
        "To determine how many more pages Dustin reads in 40 minutes compared to Sam, we need to calculate the number of pages each person reads in that time and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many pages Dustin reads in 40 minutes. Dustin's reading rate is 75 pages per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find his reading rate in pages per minute by dividing 75 by 60:\n\n\\[ 75 \\div 60 = 1.25 \\text{ pages per minute} \\]\n\nNext, we multiply this rate by 40 minutes to find out how many pages Dustin reads in 40 minutes:\n\n\\[ 1.25 \\times 40 = 50 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate how many pages Sam reads in 40 minutes.

Using the same proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Pages Sam reads in 40 minutes} = \\left(\\frac{24 \\text{ pages}}{60 \\text{ minutes}}\\right) \\times 40 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{60} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\nNow multiply:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) \\times 40 = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\text{ pages}\n\\]\n\nSo, Sam reads 16 pages in 40 minutes.\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of pages Dustin reads and the number of pages Sam reads:\n\n\\[\n50 \\text{ pages} - 16 \\text{ pages} = 34 \\text{ pages}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Dustin reads \\(\\boxed{34}\\) more pages than Sam in 40 minutes.",
