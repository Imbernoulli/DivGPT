According to the problem, 60% of the students are girls, which means that 40% of the students are boys. We know that the number of boys is 300. Therefore, we can write the following equation to represent the relationship between the number of boys and the total number of students:\n\n\\[ 0.40 \\times T = 300 \\]\n\nTo find the total number of students \\( T \\), we need to solve for \\( T \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{300}{0.40} \\]\n\nPerforming the division, we get:\n\n\\[ T = 750 \\]\n\nNow that we know the total number of students at the school is 750, we can find the number of girls by calculating 60% of the total number of students:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \\times 750 \\]\n\nPerforming the multiplication, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of girls} = 450 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of girls at the school is \\(\\boxed{450}\\).",
