        "To determine how many pounds of lingonberries Steve had to pick on Thursday, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from Monday to Wednesday and then find out how much more he needs to earn on Thursday to reach his goal of $100.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the earnings for each day:\n\n1. **Monday:**\n   - Steve picked 8 pounds.\n   - Earnings: \\( 8 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$2/\\text{pound} = \\$16 \\).\n\n2. **Tuesday:**\n   - Steve picked triple the amount he picked on Monday.\n   - Pounds picked: \\( 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\text{ pounds} \\).\n   - Earnings: \\( 24 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$2/\\text{pound} = \\$48 \\).\n\n3. **Wednesday:**\n   - Steve\tdie to rest.\n   - Pounds picked: 0 pounds.\n   - Earnings: \\( 0 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$2/\\text{pound} = \\$0 \\).\n\nNext, we sum up the earnings from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:\n\\[\n\\$16 + \\$48 + \\$0 = \\$64\n\\]\n\nSteve's goal is to earn $100.

Therefore, the amount of money he earned on Tuesday is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 8 \\text{ pounds} = 24 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n   Since the job pays $2 per pound, the amount of money he earned on Tuesday is:\n   \\[\n   24 \\text{ pounds} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/pound} = 48 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the total amount of money Steve earned on Monday and Tuesday:\n   Adding the amounts from Monday and Tuesday, we get:\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ dollars} + 48 \\text{ dollars} = 64 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. Determine how much more money Steve needs to earn to reach his goal of $100:\n   Subtract the total amount of money he earned on Monday and Tuesday from $100:\n   \\[\n   100 \\text{ dollars} - 64 \\text{ dollars} = 36 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Since the job pays $2 per pound, the number of pounds of lingonberries Steve needs to pick on Thursday is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36 \\text{ dollars}}{2 \\text{ dollars/pound}} = 18 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pounds of lingonberries Steve had to pick on Thursday is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

Since he picked triple the amount he picked on Monday:\n\\[ \\text{Tuesday's earnings} = 3 \\times 8 \\text{ pounds} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per pound} = 3 \\times 16 \\text{ dollars} = 48 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nOn Wednesday, Steve did not pick any lingonberries, so his earnings for Wednesday are:\n\\[ \\text{Wednesday's earnings} = 0 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of money Steve earned from Monday to Wednesday:\n\\[ \\text{Total earnings from Monday to Wednesday} = 16 \\text{ dollars} + 48 \\text{ dollars} + 0 \\text{ dollars} = 64 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSteve wants to make a total of $100 within four days. Therefore, he needs to earn:\n\\[ \\text{Remaining earnings needed} = 100 \\text{ dollars} - 64 \\text{ dollars} = 36 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince the job pays $2 for every pound of lingonberries picked, the number of pounds of lingonberries Steve needs to pick on Thursday is:\n\\[ \\text{Pounds of lingonberries needed} = \\frac{36 \\text{ dollars}}{2 \\text{ dollars per pound}} = 18 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThus, the number of pounds of lingonberries Steve had to pick on Thursday is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

        "To determine how many pounds of lingonberries Steve had to pick on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of pounds he picked over the first three days and then find out how many more pounds he needs to pick to reach his goal of $100.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pounds Steve picked on each day:\n- On Monday, Steve picked 8 pounds.\n- On Tuesday, he picked triple what he picked on Monday. Therefore, he picked \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\) pounds.\n- On Wednesday, he mattress to rest, so he picked 0 pounds.\n\nNext, we sum the pounds picked over the first three days:\n\\[8 + 24 + 0 = 32\\]\n\nSteve's job pays $2 for every pound of lingonberries picked. So, the total earnings for the first three days are:\n\\[32 \\times 2 = 64\\]\n\nSteve's goal is to make $100.
