        "To determine the length of Jason's dog's tail, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the length of the dog's body. We are given that the total length of the dog is 30 inches, and this length includes the head, body, and tail. However, since the head and tail are fractions of the body, we can focus on the body length itself.\n\n2. Let's denote the length of the dog's body as \\( B \\). According to the problem, the head is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of the body length and the tail is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the body length. Therefore, the total length of the dog can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total length} = B + \\text{Head} + \\text{Tail} = B + \\frac{1}{6}B + \\frac{1}{2}B\n   \\]\n\n3. Combine the terms on the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   B + \\frac{1}{6}B + \\frac{1}{2}B = B \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. To add the fractions inside the parentheses, find a common denominator. The common denominator for 6, 1, and 2 is 6:\n   \\[\n   1 + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{3}{6} = 1 + \\frac{4}{6} = 1 + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}\n   \\]\n\n5. Substitute \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\) back into the equation for the total length:\n   \\[\n   30 = B \\cdot \\frac{5}{3}\n   \\]\n\n6. To solve for \\( B \\), multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\), which is \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\):\n   \\[\n   B = 30 \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = 30 \\cdot 0.6 = 18\n   \\]\n   So, the length of the dog's body is 18 inches.\n\n7. Now, calculate the length of the dog's tail, which is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of the body length:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tail length} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 18 = 9\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of Jason's dog's tail is \\(\\boxed{9}\\) inches.",

The least common multiple of 6, 1, and 2 is 6.
