        "To determine the initial number of marbles Stuart had, we start by calculating how many marbles Betty gave to Stuart. Betty had 60 marbles and she gave 40% of her collection to Stuart. Therefore, the number of marbles Betty gave to Stuart is:\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 0.40 = 24 \\]\n\nAfter receiving these 24 marbles, Stuart's collection increased to 80 marbles. Let \\( x \\) be the initial number of marbles Stuart had. According to the problem, after receiving 24 marbles from Betty, Stuart's collection became 80 marbles. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n\n\\[ x + 24 = 80 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ x = 80 - 24 = 56 \\]\n\nThus, the initial number of marbles Stuart had is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56} \\]",
        "To determine how many marbles Stuart had initially, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how many marbles Betty gave to Stuart.\n2. Determine how many marbles Stuart had before receiving any from Betty.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many marbles Betty gave to Stuart. Betty gave Stuart 40% of her marble collection. Since Betty had 60 marbles, we find 40% of 60:\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 60 = 24\n\\]\nSo, Betty gave Stuart 24 marbles.\n\nNext, we know that after receiving 24 marbles from Betty, Stuart's collection increased to 80 marbles.
