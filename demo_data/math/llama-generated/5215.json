        "To determine how long Kim spent away from home, we need to break down the problem into several parts: the time it takes for her to drive to her friend's house, the time it takes for her to drive back after the detour, and the time she spends at her friend's house.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Kim to drive to her friend's house:\n\\[ \\text{Time to drive to her friend's house} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{30 \\text{ miles}}{44 \\text{ mph}} = \\frac{30}{44} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{15}{22} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the distance of the detour on the way back. The detour is 20% longer than the original 30 miles:\n\\[ \\text{Distance of the detour} = 30 \\text{ miles} + 0.20 \\times 30 \\text{ miles} = 30 \\text{ miles} + 6 \\text{ miles} = 36 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the time it takes for Kim to drive back after the detour:\n\\[ \\text{Time to drive back} = \\frac{\\text{Distance of the detour}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{36 \\text{ miles}}{44 \\text{ mph}} = \\frac{36}{44} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{9}{11} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the time Kim spends at her friend's house from minutes to hours:\n\\[ \\text{Time spent at her friend's house} = 30 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{30}{60} \\text{ hours} = 0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we add up all the times to find out how long Kim spent away from home:\n\\[ \\text{Total time spent away from home} = \\text{Time to drive to her friend's house} + \\text{Time spent at her friend's house} + \\text{Time to drive back} = \\frac{15}{22} \\text{ hours} + 0.5 \\text{ hours} + \\frac{9}{11} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 22 and 11 is 22. So, we rewrite 0.5 as a fraction with a denominator of 22:\n\\[ 0.5 = \\frac{0.5 \\times 22}{22} = \\frac{11}{22} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{9}{11} = \\frac{9 \\times 2}{11 \\times 2} = \\frac{18}{22} \\]\n\nNow we can add the fractions:\n\\[ \\text{Total time spent away from home} = \\frac{15}{22} + \\frac{11}{22} + \\frac{18}{22} = \\frac{15 + 11 + 18}{22} = \\frac{44}{22} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Kim spent away from home is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",

The time \\( t_1 \\) is given by the formula:\n\\[\nt_1 = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{30}{44} = \\frac{15}{22} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nNext, we need to calculate the time it takes for Kim to drive back after the detour. The detour is 20% longer than the original 30 miles, so the distance she drives back is:\n\\[\n30 + 0.2 \\times 30 = 30 + 6 = 36 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\nThe time \\( t_2 \\) it takes to drive 36 miles at a speed of 44 mph is:\n\\[\nt_2 = \\frac{36}{44} = \\frac{9}{11} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nNow, we know the time Kim spends at her friend's house is 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. Therefore, the total time Kim spends away from home is the sum of the time it takes to drive to her friend's house, the time it takes to drive back, and the time she spends at her friend's house:\n\\[\nt_{\\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 + 0.5 = \\frac{15}{22} + \\frac{9}{11} + 0.5\n\\]\nTo add these times together, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 22, 11, and 2 (since 0.5 is equivalent to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)) is 44. We convert each fraction to have a denominator of 44:\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{22} = \\frac{15 \\times 2}{22 \\times 2} = \\frac{30}{44}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{11} = \\frac{9 \\times 4}{11 \\times 4} = \\frac{36}{44}\n\\]\n\\[\n0.5 = \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1 \\times 22}{2 \\times 22} = \\frac{22}{44}\n\\]\nNow we can add the fractions:\n\\[\nt_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{30}{44} + \\frac{36}{44} + \\frac{22}{44} = \\frac{30 + 36 + 22}{44} = \\frac{88}{44} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nTherefore, the total time Kim spent away from home is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",

        "To determine the total time Kim spent away from home, we need to consider both the time she spent driving to her friend's house, the time she spent at her friend's house, and the time she spent driving back home.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Kim drove back home. The detour she took is 20% longer than the original 30 miles. So, the distance back home is:\n\\[ 30 + 0.2 \\times 30 = 30 + 6 = 36 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the time Kim spent driving to her friend's house. Since she drives at a speed of 44 mph, the time taken to drive 30 miles is:\n\\[ \\frac{30}{44} = \\frac{15}{22} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the time Kim spent driving back home. The time taken to drive 36 miles at a speed of 44 mph is:\n\\[ \\frac{36}{44} = \\frac{9}{11} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we add the time spent driving to her friend's house, the time spent at her friend's house, and the time spent driving back home. First, we convert the time spent at her friend's house from minutes to hours:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo, the total time spent away from home is:\n\\[ \\frac{15}{22} + 0.5 + \\frac{9}{11} \\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 22 and 11 is 22. So, we rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 22:\n\\[ \\frac{15}{22} + \\frac{0.5 \\times 22}{11} + \\frac{9 \\times 2}{22} = \\frac{15}{22} + \\frac{11}{22} + \\frac{18}{22} = \\frac{15 + 11 + 18}{22} = \\frac{44}{22} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Kim spent away from home is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
        "To determine how long Kim spent away from home, we need to break down the problem into several steps: calculating the distance she drove on the way back, finding the total distance driven, determining the total time spent driving, and adding the time spent at her friend's house.\n\n1. **Calculate the distance Kim drove on the way back:**\n   The detour is 20% longer than the original 30 miles. So, the distance on the way back is:\n   \\[\n   30 + 0.20 \\times 30 = 30 + 6 = 36 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the total distance driven:**\n   The total distance driven is the sum of the distance to her friend's house and the distance back:\n   \\[\n   30 + 36 = 66 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total time spent driving:**\n   Kim drives at a speed of 44 mph. The time spent driving is the total distance divided by the speed:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{66}{44} = 1.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Add the time spent at her friend's house:**\n   Kim spends 30 minutes at her friend's house. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total time spent away from home is:\n   \\[\n   1.5 + 0.5 = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
        "To determine how long Kim spent away from home, we need to break down the problem into clear steps.\n\n1. Calculate the distance Kim drives on the way back.\n   - The original distance to her friend's house is 30 miles.\n   - The detour is 20% longer than the original distance.\n   - Therefore, the distance of the detour is \\(30 + 0.2 \\times 30 = 30 + 6 = 36\\) miles.\n\n2. Calculate the total distance Kim drives.\n   - The distance to her friend's house is 30 miles.\n   - The distance back is 36 miles.\n   - So, the total distance is \\(30 + 36 = 66\\) miles.\n\n3. Calculate the time Kim spends driving.\n   - Kim drives at a speed of 44 mph.\n   - The total distance is 66 miles.\n   - Therefore, the time spent driving is \\(\\frac{66}{44} = 1.5\\) hours.\n\n4. Calculate the total time Kim spends away from home.\n   - Kim spends 1.5 hours driving.\n   - Kim spends 30 minutes at her friend's house, which is \\(\\frac{30}{60} = 0.5\\) hours.\n   - So, the total time spent away from home is \\(1.5 + 0.5 = 2\\) hours.\n\nThe total time Kim spent away from home is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) hours.",
        "To determine how long Kim spent away from home, we need to calculate the time she spent driving to her friend's house, the time she spent driving back after the detour, and the time she spent at her friend's house.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Kim spent driving to her friend's house. The distance is 30 miles and her speed is 44 mph. The time taken to drive to her friend's house is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time to friend's house} = \\frac{30 \\text{ miles}}{44 \\text{ mph}} = \\frac{30}{44} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{15}{22} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the distance Kim drove on the way back. The detour is 20% longer than the original 30 miles, so the distance she drove on the way back is:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance on the way back} = 30 \\text{ miles} + 0.20 \\times 30 \\text{ miles} = 30 \\text{ miles} + 6 \\text{ miles} = 36 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\nThe time taken to drive back is:\n\\[\n\\text{Time to drive back} = \\frac{36 \\text{ miles}}{44 \\text{ mph}} = \\frac{36}{44} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{9}{11} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add up the time spent driving to her friend's house, the time spent at her friend's house, and the time spent driving back:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time spent away from home} = \\frac{15}{22} \\text{ hours} + \\frac{9}{11} \\text{ hours} + 30 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nTo add these times together, we need to convert 30 minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{30}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nNow, we need a common denominator to add the fractions \\(\\frac{15}{22}\\), \\(\\frac{9}{11}\\), and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). The least common multiple of 22, 11, and 2 is 22. So, we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 22:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{11} = \\frac{9 \\times 2}{11 \\times 2} = \\frac{18}{22}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1 \\times 11}{2 \\times 11} = \\frac{11}{22}\n\\]\nNow, we can add the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{22} + \\frac{18}{22} + \\frac{11}{22} = \\frac{15 + 18 + 11}{22} = \\frac{44}{22} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nTherefore, the total time Kim spent away from home is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
        "To determine how long Kim spent away from home, we need to consider the distance she drove to her friend's house, the distance she drove back after the detour, and the time she spent at her friend's house.\n\n1. **Distance to puzzles's house:**\n   Kim drives 30 miles to her friend's house.\n\n2. **Distance back with the detour:**\n   The detour is 20% longer than the original distance. First, we calculate 20% of 30 miles:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 30 = 6 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n   Adding this to the original distance:\n   \\[\n   30 + 6 = 36 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total distance driven:**\n   The total distance Kim drives is the sum of the distance to her friend's house and the distance back:\n   \\[\n   30 + 36 = 66 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Time spent driving:**\n   Kim drives at a speed of 44 mph.

        "To determine how long Kim spent away from home, we need to calculate the time she spent driving to her friend's house, the time she spent driving back after the detour, and the time she spent at her friend's house. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the time spent driving to her friend's house:**\n   The distance to her friend's house is 30 miles, and she drives at a speed of 44 mph. The time taken is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{30 \\text{ miles}}{44 \\text{ mph}} = \\frac{30}{44} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{15}{22} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the time spent driving back after the detour:**\n   The detour is 20% longer than the original 30 miles. So the distance she drives back is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ miles} + 0.20 \\times 30 \\text{ miles} = 30 \\text{ miles} + 6 \\text{ miles} = 36 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n   The time taken to drive back is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{36 \\text{ miles}}{44 \\text{ mph}} = \\frac{36}{44} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{9}{11} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total time spent away from home:**\n   The total time spent away from home is the sum of the time spent driving to her friend's house, the time spent at her friend's house, and the time spent driving back. First, we need to convert the time spent at her friend's house from minutes to hours:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{30}{60} \\text{ hours} = 0.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   Now, we add up all the times:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\frac{15}{22} \\text{ hours} + 0.5 \\text{ hours} + \\frac{9}{11} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 22, 1, and 11 is 22. So we rewrite 0.5 as \\(\\frac{11}{22}\\) and \\(\\frac{9}{11}\\) as \\(\\frac{18}{22}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\frac{15}{22} + \\frac{11}{22} + \\frac{18}{22} = \\frac{15 + 11 + 18}{22} = \\frac{44}{22} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Kim spent away from home is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) hours.",
        "To determine how long Kim spent away from home, we need to break down the problem into several parts: the time taken to drive to her friend's house, the time taken to drive back after the detour, and the time spent at her friend's house.\n\n1. **Calculate the distance Kim drove back:**\n   - The original distance to her friend's house is 30 miles.\n   - The detour is 20% longer than the original distance.\n   - The length of the detour is \\(30 \\times 1.20 = 36\\) miles.\n   \n2. **Calculate the time taken to drive to her friend's house:**\n   - The distance to her friend's house is 30 miles.\n   - She drives at a speed of 44 mph.\n   - The time taken to drive to her friend's house is \\(\\frac{30}{44} = \\frac{15}{22}\\) hours.\n   \n3. **Calculate the time taken to drive back:**\n   - The distance back is 36 miles.\n   - She drives at a speed of 44 mph.\n   - The time taken to drive back is \\(\\frac{36}{44} = \\frac{9}{11}\\) hours.\n   \n4. **Convert the time spent at her friend's house to hours:**\n   - She spends 30 minutes at her friend's house.\n   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is \\(\\frac{30}{60} = \\frac{1}{2}\\) hours.\n   \n5. **Calculate the total time spent away from home:**\n   - The total time is the sum of the time taken to drive to her friend's house, the time taken to drive back, and the time spent at her friend's house.\n   - The total time is \\(\\frac{15}{22} + \\frac{9}{11} + \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n   - To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 22, 11, and 2 is 22.\n   - Rewrite \\(\\frac{9}{11}\\) as \\(\\frac{18}{22}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) as \\(\\frac{11}{22}\\).\n   - The total time is \\(\\frac{15}{22} + \\frac{18}{22} + \\frac{11}{22} = \\frac{44}{22} = 2\\) hours.\n   \nTherefore, the total time Kim spent away from home is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) hours.",

The detour is 20% longer than the original 30 miles, so the distance she drives back is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Detour distance} = 30 \\text{ miles} + 0.20 \\times 30 \\text{ miles} = 30 \\text{ miles} + 6 \\text{ miles} = 36 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThe time taken to drive back is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time to drive back} = \\frac{36 \\text{ miles}}{44 \\text{ mph}} = \\frac{36}{44} = \\frac{9}{11} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, convert the time spent at her friend's house from minutes to hours. She spends 30 minutes at her friend's house, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time at friend's house} = \\frac{30 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes per hour}} = 0.5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, add up all the times to find the total time Kim spent away from home:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time away} = \\text{Time to friend's house} + \\text{Time to drive back} + \\text{Time at friend's house} = \\frac{15}{22} + \\frac{9}{11} + 0.5\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 22 and 11 is 22. So, convert \\(\\frac{9}{11}\\) to a fraction with a denominator of 22:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{11} = \\frac{9 \\times 2}{11 \\times 2} = \\frac{18}{22}\n\\]\n\nNow, convert 0.5 to a fraction with a denominator of 22:\n\n\\[\n0.5 = \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1 \\times 11}{2 \\times 11} = \\frac{11}{22}\n\\]\n\nNow, add the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time away} = \\frac{15}{22} + \\frac{18}{22} + \\frac{11}{22} = \\frac{15 + 18 + 11}{22} = \\frac{44}{22} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Kim spent away from home is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
        "To determine how long Kim spent away from home, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each part step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the distance of the detour:**\n   Kim drives 30 miles to her friend's house. On the way back, she has to take a detour that is 20% longer than the original 30 miles.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Detour distance} = 30 \\text{ miles} + 0.20 \\times 30 \\text{ miles} = 30 \\text{ miles} + 6 \\text{ miles} = 36 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total driving distance:**\n   The total distance Kim drives is the sum of the distance to her friend's house and the distance back with the detour.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total driving distance} = 30 \\text{ miles} + 36 \\text{ miles} = 66 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total driving time:**\n   Kim drives at a speed of 44 mph. The total driving time is the total driving distance divided by her driving speed.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total driving time} = \\frac{66 \\text{ miles}}{44 \\text{ mph}} = 1.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total time spent away from home:**\n   The total time Kim spends away from home is the sum of the total driving time and the time she spends at her friend's house.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time away from home} = 1.5 \\text{ hours} + 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Kim spent away from home is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) hours."
