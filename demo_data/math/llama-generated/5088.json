        "To determine the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by each grade and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we find out how many trees the 5th graders planted. According to the problem, the 5th graders planted twice as many trees as the 4th graders. Since the 4th graders planted 30 trees, we calculate:\n\\[\n2 \\times 30 = 60\n\\]\nSo, the 5th graders planted 60 trees.\n\nNext, we determine how many trees the 6th graders planted. The problem states that the 6th graders planted 30 fewer than thrice the number of trees planted by the 5th graders. Since the 5th graders planted 60 trees, we calculate:\n\\[\n3 \\times 60 - 30 = 180 - 30 = 150\n\\]\nSo, the 6th graders planted 150 trees.\n\nNow, we sum the number of trees planted by all three grades:\n\\[\n30 + 60 + 150 = 240\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of trees planted by the students is \\boxed{240}.",
