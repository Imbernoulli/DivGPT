        "To determine Sarah's age, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.\n\n1. Determine Ana's current age.\n   Ana will be 15 in 3 years, so her current age is:\n   \\[\n   15 - 3 = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine Billy's current age.\n   Billy is half of Ana's age, so his current age is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. Determine Mark's current age.\n   Mark is four years older than Billy, so his current age is:\n   \\[\n   6 + 4 = 10\n   \\]\n\n4. Determine Sarah's current age.\n   Sarah's age is equal to three times Mark's age minus 4, so her current age is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 10 - 4 = 30 - 4 = 26\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Sarah is \\(\\boxed{26}\\) years old.",
        "To determine Sarah's age, we need to follow a series of logical steps based on the information given. Let's start by finding out Ana's current age.\n\nAna will be 15 in 3 years. Therefore, her current age is:\n\\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Billy is half of Ana's age. So, Billy's current age is:\n\\[ \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\]\n\nMark is four years older than Billy. Therefore, Mark's current age is:\n\\[ 6 + 4 = 10 \\]\n\nSarah's age is three times Mark's age minus 4. So, Sarah's current age is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 - 4 = 30 - 4 = 26 \\]\n\nThus, Sarah is \\(\\boxed{26}\\) years old.",
        "To find Sarah's age, we need to determine the ages of Mark, Billy, and Ana step by step.\n\nFirst, we find Ana's current age. Since Ana will be 15 in 3 years, we subtract 3 from 15:\n\\[\n15 - 3 = 12\n\\]\nSo, Ana is currently 12 years old.\n\nNext, we determine Billy's age. Billy is half of Ana's age:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\nSo, Billy is currently 6 years old.\n\nThen, we find Mark's age. Mark is four years older than Billy:\n\\[\n6 + 4 = 10\n\\]\nSo, Mark is currently 10 years old.\n\nFinally, we find Sarah's age. Sarah's age is equal to three times Mark's age minus 4:\n\\[\n3 \\times 10 - 4 = 30 - 4 = 26\n\\]\nSo, Sarah is currently \\boxed{26} years old.",
