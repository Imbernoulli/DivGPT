She sold a quarter of her 24 action figures:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 24 = 6\n\\]\nSo, Angela sold 6 action figures. This means she has:\n\\[\n24 - 6 = 18\n\\]\naction figures left after the sale.\n\nNext, Angela gave one-third of the remaining 18 action figures to her daughter. So, we calculate one-third of 18:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 18 = 6\n\\]\nSo, Angela gave 6 action figures to her daughter. This means she has:\n\\[\n18 - 6 = 12\n\\]\naction figures left after giving some to her daughter.\n\nTherefore, the number of action figures Angela has left is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
