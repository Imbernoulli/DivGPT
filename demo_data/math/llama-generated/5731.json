        "To determine how much Josh paid for the string cheese, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pieces of string cheese Josh bought.\n2. Determine the total cost in cents.\n3. Convert the total cost from cents to dollars.\n\nFirst, we find the total number of pieces of string cheese. Since each pack contains 20 pieces and Josh bought 3 packs, we multiply:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ packs} \\times 20 \\text{ pieces per pack} = 60 \\text{ pieces} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost in cents. Since each piece of string cheese costs 10 cents, we multiply:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ pieces} \\times 10 \\text{ cents per piece} = 600 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we divide:\n\\[ 600 \\text{ cents} \\div 100 = 6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Josh paid \\(\\boxed{6}\\) dollars.",
