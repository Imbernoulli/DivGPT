        "To determine how many more kilograms can still be loaded into the truck, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total mass of the lemons that are already loaded onto the truck.\n2. Subtract the total mass of the lemons from the maximum load capacity of the truck to find out how many more kilograms can still be loaded.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total mass of the lemons. There are 100 bags of lemons, and each bag weighs 8 kilograms. So, the total mass is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ bags} \\times 8 \\text{ kg/bag} = 800 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total mass of the lemons from the maximum load capacity of the truck. The maximum load capacity of the truck is 900 kilograms. So, the remaining capacity is:\n\\[ 900 \\text{ kg} - 800 \\text{ kg} = 100 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of more kilograms that can still be loaded into the truck is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
