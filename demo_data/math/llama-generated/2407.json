        "To determine the total number of fish that Tall Tuna and Jerk Tuna have together, we start by finding out how many fish Tall Tuna has. According to the problem, Tall Tuna has twice as many fish as Jerk Tuna. Since Jerk Tuna has 144 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Tall Tuna has by multiplying 144 by 2:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 144 = 288\n\\]\n\nSo, Tall Tuna has 288 fish. Next, we need to find the total number of fish that both Tall Tuna and Jerk Tuna have together. We do this by adding the number of fish Tall Tuna has to the number of fish Jerk Tuna has:\n\n\\[\n288 + 144 = 432\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of fish that Tall Tuna and Jerk Tuna have together is \\boxed{432}.",

Add the number of fish Tall Tuna has to the number of fish Jerk Tuna has.\n\nLet's start with the information given:\n- Jerk Tuna has 144 fish.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of fish Tall Tuna has:\n- Since Tall Tuna has twice as many fish as Jerk Tuna, we multiply the number of fish Jerk Tuna has by 2.\n\\[ 144 \\times 2 = 288 \\]\nSo, Tall Tuna has 288 fish.\n\nNow, we add the number of fish Tall Tuna has to the number of fish Jerk Tuna has to find the total number of fish they have together:\n\\[ 144 + 288 = 432 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of fish that Tall Tuna and Jerk Tuna have together is \\(\\boxed{432}\\).",
