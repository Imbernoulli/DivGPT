Divide the total capacity of the sewers by the daily runoff to find the number of days the sewers can handle.\n\nLet's go through these steps in detail:\n\n1. The sewers can handle 240,000 gallons of runoff.\n2. Each hour of rain produces 1,000 gallons of runoff.\n3. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the amount of runoff produced per day is:\n   \\[\n   1000 \\text{ gallons/hour} \\times 24 \\text{ hours/day} = 24,000 \\text{ gallons/day}\n   \\]\n4.
