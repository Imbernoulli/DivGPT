Use Patty's time to find out how long it takes Rachel to paint the house.\n\nFirst, we know that Matt can paint the house in 12 hours. Patty can paint the house in one third the time it takes Matt. Therefore, we calculate Patty's time as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Patty's time} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Rachel can paint the house in 5 more than double the amount of hours as Patty. Therefore, we calculate Rachel's time as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Rachel's time} = 2 \\times \\text{Patty's time} + 5 = 2 \\times 4 + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take Rachel \\boxed{13} hours to paint the house.",
