        "To determine the potential revenue lost by the \"Surprise\" shop over 6 years due to being closed during the Christmas holidays, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of days the shop is closed each year.\n2. Determine the potential revenue lost per day.\n3. Calculate the total potential revenue lost in one year.\n4. Multiply the annual potential revenue loss by the number of years.\n\nFirst, we know that the shop is closed for 3 days each year. The potential revenue lost per day is $5,000. Therefore, the total potential revenue lost in one year is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ days/year} \\times 5,000 \\text{ dollars/day} = 15,000 \\text{ dollars/year} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much potential revenue the shop loses over 6 years.
