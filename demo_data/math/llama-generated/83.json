        "To determine the total number of members in the Math club, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of female members.\n2. Use the given ratio to find the number of male members.\n3. Add the number of male members and female members to get the total number of members.\n\nWe know from the problem statement that there are 6 female members. According to the problem, there are two times as many males as females. Therefore, we can calculate the number of male members as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of male members} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of female members} = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of male members and female members to find the total number of members in the Math club:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of members} = \\text{Number of female members} + \\text{Number of male members} = 6 + 12 = 18\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of members in the Math club is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
