She decided to raise some money among the guests she invited, to buy Marta a gift. Every participant gave Samanta $5 for this purpose and she herself put in $10.

        "To determine the price of the gift, we start by calculating the total amount of money collected by Samanta. Samanta invited 12 guests, and each guest contributed $5. Therefore, the total contribution from the guests is:\n\n\\[ 12 \\times 5 = 60 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSamanta also contributed $10. So, the total amount of money collected is:\n\n\\[ 60 + 10 = 70 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAfter purchasing the gift, there was $15 leftover. Therefore, the price of the gift is the total amount of money collected minus the leftover money:\n\n\\[ 70 - 15 = 55 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the price of the gift is \\(\\boxed{55}\\).",
        "To determine the price of the gift, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected and then subtract the leftover amount. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money collected from the guests.\n   - Each guest gave $5.\n   - There were 12 guests.\n   - Therefore, the total amount of money from the guests is \\( 12 \\times 5 = 60 \\) dollars.\n\n2. Add the amount of money Samanta put in.\n   - Samanta put in $10.\n   - Therefore, the total amount of money collected is \\( 60 + 10 = 70 \\) dollars.\n\n3. Subtract the leftover amount from the total amount collected to find the price of the gift.\n   - There was $15 leftover.\n   - Therefore, the price of the gift is \\( 70 - 15 = 55 \\) dollars.\n\nSo, the price of the gift is \\(\\boxed{55}\\)."
