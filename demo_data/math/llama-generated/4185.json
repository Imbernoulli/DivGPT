        "To determine in how many years Agnes will be twice as old as Jane, we start by defining the variable \\( x \\) as the number of years from now.

        "To determine in how many years Agnes will be twice as old as Jane, we start by defining the variable \\( x \\) as the number of years from now. In \\( x \\) years, Agnes's age will be \\( 25 + x \\) and Jane's age will be \\( 6 + x \\). According to the problem, at that time, Agnes's age will be twice Jane's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\n\\[ 25 + x = 2(6 + x) \\]\n\nNext, we expand the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 25 + x = 12 + 2x \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we subtract \\( x \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 25 = 12 + x \\]\n\nThen, we subtract 12 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 13 = x \\]\n\nSo, in 13 years, Agnes will be twice as old as Jane. To verify, we check their ages in 13 years. Agnes's age will be \\( 25 + 13 = 38 \\) and Jane's age will be \\( 6 + 13 = 19 \\).
