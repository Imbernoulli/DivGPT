        "To determine the total amount Juan spent on buying t-shirts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of each type of t-shirt.\n2. Determine the number of men and women in each sector.\n3. Calculate the total cost for each sector.\n4. Sum the costs of both sectors.\n\nFirst, let's identify the cost of each type of t-shirt:\n- The cost of a white men's t-shirt is $20.\n- The cost of a black men's t-shirt is $18.\n- The cost of a white women's t-shirt is $20 - $5 = $15.\n- The cost of a black women's t-shirt is $18 - $5 = $13.\n\nNext, we determine the number of men and women in each sector. Since the company has 40 employees and the number of men and women in each sector is the same, we have:\n- Total number of employees = 40.\n- Number of employees per sector = 40 / 2 = 20.\n- Number of men per sector = 20 / 2 = 10.\n- Number of women per sector = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for each sector:\n- For the white sector:\n  - Cost of white men's t-shirts = 10 * $20 = $200.\n  - Cost of white women's t-shirts = 10 * $15 = $150.\n  - Total cost for the white sector = $200 + $150 = $350.\n- For the black sector:\n  - Cost of black men's t-shirts = 10 * $18 = $180.\n  - Cost of black women's t-shirts = 10 * $13 = $130.\n  - Total cost for the black sector = $180 + $130 = $310.\n\nFinally, we sum the costs of both sectors to get the total amount spent:\n- Total cost = $350 + $310 = $660.\n\nThus, the total amount Juan spent on buying t-shirts is \\(\\boxed{660}\\).",
        "To determine the total amount Juan spent on buying t-shirts, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we identify the cost of each type of t-shirt:\n- The cost of a white men's t-shirt is $20.\n- The cost of a black men's t-shirt is $18.\n- The cost of a white women's t-shirt is $5 cheaper than a white men's t-shirt, so it is $20 - $5 = $15.\n- The cost of a black women's t-shirt is $5 cheaper than a black men's t-shirt, so it is $18 - $5 = $13.\n\nNext, we determine the number of men and women in each sector. Since the company has 40 employees and the number of men and women is the same in each sector, we have:\n- Total number of employees = 40\n- Number of employees per sector = 40 / 2 = 20\n- Number of men per sector = 20 / 2 = 10\n- Number of women per sector = 20 / 2 = 10\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost for each sector:\n- For the white sector:\n  - Cost of white men's t-shirts = 10 * $20 = $200\n  - Cost of white women's t-shirts = 10 * $15 = $150\n  - Total cost for the white sector = $200 + $150 = $350\n\n- For the black sector:\n  - Cost of black men's t-shirts = 10 * $18 = $180\n  - Cost of black women's t-shirts = 10 * $13 = $130\n  - Total cost for the black sector = $180 + $130 = $310\n\nFinally, we add the total costs for both sectors to find the overall total cost:\n- Total cost = $350 + $310 = $660\n\nThus, the total amount Juan spent on buying t-shirts is \\(\\boxed{660}\\).",

Since the company has 40 employees and the number of men and women is the same in each sector, we can calculate the number of employees in each sector:\n- Total number of employees = 40.\n- Number of employees per sector = 40 / 2 = 20.\n- Since each sector has the same number of men and women, the number of men per sector = 20 / 2 = 10, and the number of women per sector = 20 / 2 = 10.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost for each sector:\n- For the white t-shirt sector:\n  - Cost of white men's t-shirts = 10 * $20 = $200.\n  - Cost of white women's t-shirts = 10 * $15 = $150.\n  - Total cost for the white t-shirt sector = $200 + $150 = $350.\n- For the black t-shirt sector:\n  - Cost of black men's t-shirts = 10 * $18 = $180.\n  - Cost of black women's t-shirts = 10 * $13 = $130.\n  - Total cost for the black t-shirt sector = $180 + $130 = $310.\n\nFinally, we sum the costs for both sectors to find the total amount spent:\n- Total cost = $350 + $310 = $660.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Juan spent on buying t-shirts is \\boxed{660}.",
