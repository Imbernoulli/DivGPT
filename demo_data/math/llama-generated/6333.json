Students normally get 20 minutes for recess. He told the students that every A got them 2 extra minutes of recess. Every B got them one extra minute. Every C got them zero extra minutes, but every D got them 1 less minute. When report cards came out there were 10 As, 12 Bs, 14Cs, and 5Ds. In total, how much recess would the students get that day?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total amount of recess the students would get on report card day, we need to calculate the extra recess earned from each grade and then add it to the normal recess time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the extra recess earned from each grade:\n- For every A, students get 2 extra minutes. Since there are 10 As, the extra recess from As is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 2 = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n- For every B, students get 1 extra minute. Since there are 12 Bs, the extra recess from Bs is:\n  \\[\n  12 \\times 1 = 12 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n- For every C, students get 0 extra minutes. Since there are 14 Cs, the extra recess from Cs is:\n  \\[\n  14 \\times 0 = 0 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n- For every D, students get 1 less minute. Since there are 5 Ds, the extra recess from Ds is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times (-1) = -5 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we sum the extra recess from all the grades:\n\\[\n20 + 12 + 0 - 5 = 27 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add this total extra recess to the normal recess time of 20 minutes:\n\\[\n20 + 27 = 47 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of recess the students would get that day is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{47}\n\\]",
