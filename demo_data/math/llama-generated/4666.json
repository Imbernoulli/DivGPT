The ratio given is 2:1:3, which means for every 2 parts Sandra gets, Amy gets 1 part, and Ruth gets 3 parts. We know that Amy received $50, so we can use this information to find the value of one part of the ratio.\n\nSince Amy's share corresponds to 1 part of the ratio, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ part} = \\$50 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much Sandra received.
