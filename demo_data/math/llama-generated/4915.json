Melissa made 4 times as many muffins as Sasha. Since Sasha made 30 muffins, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 30 = 120\n   \\]\n   So, Melissa made 120 muffins.\n\n2. The total number of muffins made by Sasha and Melissa is:\n   \\[\n   30 + 120 = 150\n   \\]\n\n3. Tiffany made half of the total number of muffins made by Sasha and Melissa. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{150}{2} = 75\n   \\]\n   So, Tiffany made 75 muffins.\n\n4. The total number of muffins made by Sasha, Melissa, and Tiffany is:\n   \\[\n   30 + 120 + 75 = 225\n   \\]\n\n5. If one muffin sold for $4, the total amount of money contributed is:\n   \\[\n   225 \\times 4 = 900\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money contributed to the fundraiser is \\(\\boxed{900}\\).",
