He had a 10% off coupon that he could use on his entire purchase after any other discounts.  Paul bought 4 dress shirts at $15.00 apiece, 2 pairs of pants that each cost $40.00.  He found a suit for $150.00 and 2 sweaters for $30.00 each.  When he got to the register, the clerk told him that the store was offering 20% off of everything in the store.  After the discounts and the coupon, how much did Paul spend on his new clothes?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
