Johny turned East and traveled for 20 more miles than the distance he took to travel to the South. Since he traveled South 40 miles, he traveled East \\(40 + 20 = 60\\) miles.\n3. Johny turned North and traveled twice the distance he had traveled to the East. Since he traveled East 60 miles, he traveled North \\(2 \\times 60 = 120\\) miles.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the distances he traveled:\n- South: 40 miles\n- East: 60 miles\n- North: 120 miles\n\nThe total distance his journey took is:\n\\[40 + 60 + 120 = 220\\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance Johny's journey took is \\(\\boxed{220}\\).",
        "To determine the total distance Johny traveled, we will break down his journey into segments and sum the distances for each segment.\n\n1. **Southward Travel:**\n   Johny traveled south for 40 miles.\n\n2. **Eastward Travel:**\n   Johny then turned east and traveled 20 miles more than the distance he traveled south. Since he traveled south for 40 miles, he traveled east for:\n   \\[\n   40 + 20 = 60 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Northward Travel:**\n   Johny turned north and traveled twice the distance he traveled east. Since he traveled east for 60 miles, he traveled north for:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the distances for all segments of his journey:\n\\[\n40 \\text{ miles (south)} + 60 \\text{ miles (east)} + 120 \\text{ miles (north)} = 220 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total distance Johny traveled is \\(\\boxed{220}\\) miles."
