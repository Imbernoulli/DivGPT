Norris saved $29 in September, $25 in October, and $31 in November. We can add these amounts together as follows:\n\n\\[\n29 + 25 + 31\n\\]\n\nFirst, we add $29 and $25:\n\n\\[\n29 + 25 = 54\n\\]\n\nNext, we add $54 and $31:\n\n\\[\n54 + 31 = 85\n\\]\n\nSo, Norris saved a total of $85 over the three months. Then, Hugo spent $75 on an online game. To find out how much money Norris has left, we subtract the amount Hugo spent from the total amount Norris saved:\n\n\\[\n85 - 75 = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Norris has left is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
