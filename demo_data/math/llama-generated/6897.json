        "To determine how many matches Nate has left after his camping trip, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial number of matches**: Nate starts with 70 matches.\n2. **Matches dropped in the creek**: Nate drops 10 matches in the creek.\n3. **Matches eaten by the dog**: His dog eats twice as many matches as he dropped in the creek. Therefore, the dog eats \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) matches.\n4. **Total matches lost**: The total number of matches lost is the sum of the matches dropped in the creek and the matches eaten by the dog. This is \\(10 + 20 = 30\\) matches.\n5. **Matches remaining**: To find out how many matches Nate has left, we subtract the total matches lost from the initial number of matches. This is \\(70 - 30 = 40\\).\n\nThus, the number of matches Nate has left is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",

Since he dropped 10 matches, the dog eats:\n\\[ 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of matches eaten by the dog from the remaining matches:\n\\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of matches Nate has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
        "To determine how many matches Nate has left after his camping trip, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial number of matches**: Nate starts with 70 matches.\n2. **Matches dropped in the creek**: Nate drops 10 matches in a creek.\n3. **Matches eaten by the dog**: His dog eats twice as many matches as he dropped in the creek. Therefore, the dog eats \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) matches.\n4. **Total matches lost**: The total number of matches lost is the sum of the matches dropped in the creek and the matches eaten by the dog. This is \\(10 + 20 = 30\\) matches.\n5. **Matches left**: To find out how many matches Nate has left, we subtract the total matches lost from the initial number of matches.
