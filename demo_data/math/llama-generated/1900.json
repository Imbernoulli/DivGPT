Subtract the total number of water bottles taken from the initial number of water bottles.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of water bottles Samira initially has.**\n\nSamira has four dozen water bottles. Since one dozen equals 12, we have:\n\\[ 4 \\times 12 = 48 \\]\nSo, Samira initially has 48 water bottles.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of water bottles taken by the players during the first break.**\n\nThere are 11 players on the field, and each player takes 2 bottles of water during the first break. Therefore, the total number of bottles taken during the first break is:\n\\[ 11 \\times 2 = 22 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of water bottles taken by the players at the end of the game.**\n\nThere are 11 players on the field, and each player takes 1 more bottle of water at the end of the game. Therefore, the total number of bottles taken at the end of the game is:\n\\[ 11 \\times 1 = 11 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the total number of water bottles taken from the initial number of water bottles.**\n\nThe total number of water bottles taken during the game is the sum of the bottles taken during the first break and the bottles taken at the end of the game:\n\\[ 22 + 11 = 33 \\]\nSo, the total number of water bottles taken is 33. Subtracting this from the initial number of water bottles gives:\n\\[ 48 - 33 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bottles of water remaining in Samira's box is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
