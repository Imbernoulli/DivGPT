        "To determine how many more cards Lloyd, Mark, and Michael need to collect so that they will have a total of 300 cards, we start by finding out how many cards each of them currently has.\n\nFirst, we know that Michael has 100 cards. According to the problem, Mark has 10 fewer cards than Michael. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cards Mark has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Mark's cards} = 100 - 10 = 90\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Mark has thrice as many cards as Lloyd. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cards Lloyd has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Lloyd's cards} = \\frac{90}{3} = 30\n\\]\n\nNow, we know the current number of cards each person has:\n- Lloyd has 30 cards.\n- Mark has 90 cards.\n- Michael has 100 cards.\n\nTo find out how many cards they currently have in total, we add the number of cards each person has:\n\\[\n\\text{Total current cards} = 30 + 90 + 100 = 220\n\\]\n\nWe need the total number of cards to be 300. Therefore, we calculate the number of additional cards they need to collect as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Additional cards needed} = 300 - 220 = 80\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of additional cards they need to collect is \\boxed{80}.",

        "To determine how many more cards Lloyd, Mark, and Michael should collect so that they will have a total of 300 cards, we start by finding out how many cards each of them currently has.\n\nFirst, we know that Michael has 100 cards. According to the problem, Mark has 10 fewer cards than Michael. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cards Mark has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Mark's cards} = 100 - 10 = 90\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Mark has thrice as many cards as Lloyd. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cards Lloyd has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Lloyd's cards} = \\frac{90}{3} = 30\n\\]\n\nNow, we know the number of cards each person currently has:\n- Lloyd: 30 cards\n- Mark: 90 cards\n- Michael: 100 cards\n\nWe can find the total number of cards they currently have by adding these amounts together:\n\\[\n\\text{Total current cards} = 30 + 90 + 100 = 220\n\\]\n\nWe want the total number of cards to be 300. Therefore, we need to determine how many more cards they need to collect:\n\\[\n\\text{Additional cards needed} = 300 - 220 = 80\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of additional cards they should collect is \\boxed{80}.",
