        "To determine how many stuffed bears Eden has now, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of bears Daragh has left after taking out her favorite 8 bears:**\n   Daragh started with 20 bears and took out 8, so she has:\n   \\[\n   20 - 8 = 12 \\text{ bears left}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide the remaining bears equally among her 3 sisters:**\n   Daragh has 12 bears left, and she divides them equally among her 3 sisters.
