        "To determine how many more married people there are than children at the birthday party, we start by calculating the number of married people, single people, and children.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of married people:\n\\[ 30\\% \\text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \\times 1000 = 300. \\]\nSo, there are 300 married people.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of single people:\n\\[ 50\\% \\text{ of } 1000 = 0.50 \\times 1000 = 500. \\]\nSo, there are 500 single people.\n\nNow, we calculate the number of children.

Since 30% of the guests are married, we can find this number by multiplying the total number of guests by 30%:\n\n\\[\n0.30 \\times 1000 = 300\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 300 married guests.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of single guests. Since 50% of the guests are single, we can find this number by multiplying the total number of guests by 50%:\n\n\\[\n0.50 \\times 1000 = 500\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 500 single guests.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of children. Since the rest of the guests are children, we can find this number by subtracting the number of married and single guests from the total number of guests:\n\n\\[\n1000 - 300 - 500 = 200\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 200 children.\n\nFinally, let's find the difference between the number of married guests and the number of children:\n\n\\[\n300 - 200 = 100\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are \\(\\boxed{100}\\) more married people than children.",
