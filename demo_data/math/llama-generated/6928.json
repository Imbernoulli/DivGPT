        "To determine Tabitha's current age, we need to understand the pattern of how she adds hair colors. We know that she started adding hair colors when she was 15 years old, and that was the year she added her second hair color. This means she added her first hair color when she was 14 years old.\n\nSince she adds one new hair color each year, the number of hair colors she has each year can be calculated by adding 1 to the number of years since she started adding hair colors. If she will have 8 different hair colors in three years, we can work backwards to find out how many hair colors she has now.\n\nIf in three years she will have 8 hair colors, then currently she has:\n\\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \\text{ hair colors} \\]\n\nSince she started with 2 hair colors at age 15, the number of years since she started adding hair colors is:\n\\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nTherefore, her current age is:\n\\[ 15 + 3 = 18 \\]\n\nSo, Tabitha is currently \\(\\boxed{18}\\) years old.",
        "To determine Tabitha's current age, we need to understand the pattern of how she adds new colors to her hair. According to the problem, Tabitha started adding a new color each year when she was 15 years old, which was the year she added her second hair color.

Since she started adding hair colors when she was 15 years old and has been adding one new color each year since then, the number of hair colors she currently has is \\( x - 13 \\) (because she was 13 years old when she started adding hair colors).\n\nIn three years, Tabitha will be \\( x + 3 \\) years old, and she will have added three more hair colors since she started. Therefore, the number of hair colors she will have in three years is \\( (x - 13) + 3 = x - 10 \\). According to the problem, in three years she will have 8 different colors in her hair. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ x - 10 = 8 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we add 10 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ x = 8 + 10 \\]\n\\[ x = 18 \\]\n\nTherefore, Tabitha is currently \\(\\boxed{18}\\) years old.",

        "To determine Tabitha's current age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many colors Tabitha adding each year.\n2. Determine how many colors Tabitha currently has.\n3. Calculate Tabitha's current age based on the information given.\n\nFirst, we know that Tabitha started adding a new color to her hair when she was 15 years old, and that was the year she added her second hair color. This means she added her first hair color before she was 15 years old. Therefore, she has been adding one new color each year since she was 14 years old.\n\nNext, we know that in three years, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair. If she will have 8 colors in three years, then she currently has:\n\\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \\]\ncolors.\n\nSince she started with her second hair color at age 15, and she has been adding one new color each year since then, the number of years she has been adding colors is:\n\\[ 5 - 1 = 4 \\]\nyears (because she already had one color at age 14).\n\nTherefore, her current age is:\n\\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \\]\n\nSo, Tabitha is currently \\(\\boxed{18}\\) years old.",
        "To determine Tabitha's current age, we need to analyze the information given step by step.\n\n1. Tabitha started adding hair colors when she was 15 years old, and at that time, she had already added her second hair color. This means she added her first hair color before she was 15 years old.\n\n2. Each year, Tabitha adds a new hair color. Therefore, if she will have 8 different colors in three years, we can calculate the number of colors she currently has by subtracting 3 from 8:\n   \\[\n   8 - 3 = 5\n   \\]\n   So, Tabitha currently has 5 different colors in her hair.\n\n3. Since Tabitha started with 2 hair colors at age 15, the number of years she has been adding hair colors is:\n   \\[\n   5 - 2 = 3\n   \\]\n   This means she has been adding hair colors for 3 years.\n\n4. To find Tabitha's current age, we add the number of years she has been adding hair colors to her age when she started:\n   \\[\n   15 + 3 = 18\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Tabitha is currently \\boxed{18} years old.",

Since she started with her second hair color at age 15, we can calculate the total number of colors she will have in three years.\n4. If she has \\( x \\) colors currently, then in three years she will have \\( x + 3 \\) colors. According to the problem, in three years she will have 8 colors. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   x + 3 = 8\n   \\]\n5. Solving for \\( x \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   x = 8 - 3 = 5\n   \\]\n   So, Tabitha currently has 5 different colors in her hair.\n6. Since she started with her second hair color at age 15, she must have added 3 more colors to her current total of 2 colors. Therefore, she has added 3 colors in the time since she was 15 years old. This means she is currently \\( 15 + 3 = 18 \\) years old.\n\nThus, Tabitha's current age is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

In three years, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair.\n\nLet's denote Tabitha's current age as \\( x \\). Since she started adding hair colors when she was 15, the number of years she has been adding colors is \\( x - 15 \\). Therefore, the number of colors she currently has in her hair is \\( 2 + (x - 15) = x - 13 \\).\n\nIn three years, her age will be \\( x + 3 \\), and the number of colors she will have in her hair will be \\( x - 13 + 3 = x - 10 \\). According to the problem, in three years she will have 8 different colors in her hair, so we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ x - 10 = 8 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ x = 8 + 10 \\]\n\\[ x = 18 \\]\n\nThus, Tabitha's current age is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

In three years, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of hair colors Tabitha will have in three years. If she will have 8 hair colors in three years, we need to find out how many hair colors she has now. Let \\( x \\) be the number of hair colors she has now. Since she adds one new hair color each year, in three years she will add \\( 3 \\) hair colors.

In three years, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair.\n\nLet's denote Tabitha's current age as \\( x \\). Since she started adding hair colors at age 15 and added her second color that year, she has been adding one new color each year since then. Therefore, the number of colors she has currently is \\( (x - 15) + 2 \\). This is because she started with 2 colors and has added one new color each year since she was 15.\n\nIn three years, her age will be \\( x + 3 \\), and the number of colors she will have will be \\( ((x + 3) - 15) + 2 \\). According to the problem, this number is 8.

        "To determine Tabitha's current age, let's analyze the information given step by step.\n\n1. Tabitha started adding hair colors when she was 15 years old. At that time, she had already added her second hair color, so she had 2 colors in her hair.\n2. Each year, Tabitha adds a new color to her hair. Therefore, if we let \\( x \\) be her current age, the number of colors she has in her hair currently is \\( 2 + (x - 15) = x - 13 \\). This is because she had 2 colors when she was 15, and she adds one color each year since then.\n3. In three years, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair. So, in three years, her age will be \\( x + 3 \\), and the number of colors she will have will be \\( x - 13 + 3 = x - 10 \\). According to the problem, this number is 8.\n4. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:\n   \\[\n   x - 10 = 8\n   \\]\n5. To find \\( x \\), we add 10 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   x = 8 + 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 18\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Tabitha is currently \\(\\boxed{18}\\) years old.",
        "To determine Tabitha's current age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of colors Tabitha added each year:**\n   - Tabitha started adding colors when she was 15 years old.\n   - She added her second color that year.\n   - Every subsequent year, she adds one new color.\n\n2. **Determine how many colors Tabitha will have in three years:**\n   - According to the problem, in three years, Tabitha will have 8 different colors.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of colors Tabitha currently has:**\n   - Since she will have 8 colors in three years, we subtract 3 from 8:\n     \\[\n     8 - 3 = 5\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, Tabitha currently has 5 different colors in her hair.\n\n4. **Determine the number of years since she started adding colors:**\n   - Tabitha started with 2 colors and now has 5 colors.\n   - The number of years she has been adding colors is:\n     \\[\n     5 - 2 = 3\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Tabitha's current age:**\n   - She started adding colors when she was 15 years old.\n   - She has been adding colors for 3 years.\n   - Therefore, her current age is:\n     \\[\n     15 + 3 = 18\n     \\]\n\nThus, Tabitha is currently \\(\\boxed{18}\\) years old.",

Therefore, if she will have 8 different colors in three years, we can calculate the number of colors she has now by subtracting 3 from 8:\n   \\[\n   8 - 3 = 5\n   \\]\n   So, Tabitha currently has 5 different colors in her hair.\n3. Since she started with 2 colors at age 15 and has added one new color each year, the number of years she has been adding colors is:\n   \\[\n   5 - 2 = 3\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Tabitha is currently:\n   \\[\n   15 + 3 = 18\n   \\]\n\nSo, Tabitha's current age is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

Tabitha started adding a new hair color each year when she was 15 years old, which was the year she added her second hair color.\n2. In three years, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair.\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Since Tabitha started adding hair colors when she was 15 years old and that was the year she added her second hair color, it means she added her first hair color before she was 15 years old. However, the exact age when she added her first hair color is not relevant to solving the problem.\n\n2. currently, we know that in three years, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair. Therefore, currently, she has \\(8 - 3 = 5\\) different colors in her hair. Since she adds one new hair color each year, she must have added her fifth hair color this year.\n\n3. Since she added her second hair color when she was 15 years old, and she has added a new hair color each year since then, she must be \\(15 + (5 - 2) = 15 + 3 = 18\\) years old now.\n\nThus, Tabitha's current age is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

In three years, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in her hair.\n\nLet's calculate how many colors Tabitha has now. Since she will have 8 colors in three years, we subtract 3 from 8:\n\\[\n8 - 3 = 5\n\\]\nSo, Tabitha currently has 5 different colors in her hair.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many years it took for Tabitha to go from having 2 colors to having 5 colors. Since she adds one new color each year, we subtract the number of colors she started with from the number of colors she has now:\n\\[\n5 - 2 = 3\n\\]\nSo, it took Tabitha 3 years to add 3 new colors.\n\nSince Tabitha started adding colors when she was 15 years old, we add these 3 years to her age at that time:\n\\[\n15 + 3 = 18\n\\]\nTherefore, Tabitha is currently \\boxed{18} years old.",
