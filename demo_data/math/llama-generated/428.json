        "To determine the total number of balls in the box, we need to calculate the number of each color of ball and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Blue Balls:**\n   The box contains 6 blue balls.\n\n2. **Red Balls:**\n   The box contains 4 red balls.\n\n3. **Green Balls:**\n   The box contains 3 times as many green balls as blue balls.

        "To determine the total number of balls in the box, we need to calculate the number of each color of ball and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Blue Balls:**\n   The box contains 6 blue balls.\n\n2. **Red Balls:**\n   The box contains 4 red balls.\n\n3. **Green Balls:**\n   The number of green balls is 3 times the number of blue balls. Since there are 6 blue balls:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 6 = 18\n   \\]\n   Therefore, there are 18 green balls.\n\n4. **Yellow Balls:**\n   The number of yellow balls is twice the number of red balls. Since there are 4 red balls:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4 = 8\n   \\]\n   Therefore, there are 8 yellow balls.\n\nNext, we sum the number of balls of each color:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ (blue)} + 4 \\text{ (red)} + 18 \\text{ (green)} + 8 \\text{ (yellow)}\n\\]\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n6 + 4 = 10\n\\]\n\\[\n10 + 18 = 28\n\\]\n\\[\n28 + 8 = 36\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of balls in the box is \\boxed{36}."
