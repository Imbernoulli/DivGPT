        "To determine the total number of students with average height, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of short students.\n2. Subtract the number of short students and tall students from the total number of students to find the number of students with average height.\n\nFirst, we know that the number of short students is \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the total number of students. The total number of students in the class is 400. Therefore, we can calculate the number of short students as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of short students} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 400 = \\frac{2 \\times 400}{5} = \\frac{800}{5} = 160\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that there are 90 tall students. To find the number of students with average height, we subtract the number of short students and tall students from the total number of students:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students with average height} = 400 - \\text{Number of short students} - \\text{Number of tall students} = 400 - 160 - 90 = 150\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of students with average height is \\(\\boxed{150}\\).",
