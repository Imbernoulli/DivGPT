        "To determine how many rolls John bought, we start by calculating how many dozens of rolls he purchased. Since each dozen costs 5 dollars and John spent 15 dollars, we divide 15 by 5:\n\n\\[ 15 \\div 5 = 3 \\]\n\nThis means John bought 3 dozens of rolls. Since each dozen contains 12 rolls, we multiply the number of dozens by 12 to find the total number of rolls:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, John bought \\(\\boxed{36}\\) rolls.",
        "To determine how many rolls John got, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how many dozens of rolls John bought.\n2. Convert the number of dozens into individual rolls.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of dozens of rolls John bought. Since each dozen costs 5 dollars and John spent 15 dollars, we divide 15 by 5:\n\\[\n15 \\div 5 = 3\n\\]\nSo, John bought 3 dozens of rolls.\n\nNext, we convert the number of dozens into individual rolls.

        "To determine how many rolls John bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the cost per roll:**\n   - The bakery sells rolls for $5 for a dozen.\n   - A dozen is 12 rolls.\n   - Therefore, the cost per roll is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5 \\text{ dollars}}{12 \\text{ rolls}} = \\frac{5}{12} \\text{ dollars per roll}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of rolls John bought:**\n   - John spent $15.\n   - We need to find out how many rolls he can buy with $15.\n   - First, determine how many dozens he can buy with $15:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{15 \\text{ dollars}}{5 \\text{ dollars per dozen}} = 3 \\text{ dozens}\n     \\]\n   - Since each dozen is 12 rolls, the total number of rolls is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ dozens} \\times 12 \\text{ rolls per dozen} = 36 \\text{ rolls}\n     \\]\n\nThus, John bought \\(\\boxed{36}\\) rolls.",
        "To determine how many rolls John got, we start by finding out how many dozens of rolls he bought. Since each dozen costs $5, we can calculate the number of dozens by dividing the total amount of money John spent by the cost per dozen.\n\nThe total amount John spent is $15, and the cost per dozen is $5. So, we perform the division:\n\\[\n15 \\div 5 = 3\n\\]\nThis means John bought 3 dozens of rolls.
