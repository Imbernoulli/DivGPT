        "To determine Luna's total monthly budget to pay for her house rental, food, and phone bill, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( R \\) be Luna's house rental budget.\n   - Let \\( F \\) be Luna's food budget.\n   - Let \\( P \\) be Luna's phone bill budget.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**\n   - Luna's food budget is 60% of her house rental budget: \n     \\[\n     F = 0.6R\n     \\]\n   - Luna's phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget:\n     \\[\n     P = 0.1F\n     \\]\n   - The total budget of house rental and food budget is $240:\n     \\[\n     R + F = 240\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute \\( F \\) in the Total Budget Equation:**\n   Substitute \\( F = 0.6R \\) into the equation \\( R + F = 240 \\):\n   \\[\n   R + 0.6R = 240\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine Like Terms:**\n   \\[\n   1.6R = 240\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( R \\):**\n   \\[\n   R = \\frac{240}{1.6} = 150\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find \\( F \\) Using \\( F = 0.6R \\):**\n   \\[\n   F = 0.6 \\times 150 = 90\n   \\]\n\n7. **Find \\( P \\) Using \\( P = 0.1F \\):**\n   \\[\n   P = 0.1 \\times 90 = 9\n   \\]\n\n8. **Calculate the Total Monthly Budget:**\n   Add the house rental budget, food budget, and phone bill budget:\n   \\[\n   R + F + P = 150 + 90 + 9 = 249\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Luna's total monthly budget to pay all those expenses is \\(\\boxed{249}\\).",

According to the problem, Luna's food budget is equal to 60% of her house rental budget, so we can write:\n\n\\[ F = 0.6R \\]\n\nWe are also given that the total budget of house rental and food budget is $240. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ R + F = 240 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\( F \\) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\n\\[ R + 0.6R = 240 \\]\n\\[ 1.6R = 240 \\]\n\nTo find \\( R \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.6:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{240}{1.6} = 150 \\]\n\nNow that we know \\( R = 150 \\), we can find \\( F \\) using the equation \\( F = 0.6R \\):\n\n\\[ F = 0.6 \\times 150 = 90 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Luna's phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget, so we can write:\n\n\\[ \\text{Phone bill budget} = 0.1F = 0.1 \\times 90 = 9 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find Luna's total monthly budget to pay all these expenses. This is the sum of her house rental budget, food budget, and phone bill budget:\n\n\\[ R + F + \\text{Phone bill budget} = 150 + 90 + 9 = 249 \\]\n\nTherefore, Luna's total monthly budget to pay all these expenses is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{249} \\]",
