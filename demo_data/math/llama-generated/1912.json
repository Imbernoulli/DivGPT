Since Jordan read 120 novels, we can find the number of novels Alexandre read by multiplying 120 by \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\):\n\n\\[\n120 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = 12\n\\]\n\nSo, Alexandre read 12 novels.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more novels Jordan read than Alexandre. We do this by subtracting the number of novels Alexandre read from the number of novels Jordan read:\n\n\\[\n120 - 12 = 108\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jordan read \\(\\boxed{108}\\) more novels than Alexandre.",
