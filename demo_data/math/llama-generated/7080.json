To find out how many ants Duke sees, we divide 4 by 2:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\]\nSo, Duke sees 2 ants.\n\nNow, we add the number of ants seen by each child to find the total number of ants:\n\\[ 4 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of ants found by the four children is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of ants found by the four children, we need to calculate the number of ants each child sees and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we know that Abe finds 4 ants. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Abe's ants} = 4 \\]\n\nNext, Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe. To find out how many ants Beth sees, we calculate 50% of 4 and add it to 4:\n\\[ \\text{Beth's ants} = 4 + 0.5 \\times 4 = 4 + 2 = 6 \\]\n\nCeCe watches twice as many ants as Abe. Therefore, we multiply the number of ants Abe sees by 2:\n\\[ \\text{CeCe's ants} = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\n\nDuke discovers half as many ants as Abe. So, we divide the number of ants Abe sees by 2:\n\\[ \\text{Duke's ants} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of ants found by all four children:\n\\[ \\text{Total ants} = \\text{Abe's ants} + \\text{Beth's ants} + \\text{CeCe's ants} + \\text{Duke's ants} = 4 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of ants found by the four children together is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]"
