        "To determine how many days it takes Marla to collect all the bottle caps she needs to buy a horse, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the value of a horse in bottle caps:**\n   - First, find the value of a horse in gallons of water: 1 horse = 80 gallons of water.\n   - Next, find the value of 3 lizards in gallons of water: 3 lizards = 5 gallons of water.\n   - Therefore, the value of 1 lizard in gallons of water is \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\) gallons.\n   - Now, find the value of a horse in lizards: \\(80 \\text{ gallons} \\div \\frac{5}{3} \\text{ gallons/lizard} = 80 \\times \\frac{3}{5} = 48 \\text{ lizards}\\).\n   - Since 1 lizard is worth 8 bottle caps, the value of a horse in bottle caps is \\(48 \\text{ lizards} \\times 8 \\text{ bottle caps/lizard} = 384 \\text{ bottle caps}\\).\n\n2. **Determine Marla's net gain of bottle caps per day:**\n   - Marla collects 20 bottle caps each day.\n   - Marla pays 4 bottle caps each night for food and shelter.\n   - Therefore, her net gain of bottle caps per day is \\(20 - 4 = 16 \\text{ bottle caps/day}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the number of days it takes Marla to collect 384 bottle caps:**\n   - Marla needs 384 bottle caps.\n   - Her net gain per day is 16 bottle caps.\n   - Therefore, the number of days it takes Marla to collect 384 bottle caps is \\(384 \\div 16 = 24\\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",

So, her net gain of bottle caps per day is:\n\\[ \\text{Net gain per day} = 20 - 4 = 16 \\text{ bottle caps} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of days required to collect the bottle caps for a horse.**\n\nTo find out how many days it takes Marla to collect 384 bottle caps, we divide the total number of bottle caps needed by her net gain per day:\n\\[ \\text{Number of days} = \\frac{384}{16} = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Marla \\(\\boxed{24}\\) days to collect all the bottle caps she needs to buy a horse.",
        "To determine how many days it takes Marla to collect all the bottle caps she needs to buy a horse, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the bottle cap value of a horse:**\n   - First, find the bottle cap value of a gallon of water.
