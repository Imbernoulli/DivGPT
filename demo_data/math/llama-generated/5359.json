He splits the class equally into 3 groups and then each of the groups goes through the museum one student at a time. If the class has 18 students in total and each student takes 4 minutes to go through the museum, then how long, in minutes, does it take each group to go through the museum?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
