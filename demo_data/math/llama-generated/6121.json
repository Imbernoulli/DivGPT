Since Harry orders 2 pizzas, the total cost of the toppings is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the toppings is $12.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the 25% tip.**\n\nThe total cost of the pizzas and toppings before the tip is:\n\\[ 28 + 12 = 40 \\]\nA 25% tip on $40 is:\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 40 = 10 \\]\nSo, the tip is $10.\n\n**Step 4: Add the tip to the total cost of the pizzas and toppings.**\n\nThe total cost of the order is:\n\\[ 40 + 10 = 50 \\]\nSo, the total cost of Harry's pizza order is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",

Since Harry orders 2 large pizzas, the cost of the pizzas is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 14 = 28\n   \\]\n\n2. Each pizza has 3 toppings, and each topping costs $2. Therefore, the cost of the toppings for one pizza is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2 = 6\n   \\]\n   Since Harry orders 2 pizzas, the total cost of the toppings is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 6 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. The total cost of the pizzas and the toppings before the tip is:\n   \\[\n   28 + 12 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Harry adds a 25% tip. To find the amount of the tip, we calculate 25% of $40:\n   \\[\n   0.25 \\times 40 = 10\n   \\]\n\n5. The total cost of the order, including the tip, is:\n   \\[\n   40 + 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Harry's pizza order is \\boxed{50}.",

Calculate the total cost of two large pizzas with toppings.\n3. Add a 25% tip to the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of one large pizza with toppings. Each large pizza costs $14 and has 3 toppings. Since each topping costs $2, the cost of the toppings is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ toppings} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per topping} = \\$6 \\]\nSo, the total cost of one large pizza with toppings is:\n\\[ \\$14 + \\$6 = \\$20 \\]\n\nNext, since Harry orders 2 large pizzas, the total cost for the two pizzas is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ pizzas} \\times \\$20 \\text{ per pizza} = \\$40 \\]\n\nFinally, we need to add a 25% tip to the total cost.

        "To determine the total cost of Harry's pizza order, we need to break down the cost step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the cost of one large pizza with toppings:\n- The base cost of one large pizza is $14.\n- Each topping costs $2, and Harry adds 3 toppings to each pizza.\n- Therefore, the cost of the toppings for one pizza is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) dollars.\n- Adding the cost of the toppings to the base cost of the pizza gives us \\(14 + 6 = 20\\) dollars for one pizza with toppings.\n\nNext, calculate the cost for two large pizzas with toppings:\n- Since each pizza with toppings costs $20, the cost for two pizzas is \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) dollars.\n\nNow, calculate the total cost including the 25% tip:\n- The tip is 25% of the cost of the two pizzas.\n- To find 25% of $40, we calculate \\(0.25 \\times 40 = 10\\) dollars.\n- Adding the tip to the cost of the two pizzas gives us \\(40 + 10 = 50\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Harry's pizza order is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
