        "To determine how long it takes Lily to type 255 words, we need to consider both her typing speed and her break schedule.\n\nFirst, calculate how many words Lily can type in one complete cycle of typing and breaks. A complete cycle is 10 minutes of typing followed by a 2-minute break, which totals 12 minutes. In 10 minutes, Lily types:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ words/minute} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} = 150 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nNext, determine how many complete cycles are needed to type 255 words. Since each cycle results in 150 words, we divide 255 by 150:\n\\[ 255 \\div 150 = 1.7 \\]\nThis means Lily needs 1 complete cycle and an additional 0.7 of a cycle to type 255 words. In 1 complete cycle, she types 150 words, so she needs to type:\n\\[ 255 - 150 = 105 \\text{ more words} \\]\nSince she types 15 words per minute, the time required to type 105 words is:\n\\[ 105 \\div 15 = 7 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, add the time for the complete cycle and the additional time to type the remaining words:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ minutes} + 7 \\text{ minutes} = 19 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes for Lily to type 255 words is:\n\\[ \\boxed{19} \\]",

Since she types 15 words per minute, in 10 minutes she types:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ words/minute} \\times 10 \\text{ minutes} = 150 \\text{ words} \\]\nSo, in one complete cycle of 12 minutes (10 minutes of work + 2 minutes of break), she types 150 words.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many complete cycles are required to type 255 words. We do this by dividing 255 by 150:\n\\[ 255 \\div 150 = 1.7 \\]\nThis means that Lily needs 1 complete cycle to type 150 words and then an additional 0.7 of a cycle to type the remaining words. Since one cycle is 12 minutes, 0.7 of a cycle is:\n\\[ 0.7 \\times 12 = 8.4 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nIn 8.4 minutes, Lily types:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ words/minute} \\times 8.4 \\text{ minutes} = 126 \\text{ words} \\]\nSo, in total, she types 150 words in the first cycle and 126 words in the additional 8.4 minutes, which adds up to:\n\\[ 150 \\text{ words} + 126 \\text{ words} = 276 \\text{ words} \\]\nSince 276 words is more than 255 words, we see that she does not need the full 8.4 minutes of the additional cycle to type exactly 255 words. Instead, she will type the remaining 105 words in less than 8.4 minutes.\n\nTo find out exactly how long it takes her to type the remaining 105 words, we divide 105 by her typing speed:\n\\[ 105 \\div 15 = 7 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nSo, she types 105 words in 7 minutes.\n\nAdding the time for the first cycle (12 minutes) and the additional time (7 minutes), we get:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ minutes} + 7 \\text{ minutes} = 19 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes for Lily to type 255 words is:\n\\[ \\boxed{19} \\]",
