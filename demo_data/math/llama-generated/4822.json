        "To determine the total number of matches James has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of boxes James has.\n2. Determine the number of matches in each box.\n3. Multiply the number of boxes by the number of matches per box.\n\nFirst, we know that James has 5 dozen boxes of matches. Since one dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of boxes as follows:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ dozen} = 5 \\times 12 = 60 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nNext, we know that each box contains 20 matches. Therefore, the total number of matches is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ boxes} \\times 20 \\text{ matches per box} = 1200 \\text{ matches} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of matches James has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1200} \\]",
