        "To determine the original price of each tire, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the 4 tires that Gargamel bought.\n2. Determine the total savings Gargamel received.\n3. Find out how much he saved on each tire.\n4. Add the savings per tire to the sale price to find the original price.\n\nFirst, calculate the total cost of the 4 tires:\n\\[\n4 \\times 75 = 300\n\\]\nSo, Gargamel spent $300 on the tires.\n\nNext, we know that Gargamel saved a total of $36. Therefore, the total amount he would have spent without the sale is:\n\\[\n300 + 36 = 336\n\\]\nSince he bought 4 tires, the original price of each tire is:\n\\[\n336 \\div 4 = 84\n\\]\nSo, the original price of each tire was \\(\\boxed{84}\\).",

        "To determine the original price of each tire, we start by calculating the total amount Gargamel spent on the tires. Since he bought 4 tires at a sale price of $75 each, we multiply the number of tires by the sale price:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 75 = 300 \\]\n\nThis means Gargamel spent $300 on the tires. We know from the problem statement that he saved a total of $36. Therefore, the total original cost of the tires is the amount he spent plus the total savings:\n\n\\[ 300 + 36 = 336 \\]\n\nSince Gargamel bought 4 tires, we find the original price of each tire by dividing the total original cost by the number of tires:\n\n\\[ 336 \\div 4 = 84 \\]\n\nThus, the original price of each tire was \\(\\boxed{84}\\).",
