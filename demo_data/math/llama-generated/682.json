        "To determine the height of the cow manure plant, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the height of the control plant.\n2. Calculate the height of the bone meal plant based on the height of the control plant.\n3. Calculate the height of the cow manure plant based on the height of the bone meal plant.\n\nThe height of the control plant is given as 36 inches.\n\nFirst, we calculate the height of the bone meal plant. The bone meal plant grows to 125% of the height of the control plant. To find 125% of 36 inches, we convert 125% to a decimal and multiply by 36:\n\\[\n125\\% = \\frac{125}{100} = 1.25\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Height of bone meal plant} = 1.25 \\times 36 = 45 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the height of the cow manure plant. The cow manure plant grows to 200% of the height of the bone meal plant. To find 200% of 45 inches, we convert 200% to a decimal and multiply by 45:\n\\[\n200\\% = \\frac{200}{100} = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Height of cow manure plant} = 2 \\times 45 = 90 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the cow manure plant is \\(\\boxed{90}\\) inches.",

Therefore, we multiply 36 inches by 125% (which is the same as multiplying by 1.25):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height of bone meal plant} = 36 \\times 1.25 = 45 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the height of the cow manure plant. The cow manure plant grows to 200% of the height of the bone meal plant. Since the bone meal plant is 45 inches tall, we multiply 45 inches by 200% (which is the same as multiplying by 2):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Height of cow manure plant} = 45 \\times 2 = 90 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThus, the height of the cow manure plant is \\(\\boxed{90}\\) inches.",

To find 125% of 36 inches, we multiply 36 by 1.25:\n\\[\n36 \\times 1.25 = 45\n\\]\nSo, the height of the bone meal plant is 45 inches.\n\nNow, we calculate the height of the cow manure plant. The cow manure plant grows to 200% of the height of the bone meal plant. To find 200% of 45 inches, we multiply 45 by 2.00:\n\\[\n45 \\times 2.00 = 90\n\\]\nSo, the height of the cow manure plant is 90 inches.\n\nTherefore, the height of the cow manure plant is \\boxed{90}.",
