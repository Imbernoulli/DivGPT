        "Cristine started with a dozen lemons, which is equal to 12 lemons. She gave \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of them to her neighbor. To find out how many lemons she gave to her neighbor, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, Cristine gave 3 lemons to her neighbor. To find out how many lemons she has left, we subtract the number of lemons she gave away from the total number of lemons she started with:\n\n\\[\n12 - 3 = 9\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Cristine has \\(\\boxed{9}\\) lemons left.",
