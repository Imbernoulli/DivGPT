In a particular month, they hired 200 more employees on the first week than on the second week, and 150 fewer employees on the second week than on the third week. If the number of employees hired on the fourth week was twice the number hired in the third week,  and the number of employees on the fourth week was 400, what's the average number of employees hired per week?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The number of employees hired on the first week is 200 more than on the second week, so we can write:\n   \\[\n   x_1 = x_2 + 200\n   \\]\n2. The number of employees hired on the second week is 150 fewer than on the third week, so we can write:\n   \\[\n   x_2 = x_3 - 150\n   \\]\n3. The number of employees hired on the fourth week is twice the number hired on the third week, so we can write:\n   \\[\n   x_4 = 2x_3\n   \\]\n4. The number of employees hired on the fourth week is 400, so we can write:\n   \\[\n   x_4 = 400\n   \\]\n\nUsing the fourth equation, we can substitute \\( x_4 = 400 \\) into the third equation to find \\( x_3 \\):\n\\[\n400 = 2x_3 \\implies x_3 = \\frac{400}{2} = 200\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\( x_3 = 200 \\), we can substitute this value into the second equation to find \\( x_2 \\):\n\\[\nx_2 = 200 - 150 = 50\n\\]\n\nNext, we substitute \\( x_2 = 50 \\) into the first equation to find \\( x_1 \\):\n\\[\nx_1 = 50 + 200 = 250\n\\]\n\nNow we have the number of employees hired each week:\n\\[\nx_1 = 250, \\quad x_2 = 50, \\quad x_3 = 200, \\quad x_4 = 400\n\\]\n\nTo find the average number of employees hired per week, we sum the number of employees hired each week and divide by 4:\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4}{4} = \\frac{250 + 50 + 200 + 400}{4} = \\frac{900}{4} = 225\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of employees hired per week is \\(\\boxed{225}\\).",

The number of employees hired on the first week is \\( x + 200 \\).\n2. The number of employees hired on the third week is \\( x + 150 \\).\n3. The number of employees hired on the fourth week is twice the number hired on the third week, which is \\( 2(x + 150) \\).\n4. The number of employees hired on the fourth week is 400.\n\nWe can set up the equation for the fourth week:\n\\[ 2(x + 150) = 400 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x + 150 = \\frac{400}{2} \\]\n\\[ x + 150 = 200 \\]\n\\[ x = 200 - 150 \\]\n\\[ x = 50 \\]\n\nNow that we know \\( x = 50 \\), we can find the number of employees hired each week:\n- First week: \\( x + 200 = 50 + 200 = 250 \\)\n- Second week: \\( x = 50 \\)\n- Third week: \\( x + 150 = 50 + 150 = 200 \\)\n- Fourth week: \\( 400 \\)\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of employees hired in the month:\n\\[ 250 + 50 + 200 + 400 = 900 \\]\n\nTo find the average number of employees hired per week, we divide the total number of employees by the number of weeks (4):\n\\[ \\text{Average} = \\frac{900}{4} = 225 \\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of employees hired per week is \\(\\boxed{225}\\).",
        "Let's define the number of employees hired on the second week as \\( x \\). Then, according to the problem, the number of employees hired on the first week is \\( x + 200 \\), the number of employees hired on the third week is \\( x + 150 \\), and the number of employees hired on the fourth week is twice the number hired on the third week, which is \\( 2(x + 150) \\). We are given that the number of employees hired on the fourth week is 400. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n2(x + 150) = 400\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx + 150 = \\frac{400}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 150 = 200\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 200 - 150\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 50\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of employees hired on the second week is 50. Now we can find the number of employees hired on the other weeks:\n\n- The number of employees hired on the first week is \\( x + 200 = 50 + 200 = 250 \\).\n- The number of employees hired on the third week is \\( x + 150 = 50 + 150 = 200 \\).\n- The number of employees hired on the fourth week is 400.\n\nThe total number of employees hired in the month is:\n\n\\[\n250 + 50 + 200 + 400 = 900\n\\]\n\nThe average number of employees hired per week is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{900}{4} = 225\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of employees hired per week is \\(\\boxed{225}\\).",
        "To find the average number of employees hired per week, we need to determine the number of employees hired each week and then calculate the average.\n\nLet's denote the number of employees hired on the second week as \\( x \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. The number of employees hired on the first week is 200 more than on the second week, so the number hired on the first week is \\( x + 200 \\).\n2. The number of employees hired on the second week is 150 fewer than on the third week, so the number hired on the third week is \\( x + 150 \\).\n3. The number of employees hired on the fourth week is twice the number hired on the third week, so the number hired on the fourth week is \\( 2(x + 150) \\).\n4.
