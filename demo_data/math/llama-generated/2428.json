        "To determine how many meters of wire Ernest did not use, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the length of each part of the wire after Ernest cut it into 5 equal parts.\n2. Determine the total length of wire used by Ernest.\n3. Subtract the length of wire used from the original length of wire to find the length of wire not used.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Ernest bought 50 meters of wire and cut it into 5 equal parts. Therefore, the length of each part is:\n\\[\n\\frac{50 \\text{ meters}}{5} = 10 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nNext, Ernest used 3 parts of the wire. Since each part is 10 meters long, the total length of wire used is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 10 \\text{ meters} = 30 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nFinally, to find out how many meters of wire is not used, we subtract the length of wire used from the original length of wire:\n\\[\n50 \\text{ meters} - 30 \\text{ meters} = 20 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of meters of wire that is not used is \\boxed{20}.",
