        "To determine the total number of dinners sold over the four days, we need to calculate the number of dinners sold each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many dinners were sold on each day:\n- On Monday, the restaurant sold 40 dinners.\n- On Tuesday, the restaurant sold 40 more dinners than on Monday. Therefore, the number of dinners sold on Tuesday is \\(40 + 40 = 80\\).\n- On Wednesday, the restaurant sold half the amount of dinners it sold on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of dinners sold on Wednesday is \\(\\frac{80}{2} = 40\\).\n- On Thursday, the restaurant sold 3 more dinners than on Wednesday.
