According to the problem, Mara has 40 cards less than 150. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n150 - 40 = 110\n\\]\nSo, Mara has 110 cards.\n\nNext, we know that Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. Let \\( J \\) represent the number of cards Janet has. Then we can write the equation:\n\\[\n2J = 110\n\\]\nTo find \\( J \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\nJ = \\frac{110}{2} = 55\n\\]\nSo, Janet has 55 cards.\n\nWe also know that Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda. Let \\( B \\) represent the number of cards Brenda has. Then we can write the equation:\n\\[\nJ = B + 9\n\\]\nSince \\( J = 55 \\), we substitute 55 for \\( J \\) in the equation:\n\\[\n55 = B + 9\n\\]\nTo find \\( B \\), we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nB = 55 - 9 = 46\n\\]\nSo, Brenda has 46 cards.\n\nNow, we add up the number of cards each person has to find the total number of cards:\n\\[\nJ + B + M = 55 + 46 + 110 = 211\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of cards they have is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{211}\n\\]",
