        "To determine how many degrees the blankets warmed Nathan up, we start by calculating the number of blankets he added to his bed. Nathan added half of the 14 blankets in his closet. So, we perform the following calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14}{2} = 7\n\\]\n\nThis means Nathan added 7 blankets to his bed. Each blanket warms him up by 3 degrees. Therefore, the total increase in temperature from the blankets is:\n\n\\[\n7 \\times 3 = 21\n\\]\n\nSo, the blankets warmed Nathan up by \\(\\boxed{21}\\) degrees.",
