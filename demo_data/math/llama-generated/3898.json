        "To determine how many jars of strawberry jelly the grocery store sold, we need to set up equations based on the given relationships between the sales of the different types of jelly.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- \\( s \\) represents the number of jars of strawberry jelly sold.\n- \\( g \\) represents the number of jars of grape jelly sold.\n- \\( r \\) represents the number of jars of raspberry jelly sold.\n- \\( p \\) represents the number of jars of plum jelly sold.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n1.

Raspberry jelly sells a third as much as grape jelly: \\( r = \\frac{1}{3}g \\).\n4.
