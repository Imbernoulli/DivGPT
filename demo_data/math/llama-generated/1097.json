        "To determine how many dollars Todd saved on the original price of the jeans, we need to follow the sequence of discounts and calculate the final price step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the sale price after the 20% discount:**\n   The original price of the jeans is $125. A 20% discount means Todd pays 80% of the original price.\n   \\[\n   125 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 125 \\times 0.80 = 100\n   \\]\n   So, the sale price is $100.\n\n2. **Apply the $10 coupon:**\n   After the sale price, Todd applies a coupon that takes off $10.\n   \\[\n   100 - 10 = 90\n   \\]\n   So, the price after the coupon is $90.\n\n3. **Calculate the final price after the 10% discount on the store credit card:**\n   The store credit card gives Todd an additional 10% off the remaining $90. This means Todd pays 90% of $90.\n   \\[\n   90 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 90 \\times 0.90 = 81\n   \\]\n   So, the final price Todd pays is $81.\n\n4. **Determine the total savings:**\n   The original price of the jeans was $125, and Todd paid $81. The total savings is the difference between the original price and the final price.\n   \\[\n   125 - 81 = 44\n   \\]\n   So, Todd saved \\(\\boxed{44}\\) dollars on the original price of the jeans."
