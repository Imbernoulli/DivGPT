        "To determine the total amount Celina spent on her equipment, we need to calculate the cost of each item individually and then sum these costs.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of the flashlight. The hoodie cost $80, and the flashlight was 20% of that price. Therefore, the cost of the flashlight is:\n\\[\n80 \\times 0.20 = 16 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the boots. The original price of the boots was $110, but Celina was able to buy them at a 10% discount. This means she paid 90% of the original price. Therefore, the cost of the boots is:\n\\[\n110 \\times 0.90 = 99 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the costs of the hoodie, the flashlight, and the boots:\n\\[\n80 + 16 + 99 = 195 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount Celina spent on the equipment is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{195}\n\\]",
