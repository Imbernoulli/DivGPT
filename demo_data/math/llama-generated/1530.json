        "To determine the total number of dolls Hannah and her sister have together, we start by identifying how many dolls each person has.\n\nFirst, we know that Hannah's sister has 8 dolls. According to the problem, Hannah has 5 times as many dolls as her sister. Therefore, we calculate the number of dolls Hannah has by multiplying the number of dolls her sister has by 5:\n\\[\n5 \\times 8 = 40\n\\]\nSo, Hannah has 40 dolls.\n\nNext, we add the number of dolls Hannah has to the number of dolls her sister has to find the total number of dolls they have together:\n\\[\n40 + 8 = 48\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of dolls they have altogether is \\boxed{48}.",
