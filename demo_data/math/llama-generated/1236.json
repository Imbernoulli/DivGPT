        "To determine the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the morning before the markets opened, we need to work backwards from the ending value after the 2% drop.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the value of the Dow in the morning. According to the problem, the Dow fell by 2% during the day, and it ended at 8,722. This means that the ending value is 98% of the morning value.

        "To determine the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the morning before the markets opened, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that the Dow fell by 2% during the day and ended the day at 8,722. Let's denote the value of the Dow in the morning by \\( x \\).\n\nSince the Dow fell by 2%, the value of the Dow at the end of the day is 98% of the morning value. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\\[ 0.98x = 8722 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.98:\n\\[ x = \\frac{8722}{0.98} \\]\n\nNow, let's perform the division:\n\\[ x = 8900 \\]\n\nTherefore, the Dow in the morning before the markets opened was \\(\\boxed{8900}\\)."
