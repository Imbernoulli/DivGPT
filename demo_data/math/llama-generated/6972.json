        "To determine the total number of books Nancy had on the book cart when she started, we need to account for all the books she shelved and the books she put back into place.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of books Nancy shelved from the top section of the cart:\n- History books: 12\n- Romance books: 8\n- Poetry books: 4\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n12 + 8 + 4 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, Nancy shelved 24 books from the top section.\n\nNext, let's consider the bottom section of the cart. Nancy shelved 5 Western novels and 6 biographies, which totals:\n\\[\n5 + 6 = 11\n\\]\n\nWe are also given that half the books on the bottom section were mystery books, and she put these back into place. Let \\( x \\) be the total number of books on the bottom section. Therefore, the number of mystery books is:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\nAfter putting the mystery books back, Nancy shelved the remaining books on the bottom section. We know this remaining number is 11. Thus, the equation relationship between the total bottom section books and the shelved books is:\n\\[\nx - \\frac{x}{2} = 11\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{2x}{2} - \\frac{x}{2} = 11\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} = 11\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx = 22\n\\]\n\nSo, there were 22 books on the bottom section of the cart when she started.\n\nFinally, we add the books from the top section and the bottom section to find the total number of books on the cart:\n\\[\n24 + 22 = 46\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of books Nancy had on the book cart when she started is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{46}\n\\]",
