        "To determine how many fewer eyes the lizard has than the combined number of spots and wrinkles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of eyes the lizard has.\n2. Calculate the number of wrinkles.\n3. Calculate the number of spots.\n4. Find the combined number of spots and wrinkles.\n5. Determine how many fewer eyes the lizard has than the combined number of spots and wrinkles.\n\nLet's start with the number of eyes. The lizard has 3 eyes.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of wrinkles. The problem states that the lizard has 3 times more wrinkles than eyes. Therefore, the number of wrinkles is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the number of spots. The problem states that the lizard has seven times more spots than wrinkles. Therefore, the number of spots is:\n\\[ 7 \\times 9 = 63 \\]\n\nNow, we find the combined number of spots and wrinkles:\n\\[ 9 + 63 = 72 \\]\n\nFinally, we determine how many fewer eyes the lizard has than the combined number of spots and wrinkles:\n\\[ 72 - 3 = 69 \\]\n\nThus, the lizard has \\(\\boxed{69}\\) fewer eyes than the combined number of spots and wrinkles.",

Since it is a three-eyed lizard, the number of eyes is:\n\\[ \\text{Eyes} = 3 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of wrinkles the lizard has. According to the problem, the lizard has 3 times more wrinkles than eyes. Therefore, the number of wrinkles is:\n\\[ \\text{,Object} = 3 \\times \\text{Eyes} = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the number of spots the lizard has. The problem states that the lizard has seven times more spots than wrinkles. Therefore, the number of spots is:\n\\[ \\text{Spots} = 7 \\times \\text{ capitalize} = 7 \\times 9 = 63 \\]\n\nNow, we find the combined number of spots and wrinkles:\n\\[ \\text{Combined spots and wrinkles} = \\text{Spots} + \\text{師} = 63 + 9 = 72 \\]\n\nFinally, we determine how many fewer eyes the lizard has than the combined number of spots and wrinkles:\n\\[ \\text{ few Tiger} = \\text{Combined spots and wrinkles} - \\text{Eyes} = 72 - 3 = 69 \\]\n\nThus, the lizard has \\(\\boxed{69}\\) fewer eyes than the combined number of spots and wrinkles.",
