        "To determine how much money Sally needs to pay out of pocket, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the books:**\n   Each reading book costs $12, and there are 30 students in the class.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost per book} \\times \\text{Number of students} = 12 \\times 30\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 30 = 360\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the books is $360.\n\n3. **Determine how much more money is needed:**\n   Sally is given $320 to spend on the books. We need to find out how much more money is required to cover the total cost of $360.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional money needed} = \\text{Total cost} - \\text{Money given} = 360 - 320\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the subtraction:**\n   \\[\n   360 - 320 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, Sally needs to pay an additional $40 out of pocket.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Sally needs to pay out of pocket is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
