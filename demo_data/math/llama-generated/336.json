        "To determine how many seconds Ned will have to diffuse the bomb when he reaches the top floor, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time Ned has spent running up the stairs.\n2. Determine how many flights of stairs Ned has climbed.\n3. Calculate the remaining time on the bomb after Ned has climbed the stairs.\n\nFirst, we know that Ned can run up one flight of stairs in 11 seconds. Since he has spent 165 seconds running up the stairs, we can find out how many flights of stairs he has climbed by dividing 165 by 11:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{165}{11} = 15\n\\]\n\nSo, Ned has climbed 15 flights of stairs. The building has 20 flights of stairs to the top floor, so Ned still needs to climb:\n\n\\[\n20 - 15 = 5\n\\]\n\nflights of stairs. Since each flight takes 11 seconds, the time it will take Ned to climb the remaining 5 flights is:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 11 = 55 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nThe time bomb has 72 seconds left on the timer when Ned starts climbing the remaining flights of stairs. After he climbs the 5 flights, the remaining time on the bomb will be:\n\n\\[\n72 - 55 = 17 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Ned will have \\(\\boxed{17}\\) seconds to diffuse the bomb when he reaches the top floor.",

Therefore, the total time Ned has to reach the top floor is:\n\\[ 72 + 165 = 237 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the time Ned spends running up the stairs from the total time he has to reach the top floor to find out how many seconds Ned will have to diffuse the bomb when he reaches it:\n\\[ 237 - 220 = 17 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nThus, the number of seconds Ned will have to diffuse the bomb when he reaches it is:\n\\[ \\boxed{17} \\]",

Subtract the time Ned takes to sell the bomb from the remaining time on the bomb.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total time Ned has taken to run up the stairs.

Calculate the time it will take Ned to climb the remaining flights of stairs.\n5. Subtract the time it will take Ned to climb the remaining flights of stairs from the time left on the bomb.\n\nFirst, we know that Ned has spent 165 seconds running up the stairs. Since he can run up one flight of stairs in 11 seconds, we can find out how many flights of stairs he has climbed by dividing the total time by the time per flight:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of flights climbed} = \\frac{165}{11} = 15\n\\]\nSo, Ned has climbed 15 flights of stairs. Since the building has 20 flights of stairs, the number of flights Ned still needs to climb is:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining flights} = 20 - 15 = 5\n\\]\nNext, we calculate the time it will take Ned to climb the remaining 5 flights of stairs.
