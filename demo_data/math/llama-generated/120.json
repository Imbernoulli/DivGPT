        "To determine the minimum number of rides needed each month for the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper per ride than buying one-way tickets, we start by setting up the inequality comparing the total cost of the one-way tickets to the total cost of the 30-day pass.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of rides taken in a month. The cost of \\( x \\) one-way tickets is \\( 2x \\) dollars. The cost of the 30-day pass is $50. We want the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper than the one-way tickets, so we set up the inequality:\n\\[ 2x > 50 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the inequality by 2:\n\\[ x > 25 \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) must be a whole number (you can't take a fraction of a ride), the smallest integer greater than 25 is 26. Therefore, the minimum number of rides you will need to take every month so that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).\n\nTo verify, let's check the cost per ride for 25 rides and 26 rides:\n- For 25 rides, the total cost is \\( 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\) dollars. The cost per ride is \\( \\frac{50}{25} = 2 \\) dollars.\n- For 26 rides, the total cost is \\( 2 \\times 26 = 52 \\) dollars. The cost per ride is \\( \\frac{52}{26} = 2 \\) dollars for the first 25 rides, but since we are comparing the per ride cost strictly, we need to对未来================================================ ≠

        "To determine the minimum number of rides needed each month for the 30-day pass to be strictly cheaper per ride than buying individual one-way tickets, we need to compare the total cost of each option and find the point where the cost per ride using the pass is less than the cost per ride using one-way tickets.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- \\( x \\) is the number of rides taken in a month.\n- The cost of a one-way ticket is $2.\n- The cost of a 30-day pass is $50.\n\nThe total cost of buying one-way tickets for \\( x \\) rides is:\n\\[ 2x \\]\n\nThe cost per ride using the 30-day pass is:\n\\[ \\frac{50}{x} \\]\n\nWe want the cost per ride using the pass to be strictly less than the cost per ride using one-way tickets:\n\\[ \\frac{50}{x} < 2 \\]\n\nTo solve this inequality, we multiply both sides by \\( x \\) (assuming \\( x > 0 \\)):\n\\[ 50 < 2x \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[ 25 < x \\]\n\\[ x > 25 \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) must be a whole number (you can't take a fraction of a ride), the smallest integer greater than 25 is 26. Therefore, the minimum number of rides you will need to take every month so that the 30-day pass is strictly cheaper per ride is:\n\\[ \\boxed{26} \\]\n\nTo verify, let's check the cost per ride for 26 rides:\n- Cost with one-way tickets: \\( 2 \\times 26 = 52 \\) dollars.\n- Cost per ride with the pass: \\( \\frac{50}{26} \\approx 1.92 \\) dollars.\nSince $1.92 < $2, the pass is indeed cheaper per ride for 26 rides.\n\nFor 25 rides:\n- Cost with one-way tickets: \\( 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\) dollars.\n- Cost per ride with the pass: \\( \\frac{50}{25} = 2 \\) dollars.\nSince $2 = $2, the pass is not cheaper per ride for 25 rides.\n\nThus, the minimum number of rides needed is indeed \\(\\boxed{26}\\).",
