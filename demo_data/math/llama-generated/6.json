        "To determine the number of trash cans now in Veteran's Park, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of trash cans originally in Central Park.\n2. Determine how many trash cans were moved from Central Park to Veteran's Park.\n3. Calculate the new number of trash cans in Veteran's Park.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of trash cans originally in Central Park.**\n\nWe know that Central Park had 8 more than half the number of trash cans as in Veteran's Park. Given that Veteran's Park originally had 24 trash cans, we can calculate the number of trash cans in Central Park as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of trash cans in Central Park} = \\frac{24}{2} + 8 = 12 + 8 = 20\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many trash cans were moved from Central Park to Veteran's Park.**\n\nOne night, someone took half of the trash cans from Central Park and put them in Veteran's Park. Therefore, the number of trash cans moved is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of trash cans moved} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the new number of trash cans in Veteran's Park.**\n\nThe new number of trash cans in Veteran's Park is the original number of trash cans plus the number of trash cans moved from Central Park:\n\\[\n\\text{New number of trash cans in Veteran's Park} = 24 + 10 = 34\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of trash cans now in Veteran's Park is \\(\\boxed{34}\\).",
