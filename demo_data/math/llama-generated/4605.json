        "To determine how long it will take Peter to rake 8 bags of leaves, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the rate at which Peter rakes leaves:**\n   Peter rakes 3 bags of leaves in 15 minutes. To find the rate per bag, we divide the total time by the number of bags:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rate per bag} = \\frac{15 \\text{ minutes}}{3 \\text{ bags}} = 5 \\text{ minutes per bag}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total time for 8 bags:**\n   Now that we know it takes Peter 5 minutes to rake one bag, we can find the total time for 8 bags by multiplying the rate per bag by the number of bags:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = 5 \\text{ minutes per bag} \\times 8 \\text{ bags} = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Peter \\(\\boxed{40}\\) minutes to rake 8 bags of leaves.",
        "To determine how long it will take Peter to rake 8 bags of leaves, we need to find out how long it takes him to rake one bag and then use that rate to calculate the time for 8 bags.\n\nFirst, we find the rate at which Peter rakes leaves. It takes him 15 minutes to rake 3 bags. Therefore, the time it takes to rake one bag is:\n\\[\n\\frac{15 \\text{ minutes}}{3 \\text{ bags}} = 5 \\text{ minutes per bag}\n\\]\n\nNext, we use this rate to find out how long it takes to rake 8 bags.
