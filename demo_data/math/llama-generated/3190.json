The base sentence is 1 year of jail for every $5,000 of goods stolen. The burglar is going to have his sentence length increased by 25% because this is his third offense, plus 2 additional years for resisting arrest.

        "To determine the burglar's total jail sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the base sentence based on the value of the goods stolen.\n2.

Sum all the parts to get the total sentence.\n\nLet's start with the base sentence. The base sentence is 1 year of jail for every $5,000 of goods stolen. The burglar stole $40,000 worth of goods. So, we calculate the base sentence as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Base sentence} = \\frac{40,000}{5,000} = 8 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nNext, we increase the base sentence by 25% because this is the burglar's third offense.
