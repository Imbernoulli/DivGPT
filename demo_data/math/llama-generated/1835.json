She planned to buy 30 models at a price of $0.45 each:\n\\[\n30 \\times 0.45 = 13.50\n\\]\nSo, Kirsty has saved $13.50.\n\nNext, we need to determine the new price per model. The price has increased to $0.50. Now, we calculate how many models she can buy with $13.50 at the new price:\n\\[\n13.50 \\div 0.50 = 27\n\\]\nSince Kirsty cannot buy a fraction of a model, she can buy 27 models.\n\nTherefore, the number of models Kirsty can buy now is \\boxed{27}.",
        "To determine how many models Kirsty can buy now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Kirsty has.\n2. Determine how many models she can buy with that amount at the new price.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Kirsty has.**\n\nKirsty saves enough to buy 30 models at the original price of $0.45 each. Therefore, the total amount of money she has is:\n\\[\n30 \\times 0.45 = 13.50\n\\]\nSo, Kirsty has $13.50.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many models she can buy with that amount at the new price.**\n\nThe new price of each model is $0.50. To find out how many models she can buy with $13.50 at the new price, we divide $13.50 by $0.50:\n\\[\n13.50 \\div 0.50 = 27\n\\]\nSo, Kirsty can buy 27 models now.\n\nTherefore, the number of models Kirsty can buy now is \\(\\boxed{27}\\).",
