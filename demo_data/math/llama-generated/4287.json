        "To determine how many pounds of swords each orc has to carry, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of orcs.\n2.

        "To determine how many pounds of swords each orc has to carry, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of orcs.\n2. Divide the total weight of the swords by the total number of orcs.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of orcs. The Dark Lord has 10 squads, and each squad has 8 orcs. Therefore, the total number of orcs is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ squads} \\times 8 \\text{ orcs per squad} = 80 \\text{ orcs} \\]\n\nNext, we divide the total weight of the swords by the total number of orcs. The total weight of the swords is 1200 pounds. Therefore, the weight each orc has to carry is:\n\\[ \\frac{1200 \\text{ pounds}}{80 \\text{ orcs}} = 15 \\text{ pounds per orc} \\]\n\nThus, each orc has to carry \\(\\boxed{15}\\) pounds of swords.",
