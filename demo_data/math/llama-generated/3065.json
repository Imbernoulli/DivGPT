A family of 4 arrives and gets their oranges. They had planned to stop for a snack later where they would spend $15 in total, but now that they have the oranges they don't have to buy them at the stop. When they get to the stop they see that the oranges would've cost $1.5 each. What percentage of the money they planned to spend did they save instead?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the percentage of the money the family saved, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of oranges the family received.\n2. Determine the total cost of the oranges if they had to buy them.\n3. Calculate the percentage of the planned spending that corresponds to the cost of the oranges.\n\nFirst, we know the family consists of 4 people, and each person gets one orange. Therefore, the total number of oranges they received is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ oranges} \\]\n\nNext, we know that each orange costs $1.5. So, the total cost of the oranges would have been:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ oranges} \\times \\$1.5 \\text{ per orange} = \\$6 \\]\n\nThe family had planned to spend $15 in total, but since they received the oranges for free, they saved $6. To find out what percentage of the planned spending this savings represents, we use the formula for percentage:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage saved} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Amount saved}}{\\text{Planned spending}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage saved} = \\left( \\frac{6}{15} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.4 \\times 100 = 40\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the money they planned to spend that they saved is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",

Determine the amount of money they saved by not having to buy the oranges.\n3. Calculate the percentage of the planned spending that they saved.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the oranges. Since the family has 4 passengers, they get 4 oranges. Each orange costs $1.5, so the total cost of the oranges is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 1.5 = 6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the amount of money they saved by not having to buy the oranges. They originally planned to spend $15, but now they only have to spend $15 - $6 = $9. The amount of money they saved is $6.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of the planned spending that they saved. This is done by dividing the amount of money saved by the original planned spending and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{6}{15} \\right) \\times 100 = 40\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the money they planned to spend that they saved is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",

Determine the total cost of the oranges if they had to buy them.\n3. Calculate the percentage of the planned spending that corresponds to the cost of the oranges.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of oranges the family received.**\n\nThe family consists of 4 people, and each person gets one orange. Therefore, the total number of oranges is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ oranges} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total cost of the oranges if they had to buy them.**\n\nEach orange costs $1.5, so the total cost for 4 oranges is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ oranges} \\times \\$1.5 \\text{ per orange} = \\$6 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the planned spending that corresponds to the cost of the oranges.**\n\nThe family planned to spend $15 in total. The amount they saved is the cost of the oranges, which is $6. To find the percentage of the planned spending that they saved, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage saved} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Amount saved}}{\\text{Planned spending}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage saved} = \\left( \\frac{6}{15} \\right) \\times 100 = 40\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the money they planned to spend that they saved is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]"
