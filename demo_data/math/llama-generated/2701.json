        "To determine who has read more books across the two months and by how much, we need to calculate the total number of books read by William and Brad over the two months and then compare the totals.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of books read by William:\n\n1. Last month, William read 6 books.\n2. This month, William read twice as many books as Brad. Since Brad read 8 books this month, William read \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) books this month.\n3. Therefore, the total number of books read by William over the two months is \\(6 + 16 = 22\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of books read by Brad:\n\n1. Last month, Brad read three times as many books as William. Since William read 6 books last month, Brad read \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\) books last month.\n2. This month, Brad read 8 books.\n3. Therefore, the total number of books read by Brad over the two months is \\(18 + 8 = 26\\).\n\nNow, we compare the total number of books read by William and Brad:\n\n1. Brad has read 26 books, and William has read 22 books.\n2. The difference in the number of books read is \\(26 - 22 = 4\\).\n\nThus, Brad has read more books across the two months by \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
