        "To determine how many kilograms of meat Jackson has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of meat used for meatballs:**\n   Jackson used \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the meat to make meatballs. Since he started with 20 kilograms of meat, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 = 5 \\text{ kilograms}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of meat used:**\n   Jackson used 5 kilograms for meatballs and 3 kilograms for spring rolls. Adding these amounts together gives:\n   \\[\n   5 + 3 = 8 \\text{ kilograms}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the amount of meat left:**\n   Subtract the total amount of meat used from the initial amount of meat:\n   \\[\n   20 - 8 = 12 \\text{ kilograms}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of kilograms of meat left is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",

Therefore, the total amount of meat used is the sum of the meat used for meatballs and the meat used for spring rolls:\n\\[\n5 + 3 = 8 \\text{ kilograms}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount of meat used from the original amount of meat:\n\\[\n20 - 8 = 12 \\text{ kilograms}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of kilograms of meat left is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",

Subtract the amount of meat used to make meatballs from the initial amount of meat.\n3. Subtract the amount of meat used to make spring rolls from the remaining amount of meat.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Jackson used \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the meat to make meatballs. Since he initially had 20 kilograms of meat, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 = 5 \\text{ kilograms}\n   \\]\n   So, Jackson used 5 kilograms of meat to make meatballs.\n\n2. Subtract the amount of meat used to make meatballs from the initial amount of meat:\n   \\[\n   20 - 5 = 15 \\text{ kilograms}\n   \\]\n   So, after making meatballs, Jackson has 15 kilograms of meat left.\n\n3. Jackson then used 3 kilograms of meat to make spring rolls. Subtract the amount of meat used to make spring rolls from the remaining amount of meat:\n   \\[\n   15 - 3 = 12 \\text{ kilograms}\n   \\]\n   So, after making spring rolls, Jackson has 12 kilograms of meat left.\n\nTherefore, the number of kilograms of meat left is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
