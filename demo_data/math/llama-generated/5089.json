        "To determine the total distance driven by Renaldo and Ernesto, we start by calculating the distance driven by each person individually.\n\nFirst, we know that Renaldo drove 15 kilometers. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Distance driven by Renaldo} = 15 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how far Ernesto drove. According to the problem, Ernesto drove 7 kilometers more than one-third of Renaldo's distance. First, we calculate one-third of Renaldo's distance:\n\\[ \\text{One-third of Renaldo's distance} = \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nThen, we add 7 kilometers to this value to find the distance driven by Ernesto:\n\\[ \\text{Distance driven by Ernesto} = 5 + 7 = 12 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nNow, we add the distances driven by Renaldo and Ernesto to find the total distance driven by both men:\n\\[ \\text{Total distance driven} = \\text{Distance driven by Renaldo} + \\text{Distance driven by Ernesto} = 15 + 12 = 27 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance driven by the two men is:\n\\[ \\boxed{27} \\]",
