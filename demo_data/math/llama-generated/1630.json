        "To determine the cost of the box of cookies, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of supplies for making the bracelets.\n2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bracelets.\n3. Determine the net profit from selling the bracelets.\n4. Use the net profit to find out how much the box of cookies cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of supplies for making the bracelets. Josh makes 12 bracelets, and it costs $1 for supplies for each bracelet:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ bracelets} \\times \\$1 \\text{ per bracelet} = \\$12\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bracelets. Josh sells each bracelet for $1.5, and he makes 12 bracelets:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ bracelets} \\times \\$1.5 \\text{ per bracelet} = \\$18\n\\]\n\nNow, we determine the net profit from selling the bracelets by subtracting the total cost of supplies from the total revenue:\n\\[\n\\$18 - \\$12 = \\$6\n\\]\n\n Josh has $3 left after buying the cookies. Since the net profit from selling the bracelets is $6, the cost of the box of cookies is:\n\\[\n\\$6 - \\$3 = \\$3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the box of cookies is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

Use the net profit to find out how much the box of cookies cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total revenue Josh earns from selling the bracelets. He sells each bracelet for $1.5 and makes 12 bracelets:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ bracelets} \\times \\$1.5 \\text{ per bracelet} = \\$18\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the supplies for the bracelets. Each bracelet costs $1 in supplies and he makes 12 bracelets:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ bracelets} \\times \\$1 \\text{ per bracelet} = \\$12\n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine the net profit from making and selling the bracelets. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost of supplies:\n\\[\n\\$18 - \\$12 = \\$6\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, after buying the cookies, Josh still has $3. This means that the cost of the box of cookies is the net profit minus the amount of money he has left:\n\\[\n\\$6 - \\$3 = \\$3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the box of cookies is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

The total amount of money Josh has after making and selling the bracelets is the total revenue minus the total cost of supplies:\n   \\[\n   \\$18 - \\$12 = \\$6\n   \\]\n\n4. After buying the cookies, Josh still has $3. Therefore, the cost of the box of cookies is the total amount of money he had after making and selling the bracelets minus the amount of money he has after buying the cookies:\n   \\[\n   \\$6 - \\$3 = \\$3\n   \\]\n\nThus, the cost of the box of cookies is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
