So, the total number of cakes he usually bakes is:\n\\[ 6 + 5 + 8 = 19 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of cakes Carter baked this week. He baked triple the number of cheesecakes, muffins, and red velvet cakes, and he also baked chocolate moist cakes. Since the problem does not specify how many chocolate moist cakes he usually bakes, we will assume he did not bake any chocolate moist cakes regularly.

        "To determine how many more cakes Carter was able to bake this week, we need to compare the number of cakes he baked this week to the number of cakes he bakes regularly in a week. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cakes Carter bakes regularly in a week:\n- Cheesecakes: 6\n- Muffins: 5\n- Red velvet cakes: 8\n\nThe total number of cakes baked regularly in a week is:\n\\[ 6 + 5 + 8 = 19 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of cakes Carter baked this week. Since he baked triple the number of cheesecakes, muffins, and red velvet cakes, we need to find out how many of each type of cake he baked this week:\n- Cheesecakes: \\( 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\)\n- Muffins: \\( 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\)\n- Red velvet cakes: \\( 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\)\n\nSince he also baked chocolate moist cakes, and we don't know how many chocolate moist cakes he bakes regularly, we assume he did not bake any chocolate moist cakes regularly. Therefore, the total number of chocolate moist cakes he baked this week is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 0 = 0 \\]\n\nThe total number of cakes baked this week is:\n\\[ 18 + 15 + 24 + 0 = 57 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more cakes Carter baked this week compared to a regular week:\n\\[ 57 - 19 = 38 \\]\n\nSo, Carter was able to bake \\(\\boxed{38}\\) more cakes for this week."
