        "To determine the total number of bricks of snow Libby used to build her igloo, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the bottom half and the top half of the igloo.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of bricks in the bottom half of the igloo.

Therefore, the total number of bricks in the bottom half is:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ rows} \\times 12 \\text{ bricks per row} = 60 \\text{ bricks}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of bricks in the top half of the igloo.
