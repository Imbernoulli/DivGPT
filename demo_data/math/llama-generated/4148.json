        "To determine how much money Sally can make from selling all of her seashells, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of seashells Sally picks on Tuesday.\n2. Find the total number of seashells Sally has from Monday and Tuesday.\n3. Calculate the total amount of money Sally can make by selling all her seashells.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many seashells Sally picks on Tuesday. Since she picks half as many seashells on Tuesday as she did on Monday, we can calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Seashells picked on Tuesday} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of seashells Sally has from both days. We add the seashells picked on Monday to the seashells picked on Tuesday:\n\\[\n\\text{Total seashells} = 30 + 15 = 45\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total amount of money Sally can make by selling all her seashells. Since she can sell each seashell for $1.20, we multiply the total number of seashells by the price per seashell:\n\\[\n\\text{Total money} = 45 \\times 1.20 = 54\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Sally can make if she sells all of her seashells is \\boxed{54}.",

Since she picks 30 seashells on Monday, we can find the number of seashells she picks on Tuesday by dividing 30 by 2:\n\n\\[ 30 \\div 2 = 15 \\]\n\nSo, Sally picks 15 seashells on Tuesday.\n\nNext, we find the total number of seashells Sally picks over the two days by adding the number of seashells she picks on Monday to the number of seashells she picks on Tuesday:\n\n\\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \\]\n\nSo, Sally picks a total of 45 seashells over the two days.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total amount of money Sally can make by selling all the seashells. Since she can sell each seashell for $1.20, we multiply the total number of seashells by $1.20:\n\n\\[ 45 \\times 1.20 = 54 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of money Sally can make if she sells all of her seashells is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{54} \\]",
