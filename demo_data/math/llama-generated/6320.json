        "To determine on which day Trish walks more than 10 times further than she did on the first day, we need to calculate the distance she walks each day and find when it exceeds 10 miles.\n\nFirst, let's define the distance Trish walks on the \\( n \\)-th day as \\( d_n \\).

To verify, we calculate the distance she walks on the 5th day:\n\\[\nd_5 = 2^{5-1} = 2^4 = 16\n\\]\n\nSince 16 miles is indeed greater than 10 miles, our solution is correct.
