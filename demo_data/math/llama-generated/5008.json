        "To determine the number of instances of bullying Kris is responsible for, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days Kris has been suspended.\n2. Determine how many instances of bullying correspond to that number of days.\n\nFirst, we know that a typical person has 10 fingers and 10 toes. Therefore, the total number of fingers and toes is:\n\\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\n\nKris has been suspended for three times as many days as the total number of fingers and toes. So, we multiply the total number of fingers and toes by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\]\n\nKris is suspended for 3 days for each instance of bullying. To find out how many instances of bullying she is responsible for, we divide the total number of days she has been suspended by the number of days per suspension:\n\\[ \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of instances of bullying Kris is responsible for is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",

Therefore, to find the number of instances of bullying, we divide the total number of days suspended by the number of days she is suspended for each instance:\n\n\\[ \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the number of instances of bullying Kris is responsible for is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
