Determine how many boys want to toast marshmallows.\n   50% of the boys want to toast marshmallows.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of boys who want to toast marshmallows} = 0.5 \\times 64 = 32\n   \\]\n\n4. Determine how many girls want to toast marshmallows.\n   75% of the girls want to toast marshmallows.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of girls who want to toast marshmallows} = 0.75 \\times 32 = 24\n   \\]\n\n5. Add the number of boys and girls who want to toast marshmallows to get the total number of marshmallows needed.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of marshmallows needed} = 32 + 24 = 56\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of marshmallows needed is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",
