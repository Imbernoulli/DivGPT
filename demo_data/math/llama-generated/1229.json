Each of these new galleries receives the same amount of pictures. For each picture, Alexander needs 4 pencils. For each exhibition, he needs another 2 pencils for signing his signature on the pictures. If Alexander uses 88 pencils on drawing and signing his pictures for all of the exhibitions, how many paintings are at each of the 5 new galleries?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "Let's denote the number of pictures Alexander draws for each of the 5 new galleries as \\( x \\). Therefore, the total number of pictures Alexander draws for the new galleries is \\( 5x \\). Adding the 9 pictures he originally drew, the total number of pictures he draws is \\( 9 + 5x \\).\n\nFor each picture, Alexander needs 4 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils needed for drawing all the pictures is:\n\\[ 4 \\times (9 + 5x) = 36 + 20x. \\]\n\nAdditionally, for each exhibition, Alexander needs 2 pencils to sign his signature on the pictures. Since there are 6 exhibitions in total (1 original and 5 new), the total number of pencils needed for signing is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 6 = 12. \\]\n\nThe total number of pencils Alexander uses is the sum of the pencils needed for drawing and signing:\n\\[ 36 + 20x + 12 = 48 + 20x. \\]\n\nWe know from the problem statement that Alexander uses 88 pencils in total. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 48 + 20x = 88. \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first subtract 48 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 20x = 40. \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 20:\n\\[ x = 2. \\]\n\nSo, the number of paintings at each of the 5 new galleries is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
