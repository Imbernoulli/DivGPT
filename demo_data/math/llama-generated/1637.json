Since he teaches 6 periods a day and each class has 30 students, the total number of students is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 30 = 180 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many index cards are required for all the students. Since each student gets 10 index cards, the total number of index cards needed is:\n\\[ 180 \\times 10 = 1800 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many 50-pack index cards are required. Since each pack contains 50 index cards, the number of packs needed is:\n\\[ \\frac{1800}{50} = 36 \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost. Since each 50-pack costs $3, the total cost is:\n\\[ 36 \\times 3 = 108 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Carl spent on index cards is:\n\\[ \\boxed{108} \\]",

Determine the number of 50-pack index card sets required.\n3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of 50-pack sets.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of index cards Carl needs. Carl gives each student 10 index cards and he teaches 6 periods a day with each class having 30 students. Therefore, the total number of students is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 30 = 180 \\text{ students} \\]\nSince each student gets 10 index cards, the total number of index cards needed is:\n\\[ 180 \\times 10 = 1800 \\text{ index cards} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many 50-pack index card sets are required. We do this by dividing the total number of index cards by the number of index cards in each pack:\n\\[ \\frac{1800}{50} = 36 \\text{ packs} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost. Since each 50-pack costs $3, the total cost is:\n\\[ 36 \\times 3 = 108 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Carl spent on index cards is:\n\\[ \\boxed{108} \\]",

Calculate the total cost of the index cards.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of index cards Carl needs.**\n\nCarl gives each student 10 index cards.

Therefore, the total number of students he teaches in a day is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ periods} \\times 30 \\text{ students/period} = 180 \\text{ students} \\]\n\nSince each student gets 10 index cards, the total number of index cards needed is:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ students} \\times 10 \\text{ index cards/student} = 1800 \\text{ index cards} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many 50-pack index cards are required.**\n\nEach pack contains 50 index cards. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of index cards by the number of index cards per pack:\n\\[ \\frac{1800 \\text{ index cards}}{50 \\text{ index cards/pack}} = 36 \\text{ packs} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the index cards.**\n\nEach 50-pack costs $3.
