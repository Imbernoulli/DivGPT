        "To determine how much money Betty and Paige will raise from their bake sale, we need to calculate the total number of each type of baked good they have baked and then multiply by the respective selling price.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of each type of baked good:\n\n1. **Chocolate chip cookies:**\n   - Betty baked 4 dozen chocolate chip cookies.\n   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, Betty baked \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) chocolate chip cookies.\n   - Paige baked 0 chocolate chip cookies.\n   - Total chocolate chip cookies: \\(48\\).\n\n2. **Oatmeal raisin cookies:**\n   - Betty baked 6 dozen oatmeal raisin cookies.\n   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, Betty baked \\(6 \\times 12 = 72\\) oatmeal raisin cookies.\n   - Paige baked 0 oatmeal raisin cookies.\n   - Total oatmeal raisin cookies: \\(72\\).\n\n3. **Regular brownies:**\n   - Betty baked 2 dozen regular brownies.\n   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 brownies, Betty baked \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) regular brownies.\n   - Paige baked 0 regular brownies.\n   - Total regular brownies: \\(24\\).\n\n4. **Sugar cookies:**\n   - Betty baked 0 sugar cookies.\n   - Paige baked 6 dozen sugar cookies.\n   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, Paige baked \\(6 \\times 12 = 72\\) sugar cookies.\n   - Total sugar cookies: \\(72\\).\n\n5. **Blondies:**\n   - Betty baked 0 blondies.\n   - Paige baked 3 dozen blondies.\n   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 blondies, Paige baked \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\) blondies.\n   - Total blondies: \\(36\\).\n\n6. **Cream cheese swirled brownies:**\n   - Betty baked 0 cream cheese swirled brownies.\n   - Paige baked 5 dozen cream cheese swirled brownies.\n   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 brownies, Paige baked \\(5 \\times 12 = 60\\) cream cheese swirled brownies.\n   - Total cream cheese swirled brownies: \\(60\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue from each type of baked good:\n\n1. **Revenue from chocolate chip cookies:**\n   - Total chocolate chip cookies: \\(48\\).\n   - Selling price per chocolate chip cookie: \\(\\$1.00\\).\n   - Revenue: \\(48 \\times 1 = 48\\) dollars.\n\n2. **Revenue from oatmeal raisin cookies:**\n   - Total oatmeal raisin cookies: \\(72\\).\n   - Selling price per oatmeal raisin cookie: \\(\\$1.00\\).\n   - Revenue: \\(72 \\times 1 = 72\\) dollars.\n\n3. **Revenue from regular brownies:**\n   - Total regular brownies: \\(24\\).\n   - Selling price per regular brownie: \\(\\$2.00\\).\n   - Revenue: \\(24 \\times 2 = 48\\) dollars.\n\n4. **Revenue from sugar cookies:**\n   - Total sugar cookies: \\(72\\).\n   - Selling price per sugar cookie: \\(\\$1.00\\).\n   - Revenue: \\(72 \\times 1 = 72\\) dollars.\n\n5. **Revenue from blondies:**\n   - Total blondies: \\(36\\).\n   - Selling price per blondie: \\(\\$2.00\\).\n   - Revenue: \\(36 \\times 2 = 72\\) dollars.\n\n6. **Revenue from cream cheese swirled brownies:**\n   - Total cream cheese swirled brownies: \\(60\\).\n   - Selling price per cream cheese swirled brownie: \\(\\$2.00\\).\n   - Revenue: \\(60 \\times 2 = 120\\) dollars.\n\nFinally, we sum up the total revenue from all the baked goods:\n\n\\[\n48 + 72 + 48 + 72 + 72 + 120 = 432\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Betty and Paige will raise is \\(\\boxed{432}\\) dollars.",
