        "To determine how many pounds Bobby added per year to his deadlift, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Bobby's deadlift at age 18.\n2. Determine the total increase in his deadlift from age 13 to age 18.\n3. Divide the total increase by the number of years (5 years) to find the annual increase.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Bobby's deadlift at age 18. According to the problem, at age 18 he can deadlift 100 pounds more than 250% of his previous deadlift (which was 300 pounds at age 13).\n\nFirst, calculate 250% of 300 pounds:\n\\[ 250\\% \\text{ of } 300 = 2.5 \\times 300 = 750 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, add 100 pounds to 750 pounds to find his deadlift at age 18:\n\\[ 750 + 100 = 850 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNow, determine the total increase in his deadlift from age 13 to age 18:\n\\[ 850 - 300 = 550 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nFinally, divide the total increase by the number of years (5 years) to find the annual increase:\n\\[ \\frac{550}{5} = 110 \\text{ pounds per year} \\]\n\nSo, the number of pounds Bobby added per year is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",
