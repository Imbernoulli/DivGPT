        "To determine how many pencils Mitchell and Antonio have together, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of pencils Mitchell has:**\n   Mitchell has 30 pencils.\n\n2. **Determine how many pencils Antonio has:**\n   Mitchell has 6 more pencils than Antonio. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   M = A + 6\n   \\]\n   where \\( M \\) is the number of pencils Mitchell has and \\( A \\) is the number of pencils Antonio has. Since \\( M = 30 \\), we substitute 30 for \\( M \\):\n   \\[\n   30 = A + 6\n   \\]\n   To find \\( A \\), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   A = 30 - 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A = 24\n   \\]\n   So, Antonio has 24 pencils.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of pencils Mitchell and Antonio have together:**\n   We add the number of pencils Mitchell has to the number of pencils Antonio has:\n   \\[\n   M + A = 30 + 24\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   M + A = 54\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pencils Mitchell and Antonio have together is \\boxed{54}.",
