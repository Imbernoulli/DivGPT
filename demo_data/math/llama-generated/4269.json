        "First, we determine how many puzzle pieces each son receives. Mrs. Young has a 300 piece puzzle set and divides it evenly among her three sons:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{3} = 100\n\\]\n\nEach son receives 100 pieces.\n\nNext, we calculate how many pieces each son places into the puzzle. Reyn places 25 pieces.

        "To determine how many puzzle pieces are still left to be placed, we start by calculating the number of pieces each son receives. Since Mrs. Young divides the 300 pieces evenly among her three sons, we divide 300 by 3:\n\n\\[\n300 \\div 3 = 100\n\\]\n\nSo, each son receives 100 pieces.\n\nNext, we calculate how many pieces each son places into the puzzle. Reyn places 25 pieces. Rhys places twice as many pieces as Reyn, which is:\n\n\\[\n25 \\times 2 = 50\n\\]\n\nRory places three times as many pieces as Reyn, which is:\n\n\\[\n25 \\times 3 = 75\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the total number of pieces placed by all three sons by adding the pieces each one places:\n\n\\[\n25 + 50 + 75 = 150\n\\]\n\nSince each son received 100 pieces, the total number of pieces they received together is:\n\n\\[\n100 + 100 + 100 = 300\n\\]\n\nTo find the number of pieces still left to be placed, we subtract the total number of pieces placed from the total number of pieces received:\n\n\\[\n300 - 150 = 150\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of puzzle pieces still left to be placed is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{150}\n\\]",

        "To determine how many puzzle pieces are still left to be placed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of puzzle pieces each son receives:**\n   Mrs. Young divides the 300 pieces evenly among her three sons.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{300}{3} = 100\n   \\]\n   So, each son receives 100 pieces.\n\n2. **Determine how many pieces each son places:**\n   - Reyn places 25 pieces.\n   - Rhys places twice as many pieces as Reyn:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 25 = 50\n     \\]\n   - Rory places three times as many pieces as Reyn:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 25 = 75\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of pieces placed by all three sons:**\n   Add the pieces placed by Reyn, Rhys, and Rory:\n   \\[\n   25 + 50 + 75 = 150\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many pieces are left to be placed:**\n   Subtract the total number of pieces placed from the total number of pieces initially:\n   \\[\n   300 - 150 = 150\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of puzzle pieces still left to be placed is \\boxed{150}."
