Subtract the total number of sessions required by the first and second patients from the overall total number of sessions to find out how many sessions are needed by the remaining patients.\n\nLet's start with the first patient. The first patient needs 6 sessions.\n\nNext, we know that the second patient needs 5 more sessions than the first patient. Therefore, the second patient needs:\n\\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \\text{ sessions} \\]\n\nNow, we add the sessions required by the first and second patients to find out how many sessions they need together:\n\\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \\text{ sessions} \\]\n\nThe total number of sessions needed by all four patients is 25. Therefore, the number of sessions needed by the remaining two patients is:\n\\[ 25 - 17 = 8 \\text{ sessions} \\]\n\nSo, the remaining patients need \\(\\boxed{8}\\) sessions.",
