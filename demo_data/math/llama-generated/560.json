        "To determine how many pages Berry needs to read on Saturday to reach his goal of an average of 50 pages per day for the week, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pages Berry needs to read for the week:**\n   Since the goal is to read an average of 50 pages per day over 7 days, we multiply the average by the number of days:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ pages/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 350 \\text{ pages}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum the number of pages Berry has already read:**\n   We add up the pages read from Sunday to Friday:\n   \\[\n   43 \\text{ pages} + 65 \\text{ pages} + 28 \\text{ pages} + 0 \\text{ pages} + 70 \\text{ pages} + 56 \\text{ pages}\n   \\]\n   Let's add these step by step:\n   \\[\n   43 + 65 = 108\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   108 + 28 = 136\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   136 + 0 = 136\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   136 + 70 = 206\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   206 + 56 = 262\n   \\]\n   So, Berry has read a total of 262 pages so far.\n\n3. **Determine how many more pages Berry needs to read:**\n   We subtract the total pages already read from the total pages needed:\n   \\[\n   350 \\text{ pages} - 262 \\text{ pages} = 88 \\text{ pages}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Berry needs to read \\(\\boxed{88}\\) pages on Saturday to reach his goal.",

Determine how many more pages Berry needs to read on Saturday to meet his goal.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages Berry should have read in the week.**\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week and he wants to read an average of 50 pages per day, we multiply the number of days by the average number of pages per day:\n\\[ 7 \\times 50 = 350 \\]\nSo, Berry should have read 350 pages in total for the week.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of pages Berry has already read from Sunday to Friday.**\n\nWe add up the pages he read each day:\n\\[ 43 + 65 + 28 + 0 + 70 + 56 \\]\nLet's add these step by step:\n\\[ 43 + 65 = 108 \\]\n\\[ 108 + 28 = 136 \\]\n\\[ 136 + 0 = 136 \\]\n\\[ 136 + 70 = 206 \\]\n\\[ 206 + 56 = 262 \\]\nSo, Berry has already read 262 pages from Sunday to Friday.\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many more pages Berry needs to read on Saturday to meet his goal.**\n\nWe subtract the total number of pages he has already read from the total number of pages he should have read:\n\\[ 350 - 262 = 88 \\]\nSo, Berry needs to read \\(\\boxed{88}\\) pages on Saturday to reach his goal.",
