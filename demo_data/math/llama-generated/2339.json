We know that Zig wrote 60 books. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Flo wrote:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of books Flo wrote} = \\frac{\\text{Number of books Zig wrote}}{4} = \\frac{60}{4} = 15 \\]\n\nNow that we know Flo wrote 15 books, we can find the total number of books written by both Zig and Flo by adding the number of books each wrote:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of books} = \\text{Number of books Zig wrote} + \\text{Number of books Flo wrote} = 60 + 15 = 75 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of books written by Zig and Flo altogether is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{75} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of books written by Zig and Flo, we start by identifying the number of books each person wrote. We know from the problem statement that Zig wrote four times as many books as Flo. Let's denote the number of books Flo wrote as \\( F \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, Zig wrote 60 books. Therefore, we can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\\[ 60 = 4F \\]\n\nTo find \\( F \\), we need to solve the equation for \\( F \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[ F = \\frac{60}{4} = 15 \\]\n\nSo, Flo wrote 15 books. Now, to find the total number of books written by both Zig and Flo, we add the number of books each wrote:\n\\[ 60 + 15 = 75 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of books written by Zig and Flo is \\(\\boxed{75}\\).",
