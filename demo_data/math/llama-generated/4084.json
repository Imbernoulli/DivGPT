        "To determine how many 400-ml bottles of dye Jenna needs to buy, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of dots needed for 100 blouses:**\n   Each blouse gets 20 dots, and there are 100 blouses.\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ dots/blouse} \\times 100 \\text{ blouses} = 2000 \\text{ dots}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of dye needed for 2000 dots:**\n   Each dot takes 10 ml of dye.\n   \\[\n   2000 \\text{ dots} \\times 10 \\text{ ml/dot} = 20000 \\text{ ml}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many 400-ml bottles are required to get 20000 ml of dye:**\n   Each bottle contains 400 ml of dye.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20000 \\text{ ml}}{400 \\text{ ml/bottle}} = 50 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jenna needs to buy \\(\\boxed{50}\\) bottles of dye.",
        "To determine how many 400-ml bottles of dye Jenna needs to buy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of dots needed for 100 blouses.\n2. Determine the total amount of dye required based on the number of dots.\n3. Calculate how many 400-ml bottles are needed to provide the total amount of dye.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of dots needed for 100 blouses. Since each blouse gets 20 dots, we multiply the number of blouses by the number of dots per blouse:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ blouses} \\times 20 \\text{ dots per blouse} = 2000 \\text{ dots} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the total amount of dye required. Since each dot takes 10 ml of dye, we multiply the total number of dots by the amount of dye per dot:\n\\[ 2000 \\text{ dots} \\times 10 \\text{ ml per dot} = 20000 \\text{ ml of dye} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate how many 400-ml bottles are needed to provide 20000 ml of dye. We do this by dividing the total amount of dye by the volume of each bottle:\n\\[ 20000 \\text{ ml} \\div 400 \\text{ ml per bottle} = 50 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jenna needs to buy \\(\\boxed{50}\\) bottles of dye.",
