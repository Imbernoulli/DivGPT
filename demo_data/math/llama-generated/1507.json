Since he invited twice as many people from his school as from his hometown, we have:\n\\[ \\text{People from school} = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of people invited from Martin's sports club. The number of people invited from his sports club is equal to the sum of the people invited from his hometown and his school:\n\\[ \\text{People from sports club} = 5 + 10 = 15 \\]\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of invitations from his hometown, school, and sports club:\n\\[ \\text{Total from hometown, school, and sports club} = 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 \\]\n\nThe remaining invitations represent 20% of the total previously mentioned. Therefore, the number of remaining invitations is:\n\\[ \\text{Remaining invitations} = 0.20 \\times 30 = 6 \\]\n\nFinally, the total number of invitations is the sum of the invitations from his hometown, school, sports club, and the remaining invitations:\n\\[ \\text{Total invitations} = 30 + 6 = 36 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of people who can potentially come to the party Martin is organizing is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
