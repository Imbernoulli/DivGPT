        "To determine the total time Kira takes to travel from the first station to the third station, we need to consider both the travel time between the stations and the break she takes.\n\n1. **Travel Time Between Stations:**\n   - The distance between each pair of stations is 2 hours.\n   - Kira travels from the first station to the second station, which takes 2 hours.\n   - Kira then travels from the second station to the third station, which also takes 2 hours.\n\n   Therefore, the total travel time between the first and third station is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Break Time:**\n   - Kira takes a 30-minute break at the second station.\n\n   Therefore, the total break time is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Time:**\n   - To find the total time Kira takes to travel from the first station to the third station, we add the travel time and the break time.\n   - First, convert the travel time from hours to minutes:\n     \\[\n     4 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Then, add the break time:\n     \\[\n     240 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 270 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total time Kira takes to travel between the first and third station is \\(\\boxed{270}\\) minutes.",
