Since each friend saw an average of 10 alligators, and there are three friends, we multiply the average by the number of friends:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ alligators/friend} \\times 3 \\text{ friends} = 30 \\text{ alligators} \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of alligators seen by Samara to the number seen by her friends. Samara saw 20 alligators, so we add 20 to 30:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ alligators} + 30 \\text{ alligators} = 50 \\text{ alligators} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of alligators Samara and her friends saw is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
