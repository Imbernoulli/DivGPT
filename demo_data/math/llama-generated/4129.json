        "To determine the number of lemons, we start by identifying the total number of fruits and the number of fruits in each basket. The total number of fruits is 58. The number of mangoes is 18, the number of pears is 10, and the number of pawpaws is 12. Let's denote the number of kiwis as \\( k \\) and the number of lemons as \\( l \\). According to the problem, the number of kiwis is the same as the number of lemons, so \\( k = l \\).\n\nWe can set up the following equation to represent the total number of fruits:\n\\[\n18 + 10 + 12 + k + l = 58\n\\]\nSince \\( k = l \\), we can substitute \\( l \\) for \\( k \\) in the equation:\n\\[\n18 + 10 + 12 + l + l = 58\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n18 + 10 + 12 + 2l = 58\n\\]\nNext, we combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n40 + 2l = 58\n\\]\nTo isolate \\( 2l \\), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n2l = 18\n\\]\nThen, we solve for \\( l \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[\nl = 9\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of lemons is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
        "To determine the number of lemons, we start by calculating the total number of fruits in the three baskets that contain mangoes, pears, and pawpaws. The number of mangoes is 18, the number of pears is 10, and the number of pawpaws is 12. Adding these together, we get:\n\n\\[ 18 + 10 + 12 = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total number of fruits in these three baskets from the overall total number of fruits to find the combined number of kiwis and lemons. The total number of fruits is 58, so we have:\n\n\\[ 58 - 40 = 18 \\]\n\nSince the last two baskets contain the same number of kiwis and lemons, we divide the combined number of kiwis and lemons by 2:\n\n\\[ 18 \\div 2 = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of lemons is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",

Let the number of kiwis be \\( k \\) and the number of lemons be \\( k \\) (since they are the same).\n\nWe can set up the following equation to represent the total number of fruits:\n\\[\n18 + 10 + 12 + k + k = 58\n\\]\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\n40 + 2k = 58\n\\]\nNext, we isolate \\( 2k \\) by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n2k = 18\n\\]\nThen, we solve for \\( k \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[\nk = 9\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of lemons is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
