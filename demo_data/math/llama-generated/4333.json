Subtract the number of Snickers and Mars bars from the total number of candy bars to find the number of Butterfingers.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- Mark has 12 candy bars in total.\n- Mark has 3 Snickers.\n- Mark has 2 Mars bars.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of Snickers and Mars bars:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ Snickers} + 2 \\text{ Mars bars} = 5 \\text{ candy bars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of Snickers and Mars bars from the total number of candy bars to find the number of Butterfingers:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ total candy bars} - 5 \\text{ candy bars} = 7 \\text{ Butterfingers} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of Butterfingers Mark has is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."
