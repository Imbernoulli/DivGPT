        "Let's start by defining the time Juan takes to grab his lunch and return to his office as \\( T_{\\text{lunch}} \\). According to the problem, this time is half the time he takes to read a book. So, if we let \\( T_{\\text{book}} \\) be the time he takes to read the book, we have:\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{lunch}} = \\frac{1}{2} T_{\\text{book}} \\]\n\nWe are given that Juan takes 4 hours to move from his office to grab lunch. Since_dense move back to his office, the total time for lunch is:\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{lunch}} = 4 + 4 = 8 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute \\( T_{\\text{lunch}} = 8 \\) into the equation \\( T_{\\text{lunch}} = \\frac{1}{2} T_{\\text{book}} \\):\n\n\\[ 8 = \\frac{1}{2} T_{\\text{book}} \\]\n\nTo find \\( T_{\\text{book}} \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{book}} = 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThis means Juan takes 16 hours to read a 4000-page book. To find out how many pages he reads in one hour, we divide the total number of pages by the total time taken:\n\n\\[ \\text{Pages per hour} = \\frac{4000 \\text{ pages}}{16 \\text{ hours}} = 250 \\text{ pages per hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pages Juan reads in an hour is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",
