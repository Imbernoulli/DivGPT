        "To determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we need to find out how many marbles Katrina has and then use that information to find out how many marbles Amanda has.\n\nFirst, we know that Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. Since Mabel has 85 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Katrina has by dividing 85 by 5:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of marbles Katrina has} = \\frac{85}{5} = 17\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. If Katrina has 17 marbles, then twice as many marbles as Katrina would be:\n\\[\n2 \\times 17 = 34\n\\]\nSince Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have 34 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Amanda has by subtracting 12 from 34:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of marbles Amanda has} = 34 - 12 = 22\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda. Since Mabel has 85 marbles and Amanda has 22 marbles, we subtract the number of marbles Amanda has from the number of marbles Mabel has:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 85 - 22 = 63\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mabel has \\(\\boxed{63}\\) more marbles than Amanda.",
        "To determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of marbles Katrina has:**\n   Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. Given that Mabel has 85 marbles, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   5k = 85\n   \\]\n   where \\( k \\) is the number of marbles Katrina has. Solving for \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{85}{5} = 17\n   \\]\n   So, Katrina has 17 marbles.\n\n2. **Determine the number of marbles Amanda has:**\n   Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. We can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   a + 12 = 2k\n   \\]\n   where \\( a \\) is the number of marbles Amanda has. Substituting \\( k = 17 \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   a + 12 = 2 \\times 17 = 34\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   a = 34 - 12 = 22\n   \\]\n   So, Amanda has 22 marbles.\n\n3. **Determine how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda:**\n   Mabel has 85 marbles, and Amanda has 22 marbles. The difference is:\n   \\[\n   85 - 22 = 63\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mabel has \\(\\boxed{63}\\) more marbles than Amanda.",
        "Let's denote the number of marbles Katrina has as \\( k \\). According to the problem, Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. Since Mabel has 85 marbles, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n5k = 85\n\\]\nTo find \\( k \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\\[\nk = \\frac{85}{5} = 17\n\\]\nSo, Katrina has 17 marbles. Next, we need to determine how many marbles Amanda has. The problem states that Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. This can be expressed as:\n\\[\na + 12 = 2k\n\\]\nSince \\( k = 17 \\), we substitute 17 for \\( k \\) in the equation:\n\\[\na + 12 = 2 \\times 17\n\\]\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\na + 12 = 34\n\\]\nTo find \\( a \\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\na = 34 - 12 = 22\n\\]\nSo, Amanda has 22 marbles. Now, we need to find out how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda. Since Mabel has 85 marbles and Amanda has 22 marbles, we calculate the difference as follows:\n\\[\n85 - 22 = 63\n\\]\nTherefore, Mabel has \\(\\boxed{63}\\) more marbles than Amanda.",
