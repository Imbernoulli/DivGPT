        "To determine how much Gordon will spend on books after the discounts, we need to calculate the discount for each book individually and then sum up the discounted prices.\n\nFirst, let's identify which books are eligible for the 30% discount (books over $22.00) and which books are eligible for the 20% discount (books under $20.00).\n\n- The book priced at $25.00 is over $22.00, so it gets a 30% discount.\n- The book priced at $18.00 is under $20.00, so it gets a 20% discount.\n- The book priced at $21.00 is between $20.00 and $22.00, so it does not qualify for any discount.\n- The book priced at $35.00 is over $22.00, so it gets a 30% discount.\n- The book priced at $12.00 is under $20.00, so it gets a 20% discount.\n- The book priced at $10.00 is under $20.00, so it gets a 20% discount.\n\nNow, let's calculate the discounted price for each book:\n\n1. For the $25.00 book:\n   \\[\n   25.00 \\times (1 - 0.30) = 25.00 \\times 0.70 = 17.50\n   \\]\n\n2. For the $18.00 book:\n   \\[\n   18.00 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 18.00 \\times 0.80 = 14.40\n   \\]\n\n3. For the $21.00 book:\n   \\[\n   21.00 \\times 1 = 21.00\n   \\]\n\n4. For the $35.00 book:\n   \\[\n   35.00 \\times (1 - 0.30) = 35.00 \\times 0.70 = 24.50\n   \\]\n\n5. For the $12.00 book:\n   \\[\n   12.00 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 12.00 \\times 0.80 = 9.60\n   \\]\n\n6. For the $10.00 book:\n   \\[\n   10.00 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 10.00 \\times 0.80 = 8.00\n   \\]\n\nNext, we sum up the discounted prices:\n\\[\n17.50 + 14.40 + 21.00 + 24.50 + 9.60 + 8.00\n\\]\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\\[\n17.50 + 14.40 = 31.90\n\\]\n\\[\n31.90 + 21.00 = 52.90\n\\]\n\\[\n52.90 + 24.50 = 77.40\n\\]\n\\[\n77.40 + 9.60 = 87.00\n\\]\n\\[\n87.00 + 8.00 = 95.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Gordon will spend \\(\\boxed{95.00}\\) dollars on books.",
