        "To determine the difference in the bookstore's earnings on \"TOP\" and \"ABC\" books last week, we need to calculate the total earnings from each book separately and then find the difference between these two amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total earnings from the \"TOP\" books. The cost of one \"TOP\" book is $8, and 13 \"TOP\" books were sold. Therefore, the total earnings from the \"TOP\" books is:\n\\[ 13 \\times 8 = 104 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total earnings from the \"ABC\" books.
