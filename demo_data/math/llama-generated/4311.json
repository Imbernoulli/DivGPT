Since they want to leave a 20% tip, we calculate 20% of the total cost of the meal:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 60 = 12 \\]\nSo, the total tip amount is $12.\n\nFinally, we need to divide the total tip amount evenly among the three people. To find out how much each person should pay, we divide $12 by 3:\n\\[ 12 \\div 3 = 4 \\]\nSo, each person should pay $4 in tips.\n\nTherefore, the amount each should pay in tips is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
