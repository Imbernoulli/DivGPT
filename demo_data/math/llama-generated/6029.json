The discount amount is:\n\\[\n150 - 135 = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the discount as a fraction of the original price. The discount amount is $15, and the original price is $150. So, the fraction of the discount is:\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{150}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15:\n\\[\n\\frac{15 \\div 15}{150 \\div 15} = \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\nNow, we convert the fraction \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) to a percentage. To do this, we multiply the fraction by 100:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10} \\times 100 = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percent discount is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",
        "To determine the percent discount on the bag, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of the discount:**\n   The original price of the bag was $150, and the sale price is $135.
