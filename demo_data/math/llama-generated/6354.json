        "To determine how many students the library can help on the fourth day of school, we need to calculate the total number of books itertools out on the first three days and then find out how many books are left. Each student requires 5 books.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of books itertools out on each of the first three days:\n- On the first day, 4 students each need 5 books, so the library itertools out \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\) books.\n- On the second day, 5 students each need 5 books, so the library itertools out \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) books.\n- On the third day, 6 students each need 5 books, so the library itertools out \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\) books.\n\nNext, we sum the number of books itertools out over the first three days:\n\\[20 + 25 + 30 = 75\\]\n\nThe library initially had 120 books, so the number of books left after the first three days is:\n\\[120 - 75 = 45\\]\n\nSince each student needs 5 books, the number of students the library can help on the fourth day is:\n\\[45 \\div 5 = 9\\]\n\nTherefore, the library can help out \\(\\boxed{9}\\) students on the fourth day of school.",
