        "To determine how much water is in Rory's tank at the end of the heavy rainstorm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial amount of water in the tank.\n2. Calculate the total amount of water that flows into the tank during the rainstorm.\n3. Add the initial amount of water to the amount of water that flows into the tank.\n\nFirst, let's identify the initial amount of water in the tank:\n\\[ \\text{Initial amount of water} = 100 \\text{ L} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of water that flows into the tank during the rainstorm. The rate of water flow is 2 L/min, and the duration of the rainstorm is 90 minutes. Therefore, the total amount of water that flows into the tank is:\n\\[ \\text{Total water flow} = \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Time} = 2 \\text{ L/min} \\times 90 \\text{ min} = 180 \\text{ L} \\]\n\nNow, we add the initial amount of water to the total amount of water that flows into the tank to find the final amount of water in the tank:\n\\[ \\text{Final amount of water} = \\text{Initial amount of water} + \\text{Total water flow} = 100 \\text{ L} + 180 \\text{ L} = 280 \\text{ L} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of water in the tank at the end of the heavy rain is:\n\\[ \\boxed{280} \\]",
