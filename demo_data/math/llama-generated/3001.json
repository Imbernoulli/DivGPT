        "To determine how much more money Connor needs to spend to receive free shipping, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books after applying the discount.\n\nThe cost of Book 1 is $13.00 and it is 25% off, so the discount on Book 1 is:\n\\[ 13.00 \\times 0.25 = 3.25 \\]\nTherefore, the cost of Book 1 after the discount is:\n\\[ 13.00 - 3.25 = 9.75 \\]\n\nThe cost of Book 2 is $15.00 and it is 25% off, so the discount on Book 2 is:\n\\[ 15.00 \\times 0.25 = 3.75 \\]\nTherefore, the cost of Book 2 after the discount is:\n\\[ 15.00 - 3.75 = 11.25 \\]\n\nThe cost of Book 3 is $10.00 and there is no discount, so the cost of Book 3 is:\n\\[ 10.00 \\]\n\nThe cost of Book 4 is $10.00 and there is no discount, so the cost of Book 4 is:\n\\[ 10.00 \\]\n\nNow, we add up the costs of all four books to find the total cost:\n\\[ 9.75 + 11.25 + 10.00 + 10.00 = 41.00 \\]\n\nConnor wants to receive free shipping, which requires a total purchase of at least $50.00.

        "To determine how much more money Connor needs to spend to receive free shipping, we need to calculate the total cost of the books after applying the discount and then find out how much more is needed to reach the $50.00 threshold.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discount on the first two books:\n- Book 1 costs $13.00, and it is 25% off. So, the discount on Book 1 is:\n  \\[\n  13.00 \\times 0.25 = 3.25\n  \\]\n  Therefore, the price of Book 1 after the discount is:\n  \\[\n  13.00 - 3.25 = 9.75\n  \\]\n\n- Book 2 costs $15.00, and it is 25% off. So, the discount on Book 2 is:\n  \\[\n  15.00 \\times 0.25 = 3.75\n  \\]\n  Therefore, the price of Book 2 after the discount is:\n  \\[\n  15.00 - 3.75 = 11.25\n  \\]\n\nNext, we add the prices of Book 3 and Book 4, which are not discounted:\n- Book 3 costs $10.00.\n- Book 4 costs $10.00.\n\nSo, the total cost of Book 3 and Book 4 is:\n\\[\n10.00 + 10.00 = 20.00\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the discounted prices of Book 1 and Book 2 to the total cost of Book 3 and Book 4 to get the total cost of all four books:\n\\[\n9.75 + 11.25 + 20.00 = 41.00\n\\]\n\nConnor wants to receive free shipping, which requires a total花费 of $50.00. Therefore, we need to find out how much more money Connor needs to spend:\n\\[\n50.00 - 41.00 = 9.00\n\\]\n\nThus, Connor needs to spend \\boxed{9.00} more dollars to receive free shipping.",
