        "To determine how many zoology books Milton has, we start by defining the variables. Let \\( z \\) represent the number of zoology books. According to the problem, Milton has 4 times as many books about botany as he does about zoology. Therefore, the number of botany books is \\( 4z \\).\n\nThe total number of books Milton has is the sum of the zoology books and the botany books.
