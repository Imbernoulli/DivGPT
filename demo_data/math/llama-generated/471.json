        "To determine the total number of math problems Marvin and Arvin have practiced, we start by finding out how many problems Marvin practiced today and yesterday.\n\nFirst, we know that Marvin solved 40 math problems yesterday. According to the problem, the number of math problems Marvin practiced today is three times as many as the number of problems he solved yesterday. Therefore, we calculate the number of problems Marvin practiced today as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\times 40 = 120\n\\]\nSo, Marvin practiced 120 math problems today.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many math problems Arvin practiced over the two days. Since Arvin has practiced twice as many math problems on each day as Marvin, we calculate the number of problems Arvin practiced yesterday as:\n\\[\n2 \\times 40 = 80\n\\]\nAnd the number of problems Arvin practiced today is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 120 = 240\n\\]\nSo, Arvin practiced 80 math problems yesterday and 240 math problems today. To find the total number of problems Arvin practiced over the two days, we add these two amounts together:\n\\[\n80 + 240 = 320\n\\]\nNow, we add the total number of problems Marvin practiced over the two days to the total number of problems Arvin practiced over the two days to get the overall total:\n\\[\n120 + 40 + 240 + 80 = 480\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of math problems Marvin and Arvin have practiced altogether is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{480}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of math problems Marvin and Arvin have practiced altogether, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of problems Marvin practiced today:**\n   Marvin practiced three times as many problems today as he did yesterday. Given that Marvin solved 40 problems yesterday, we can find the number of problems he practiced today by multiplying 40 by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Problems Marvin practiced today} = 3 \\times 40 = 120\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of problems Marvin practiced over the two days:**\n   Marvin practiced 40 problems yesterday and 120 problems today. Adding these together gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total problems Marvin practiced} = 40 + 120 = 160\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of problems Arvin practiced each day:**\n   Arvin practiced twice as many problems as Marvin each day. Therefore, we need to multiply the number of problems Marvin practiced each day by 2.\n   - problems Arvin practiced yesterday:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Problems Arvin practiced yesterday} = 2 \\times 40 = 80\n     \\]\n   - problems Arvin practiced today:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Problems Arvin practiced today} = 2 \\times 120 = 240\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of problems Arvin practiced over the two days:**\n   Arvin practiced 80 problems yesterday and 240 problems today. Adding these together gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total problems Arvin practiced} = 80 + 240 = 320\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of problems both Marvin and Arvin practiced altogether:**\n   Adding the total number of problems Marvin practiced to the total number of problems Arvin practiced gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total problems practiced altogether} = 160 + 320 = 480\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of math problems Marvin and Arvin have practiced altogether is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",

The total number of math problems Marvin practiced over the two days is:\n\\[\n40 + 120 = 160\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Arvin has practiced twice as many math problems on each day as Marvin. Therefore, the number of math problems Arvin practiced yesterday is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 40 = 80\n\\]\nAnd the number of math problems Arvin practiced today is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 120 = 240\n\\]\nSo, the total number of math problems Arvin practiced over the two days is:\n\\[\n80 + 240 = 320\n\\]\n\nFinally, to find the total number of math problems Marvin and Arvin have practiced altogether, we add their total numbers:\n\\[\n160 + 320 = 480\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of math problems they have practiced altogether is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{480}\n\\]",

Since Marvin solved 40 math problems yesterday, we can calculate the number of problems he practiced today as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\times 40 = 120\n\\]\nSo, Marvin practiced 120 math problems today.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of math problems Marvin practiced over the two days:\n\\[\n40 + 120 = 160\n\\]\n Marvin practiced a total of 160 math problems.\n\nNow, we calculate how many math problems Arvin practiced. According to the problem, Arvin practiced twice as many problems on each day as Marvin did. Therefore, we first find out how many problems Arvin practiced yesterday:\n\\[\n2 \\times 40 = 80\n\\]\nSo, Arvin practiced 80 math problems yesterday.\n\nNext, we find out how many problems Arvin practiced today:\n\\[\n2 \\times 120 = 240\n\\]\nSo, Arvin practiced 240 math problems today.\n\nThen, we calculate the total number of math problems Arvin practiced over the two days:\n\\[\n80 + 240 = 320\n\\]\n Arvin practiced a total of 320 math problems.\n\nFinally, we find the total number of math problems both Marvin and Arvin practiced together by adding their individual totals:\n\\[\n160 + 320 = 480\n\\]\nSo, the total number of math problems they have practiced altogether is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{480}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of math problems Marvin and Arvin have practiced altogether, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of problems Marvin practiced today:**\n   Marvin practiced three times as many problems today as he did yesterday. Given that Marvin solved 40 problems yesterday, we can calculate:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 40 = 120\n   \\]\n   So, Marvin practiced 120 problems today.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of problems Marvin practiced over the two days:**\n   Marvin solved 40 problems yesterday and 120 problems today.
