        "To determine how many more points the Fredingo Fireflies scored in the game than the Dunkinville Hornets, we need to calculate the points each team scored in the remaining 40 seconds and then find the difference between these scores.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the points scored by the Fireflies in the last 40 seconds. The Fireflies scored 7 three-point baskets. Since each three-point basket is worth 3 points, we multiply the number of three-point baskets by 3:\n\\[\n7 \\times 3 = 21\n\\]\nSo, the Fireflies scored 21 points in the last 40 seconds.\n\nNext, let's calculate the points scored by the Hornets in the last 40 seconds. The Hornets scored 2 two-point baskets. Since each two-point basket is worth 2 points, we multiply the number of two-point baskets by 2:\n\\[\n2 \\times 2 = 4\n\\]\nSo, the Hornets scored 4 points in the last 40 seconds.\n\nNow, we add the points scored by each team in the last 40 seconds to their initial scores. The initial score of the Fireflies was 74, so their final score is:\n\\[\n74 + 21 = 95\n\\]\nThe initial score of the Hornets was 86, so their final score is:\n\\[\n86 + 4 = 90\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the final scores of the Fireflies and the Hornets:\n\\[\n95 - 90 = 5\n\\]\nSo, the Fireflies scored 5 more points in the game than the Hornets. The answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
