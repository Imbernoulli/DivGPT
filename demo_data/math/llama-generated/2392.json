Therefore, the total number of panels required is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 10 = 200 \\text{ panels} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many panels the supplier actually brought.**\n\nThe supplier brought 50 panels less than the required amount. Therefore, the number of panels the supplier brought is:\n\\[ 200 - 50 = 150 \\text{ panels} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many homes can be fully equipped with the panels.**\n\nEach home needs 10 panels, so the number of homes that can be fully equ施策 with 150 panels is:\n\\[ \\frac{150}{10} = 15 \\text{ homes} \\]\n\nThus, the number of homes that had their panels installed is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]",
