        "To determine the total weight Tom was moving with, we need to consider the weight he was holding in each hand and the weight of the vest he was wearing.\n\nFirst, we calculate the weight Tom was holding in each hand. Since he was holding 1.5 times his weight in each hand, we multiply his weight by 1.5:\n\\[ 150 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 1.5 = 225 \\, \\text{kg} \\]\nSo, he was holding 225 kg in each hand. Since he has two hands, the total weight he was holding in both hands is:\n\\[ 225 \\, \\text{kg} + 225 \\, \\text{kg} = 450 \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the weight of the vest. The vest weighs half of Tom's weight, so we multiply his weight by 0.5:\n\\[ 150 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 0.5 = 75 \\, \\text{kg} \\]\nSo, the vest weighs 75 kg.\n\nTo find the total weight Tom was moving with, we add the weight he was holding in both hands to the weight of the vest:\n\\[ 450 \\, \\text{kg} + 75 \\, \\text{kg} = 525 \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight Tom was moving with is:\n\\[ \\boxed{525} \\]",
