        "Let's denote the speed of the son as \\( v \\) meters per second.

During this time, the son will have walked a distance of \\( vt \\) meters, and the father will have walked a distance of \\( 3vt \\) meters. The sum of the distances they have walked will be equal to the total length of the hallway, which is 16 meters. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ vt + 3vt = 16 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ 4vt = 16 \\]\n\nTo find \\( t \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4v:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{16}{4v} = \\frac{4}{v} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the distance from the father's end of the hallway to the point where they meet. This distance is the distance the father has walked, which is \\( 3vt \\).
