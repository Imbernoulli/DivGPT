Since there are 20 cats now, the number of dogs is \\( 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\).\n\nWe can set up the following equation based on the information given:\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{2} + 20 = 40\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( c \\), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{2} = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \\( c \\):\n\\[\nc = 40\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the original number of cats in the neighborhood was \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",

Since there are 20 cats now, we can write:\n\n\\[ D + 20 = 2 \\times 20 \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ D + 20 = 40 \\]\n\nTo find the original number of dogs \\( D \\), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ D = 40 - 20 \\]\n\\[ D = 20 \\]\n\nNow, we know that the original number of dogs was 20. Using the first equation \\( D = \\frac{C}{2} \\), we substitute \\( D = 20 \\) into it:\n\n\\[ 20 = \\frac{C}{2} \\]\n\nTo find the original number of cats \\( C \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[ C = 20 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ C = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the original number of cats in the neighborhood was \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
        "Let's denote the original number of cats in the neighborhood as \\( c \\). According to the problem, the original number of dogs was half the number of cats, so we can express the original number of dogs as \\( \\frac{c}{2} \\).\n\nAfter twenty new dogs were born, the number of dogs became \\( \\frac{c}{2} + 20 \\). The problem states that now there are twice as many dogs as cats. Since there are 20 cats now, the number of dogs is \\( 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{2} + 20 = 40\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( c \\), we first isolate \\( \\frac{c}{2} \\) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{2} = 40 - 20\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{2} = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( c \\) by multiplying both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nc = 20 \\times 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nc = 40\n\\]\n\nThus, the original number of cats in the neighborhood was \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
