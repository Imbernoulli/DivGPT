        "To determine the number of female guests at Princeton's gender reveal party, we start by calculating the number of male guests. According to the problem, 2/3 of the total number of guests were male. The total number of guests is 60. Therefore, the number of male guests is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of male guests} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 60\n\\]\n\nWe perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 60 = \\frac{2 \\times 60}{3} = \\frac{120}{3} = 40\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 40 male guests. Since the total number of guests is 60, the number of female guests is the total number of guests minus the number of male guests:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of female guests} = 60 - 40 = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of female guests who attended the party is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",

Therefore, we calculate the number of male guests as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of male guests} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 60\n\\]\n\nWe perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 60 = \\frac{2 \\times 60}{3} = \\frac{120}{3} = 40\n\\]\n\nSo, there were 40 male guests. To find the number of female guests, we subtract the number of male guests from the total number of guests:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of female guests} = 60 - 40 = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of female guests who attended the party is \\boxed{20}.",
        "To determine the number of female guests at Princeton's gender reveal party, we start by calculating the number of male guests. We know that 2/3 of the total number of guests were male. The total number of guests is 60. Therefore, we can find the number of male guests by multiplying 60 by 2/3:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of male guests} = 60 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 60 \\times 0.6667 = 40\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 40 male guests. To find the number of female guests, we subtract the number of male guests from the total number of guests:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of female guests} = 60 - 40 = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of female guests who attended the party is \\boxed{20}."
