        "To determine the total number of white-spotted mushrooms Bill and Ted gathered, we need to calculate the number of white-spotted mushrooms from each type separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of white-spotted brown mushrooms. Bill gathered 6 brown mushrooms, and all of them have white spots:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ brown mushrooms} \\times 1 = 6 \\text{ white-spotted brown mushrooms}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of white-spotted red mushrooms. Bill gathered 12 red mushrooms, and two-thirds of them have white spots:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ red mushrooms} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 8 \\text{ white-spotted red mushrooms}\n\\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the number of white-spotted blue mushrooms. Ted gathered 6 blue mushrooms, and half of them have white spots:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ blue mushrooms} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3 \\text{ white-spotted blue mushrooms}\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the number of white-spotted green mushrooms. Ted gathered 14 green mushrooms, and none of them have white spots:\n\\[\n14 \\text{ green mushrooms} \\times 0 = 0 \\text{ white-spotted green mushrooms}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum up all the white-spotted mushrooms:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ white-spotted brown mushrooms} + 8 \\text{ white-spotted red mushrooms} + 3 \\text{ white-spotted blue mushrooms} + 0 \\text{ white-spotted green mushrooms} = 17 \\text{ white-spotted mushrooms}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of white-spotted mushrooms they gathered is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",
