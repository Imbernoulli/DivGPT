        "To determine the total number of rose bouquets sold over the three-day sale, we need to calculate the number of bouquets sold each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many bouquets were sold on Tuesday. According to the problem, they sold three times as many bouquets on Tuesday as they did on Monday. Since they sold 12 bouquets on Monday, we calculate:\n\\[ 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\]\nSo, they sold 36 bouquets on Tuesday.\n\nNext, let's find out how many bouquets were sold on Wednesday. The problem states that they sold a third of what they sold on Tuesday. Since they sold 36 bouquets on Tuesday, we calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{36}{3} = 12 \\]\nSo, they sold 12 bouquets on Wednesday.\n\nNow, we sum up the number of bouquets sold on each day to find the total number of bouquets sold over the three days:\n\\[ 12 + 36 + 12 = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of bouquets sold during the three-day sale is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
