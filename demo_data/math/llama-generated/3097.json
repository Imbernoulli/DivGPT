Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n3x + 2x = 100\n\\]\nCombining the terms on the left side, we get:\n\\[\n5x = 100\n\\]\nTo find the value of \\(x\\), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{100}{5} = 20\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\(x\\), we can find the number of boys and the number of girls. The number of boys is:\n\\[\n3x = 3 \\times 20 = 60\n\\]\nThe number of girls is:\n\\[\n2x = 2 \\times 20 = 40\n\\]\n\nTo find how many more boys than girls there are, we subtract the number of girls from the number of boys:\n\\[\n60 - 40 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are \\(\\boxed{20}\\) more boys than girls.",

Since each group of 5 students contains 2 girls, the total number of girls is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of girls} = 2 \\times 20 = 40\n\\]\n\nTo find out how many more boys than girls there are, we subtract the number of girls from the number of boys:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 60 - 40 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are \\boxed{20} more boys than girls.",
        "To determine how many more boys than girls there are in a class of 100 students with a boy-to-girl ratio of 3:2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the ratio**: The ratio 3:2 means for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls. Therefore, the total number of parts in the ratio is \\(3 + 2 = 5\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of boys**: Since the total number of students is 100, we can find the number of boys by determining what fraction of the total number of students corresponds to the boys.

Therefore, the number of boys is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of boys} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 100 = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of girls**: Similarly, the fraction of girls is \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\).
