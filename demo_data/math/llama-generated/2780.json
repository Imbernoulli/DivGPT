He decided now to buy 2 CDs by \"The Dark\", 1 CD by the creator \"AVN\", and 5 CDs that are mixes of songs from the 90s. The price of the \"AVN\" CD is $12 and it is half the price of one CD by \"The Dark\". The 5 CDs of 90s music cost is 40% of all the cost of all other CDs Alan is going to buy. How much will Alan have to pay for all the products?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
