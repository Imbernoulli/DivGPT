        "To determine the total number of petals Collin has after receiving some flowers from Ingrid, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of flowers Ingrid gives to Collin:**\n   Ingrid has 33 flowers and gives a third of them to Collin.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Flowers from Ingrid} = \\frac{33}{3} = 11\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the flowers from Ingrid to Collin's original flowers:**\n   Collin originally has 25 flowers. After receiving 11 flowers from Ingrid, the total number of flowers Collin has is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total flowers} = 25 + 11 = 36\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of petals:**\n   Each flower has 4 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals for 36 flowers is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total petals} = 36 \\times 4 = 144\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of petals Collin has is \\(\\boxed{144}\\).",
