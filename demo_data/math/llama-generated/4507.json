        "Let's denote Djibo's age five years ago as \\(D_5\\) and his sister's age five years ago as \\(S_5\\). According to the problem, Djibo was 12 years old five years ago because he is currently 17 years old. So, we have:\n\n\\[D_5 = 12\\]\n\nThe problem also states that five years ago, the sum of Djibo's age and his sister's age was 35. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[D_5 + S_5 = 35\\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\(D_5\\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[12 + S_5 = 35\\]\n\nTo find \\(S_5\\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[S_5 = 35 - 12\\]\n\\[S_5 = 23\\]\n\nSo, five years ago, Djibo's sister was 23 years old. To find out how old she is today, we add 5 years to her age five years ago:\n\n\\[S_{\\text{today}} = S_5 + 5\\]\n\\[S_{\\text{today}} = 23 + 5\\]\n\\[S_{\\text{today}} = 28\\]\n\nTherefore, Djibo's sister is \\(\\boxed{28}\\) years old today.",
