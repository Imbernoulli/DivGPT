        "To determine how many nuts were left after eating \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) of the nuts, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of nuts eaten.\n2. Subtract the number of nuts eaten from the total number of nuts.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many nuts were eaten. We know that \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) of the 30 nuts were eaten.
