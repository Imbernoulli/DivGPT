        "To determine how many spears Marcy can make out of 6 saplings and a log, we need to calculate the number of spears she can make from each type of wood separately and then sum the results.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of spears she can make from the saplings:\n- Marcy can make 3 spears out of one sapling.\n- Therefore, out of 6 saplings, she can make \\(6 \\times 3 = 18\\) spears.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of spears she can make from the log:\n- Marcy can make 9 spears out of one log.\n- Therefore, out of 1 log, she can make \\(1 \\times 9 = 9\\) spears.\n\nNow, we add the number of spears made from the saplings and the log:\n\\[18 + 9 = 27\\]\n\nSo, the total number of spears Marcy can make out of 6 saplings and a log is \\(\\boxed{27}\\).",
