        "To determine the total number of shoes Nancy has, we need to calculate the number of pairs of each type of footwear and then convert those into individual shoes.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of pairs of slippers Nancy has. Nancy has six pairs of boots and nine more pairs of slippers than boots. Therefore, the number of pairs of slippers is:\n\\[\n6 + 9 = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find the number of pairs of heels Nancy has. Nancy has a number of pairs of heels equal to three times the combined number of slippers and boots. The combined number of slippers and boots is:\n\\[\n6 + 15 = 21\n\\]\nSo, the number of pairs of heels is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 21 = 63\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of pairs of shoes Nancy has. This is the sum of the pairs of boots, slippers, and heels:\n\\[\n6 + 15 + 63 = 84\n\\]\n\nSince each pair of shoes consists of two individual shoes, the total number of individual shoes is:\n\\[\n84 \\times 2 = 168\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of shoes Nancy has is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{168}\n\\]",

Calculate the number of pairs of heels Nancy has.\n3. Find the total number of pairs of shoes.\n4. Convert the total number of pairs of shoes into the total number of individual shoes.\n\nFirst, we know that Nancy has six pairs of boots. Since she has nine more pairs of slippers than pairs of boots, we can calculate the number of pairs of slippers as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of pairs of slippers} = 6 + 9 = 15 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of pairs of heels. The number of pairs of heels is three times the combined number of pairs of slippers and boots. First, we calculate the combined number of pairs of slippers and boots:\n\\[ \\text{Combined number of pairs of slippers and boots} = 6 + 15 = 21 \\]\nThen, we calculate the number of pairs of heels:\n\\[ \\text{Number of pairs of heels} = 3 \\times 21 = 63 \\]\n\nNow, we find the total number of pairs of shoes by adding the number of pairs of boots, slippers, and heels:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of pairs of shoes} = 6 + 15 + 63 = 84 \\]\n\nSince each pair of shoes consists of two individual shoes, we convert the total number of pairs of shoes into the total number of individual shoes:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of individual shoes} = 84 \\times 2 = 168 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of shoes Nancy has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{168} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of shoes Nancy has, we need to calculate the number of pairs of each type of footwear and then convert those pairs into individual shoes.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many pairs of slippers Nancy has. She has nine more pairs of slippers than pairs of boots. Since she has six pairs of boots, we can calculate the number of pairs of slippers as follows:\n\\[\n6 + 9 = 15\n\\]\nSo, Nancy has 15 pairs of slippers.\n\nNext, let's find out how many pairs of heels Nancy has. She has a number of pairs of heels equal to three times the combined number of slippers and boots. First, we need to find the combined number of slippers and boots:\n\\[\n6 + 15 = 21\n\\]\nThen, we multiply this sum by three to find the number of pairs of heels:\n\\[\n3 \\times 21 = 63\n\\]\nSo, Nancy has 63 pairs of heels.\n\nNow, we add up the number of pairs of boots, slippers, and heels to find the total number of pairs of shoes:\n\\[\n6 + 15 + 63 = 84\n\\]\nSince each pair of shoes consists of two individual shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by two to find the total number of individual shoes:\n\\[\n84 \\times 2 = 168\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of individual shoes Nancy has is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{168}\n\\]"
