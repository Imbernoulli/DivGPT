Therefore, the total number of cards given away is:\n\\[\n6 + 2 = 8\n\\]\nNext, we subtract the total number of cards given away from the original number of cards to find out how many cards Joseph has left:\n\\[\n16 - 8 = 8\n\\]\nNow, we need to convert the remaining number of cards into a percentage of the original number of cards. The original number of cards is 16, and Joseph has 8 cards left. The percentage is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{8}{16} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\%\n\\]\nSo, the percentage of the cards left to Joseph is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]",

Convert the number of remaining cards to a percentage of the original number of cards.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of cards Joseph gave to his brother initially.\nJoseph gave \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) of his 16 cards to his brother.\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8} \\times 16 = 6\n\\]\nSo, Joseph gave 6 cards to his brother initially.\n\nStep 2: Add the 2 cards he gave to his physics.\nJoseph also gave 2 cards to his physics. Therefore, the total number of cards he gave away is:\n\\[\n6 + 2 = 8\n\\]\n\nStep 3: Find out how many cards he has left.\nJoseph started with 16 cards and gave away 8 cards. So, the number of cards he has left is:\n\\[\n16 - 8 = 8\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Convert the number of remaining cards to a percentage of the original number of cards.\nTo find the percentage of the cards left, we use the formula:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\text{number of cards left}}{\\text{original number of cards}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{8}{16} \\right) \\times 100 = 50\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the cards left to Joseph is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
        "To determine what percentage of his baseball cards Joseph has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cards Joseph gave to his brother.\n2. Subtract the number of cards given to his brother from the total number of cards Joseph originally had.\n3. Determine the percentage of the original number of cards that Joseph has left.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of cards Joseph gave to his brother. Joseph gave \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) of his cards to his brother. Since Joseph originally had 16 cards, we multiply 16 by \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8} \\times 16 = \\frac{3 \\times 16}{8} = \\frac{48}{8} = 6\n\\]\nSo, Joseph gave 6 cards to his brother. He also gave 2 cards to his brother. Therefore, the total number of cards he gave to his brother is:\n\\[\n6 + 2 = 8\n\\]\nNext, we subtract the total number of cards given to his brother from the original number of cards Joseph had:\n\\[\n16 - 8 = 8\n\\]\nSo, Joseph has 8 cards left. To find out what percentage of the original number of cards Joseph has left, we use the formula:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\text{number of cards left}}{\\text{original number of cards}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{8}{16} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.5 \\times 100 = 50\n\\]\nTherefore, the percentage of the cards left to Joseph is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]",
