        "To determine the total number of stamps in Tom's collection after receiving gifts from Mike and Harry, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of stamps Mike gave to Tom.\n2. Calculate the number of stamps Harry gave to Tom.\n3. Add the stamps given by Mike and Harry to Tom's original collection.\n\nFirst, we know that Mike gave Tom 17 stamps. Next, we need to find out how many stamps Harry gave. According to the problem, Harry's gift is 10 more stamps than twice Mike's gift. So, we calculate Harry's gift as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Harry's gift} = 2 \\times \\text{Mike's gift} + 10 = 2 \\times 17 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the stamps given by Mike and Harry to Tom's original collection:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total stamps} = \\text{Original collection} + \\text{Mike's gift} + \\text{Harry's gift} = 3000 + 17 + 44 = 3061\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of stamps in Tom's collection now is \\boxed{3061}.",

Add the stamps from Mike and Harry to Tom's original collection.\n\nFirst, we know that Mike gave Tom 17 stamps. \n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of stamps Harry gave to Tom. According to the problem, Harry's gift is 10 more stamps than twice Mike's gift.

Tom's original collection had 3,000 stamps. Adding the stamps from Mike and Harry, we get:\n\\[ 3000 + 17 + 44 = 3061 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of stamps Tom's collection now has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3061} \\]",

Next, we need to calculate how many stamps Harry gave Tom. According to the problem, Harry's gift is 10 more stamps than twice Mike's gift. We can express this mathematically as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Harry's gift} = 2 \\times \\text{Mike's gift} + 10\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the value of Mike's gift into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Harry's gift} = 2 \\times 17 + 10\n\\]\n\nCalculate the multiplication first:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 17 = 34\n\\]\n\nThen add 10 to the result:\n\n\\[\n34 + 10 = 44\n\\]\n\nSo, Harry gave Tom 44 stamps.
