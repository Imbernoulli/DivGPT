Add the lengths of the original songs and the additional songs to get the total length of the album.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total length of the original 25 songs. Since each song is 3 minutes long, we multiply the number of songs by the length of each song:\n\\[\n25 \\text{ songs} \\times 3 \\text{ minutes/song} = 75 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total length of the 10 additional songs. Since each of these songs is also 3 minutes long, we multiply the number of additional songs by the length of each song:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ songs} \\times 3 \\text{ minutes/song} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the lengths of the original songs and the additional songs to get the total length of the album:\n\\[\n75 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 105 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take Hansel to finish all the songs in the album is \\boxed{105}.",
        "To determine the total number of minutes it will take Hansel to finish all the songs in the album after adding more songs, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.
