        "To determine how many more fish Jacob needs to catch to beat Alex by just 1 fish, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial number of fish Alex caught.\n2. Determine the number of fish Alex has after losing 23 fish.\n3. Find out how many more fish Jacob needs to catch to have one more fish than Alex.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial number of fish Alex caught. Alex caught 7 times as many fish as Jacob. Since Jacob had 8 fish, we can calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Initial number of fish Alex caught} = 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many fish Alex has after losing 23 fish. Since Alex initially had 56 fish, after losing 23 fish, he has:\n\\[ \\text{Number of fish Alex has after losing 23 fish} = 56 - 23 = 33 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more fish Jacob needs to catch to have one more fish than Alex. currently, Jacob has 8 fish, and Alex has 33 fish. To beat Alex by just 1 fish, Jacob needs to have:\n\\[ 33 + 1 = 34 \\text{ fish} \\]\nSince Jacob currently has 8 fish, the number of additional fish he needs to catch is:\n\\[ 34 - 8 = 26 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jacob needs to catch \\(\\boxed{26}\\) more fish to beat Alex by just 1 fish.",

Since Alex caught 7 times as many fish as Jacob, we multiply Jacob's number of fish by 7:\n\\[ 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\]\nSo, Alex initially had 56 fish.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many fish Alex has after losing some.**\n\nAlex lost 23 fish back to the lake.

Since Alex now has 33 fish, Jacob needs:\n\\[ 33 + 1 = 34 \\]\nSo, Jacob needs 34 fish to beat Alex by 1 fish.\n\nSince Jacob already has 8 fish, we need to find out how many more fish he needs to catch:\n\\[ 34 - 8 = 26 \\]\nSo, Jacob needs to catch \\(\\boxed{26}\\) more fish to beat Alex by just 1 fish.",
