Therefore, the number of thank you cards she received is:\n   \\[\n   0.30x\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of thank you cards containing gift cards:**\n   According to the problem, 1/3 of the thank you cards contained a gift card. Thus, the number of thank you cards with gift cards is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 0.30x = 0.10x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total value of the gift cards:**\n   Each gift card is worth $10, and the total value of the gift cards Ms. Jones received is $50. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 0.10x = 50\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   1x = 50\n   \\]\n   Thus, we find:\n   \\[\n   x = 50\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students in Ms. Jones's class is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of students in Ms. Jones's class, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of students who sent thank you cards:**\n   Ms. Jones received thank you cards from 30% of her class. Let \\( N \\) be the total number of students in the class. Then, the number of students who sent thank you cards is:\n   \\[\n   0.30N\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of thank you cards that contained a gift card:**\n   One-third of the thank you cards contained a gift card. Therefore, the number of thank you cards with a gift card is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 0.30N = 0.10N\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total value of the gift cards:**\n   Each gift card is worth $10, and the total value of all the gift cards is $50. Therefore, the number of gift cards is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50}{10} = 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set up the equation and solve for \\( N \\):**\n   Since the number of gift cards is equal to \\( 0.10N \\), we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.10N = 5\n   \\]\n   To find \\( N \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.10:\n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{5}{0.10} = 50\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students in Ms. Jones's class is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",

Therefore, the number of thank you cards she received is:\n   \\[\n   0.3N\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of thank you cards containing gift cards:**\n   One-third of the thank you cards contained a gift card. Thus, the number of thank you cards with gift cards is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 0.3N = 0.1N\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total value of the gift cards:**\n   Each gift card is worth $10, and the total value of all gift cards is $50. Therefore, the number of gift cards can also be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50}{10} = 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set up the equation and solve for \\( N \\):**\n   Since the number of thank you cards with gift cards is equal to 5, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   0.1N = 5\n   \\]\n   To find \\( N \\), divide both sides of the equation by 0.1:\n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{5}{0.1} = 50\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of students in Ms. Jones's class is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
