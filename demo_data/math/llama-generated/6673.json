        "First, we need to determine how much time Henri spends watching movies. He watches one movie that is 3.5 hours and one movie that is 1.5 hours. We add these times together:\n\n\\[3.5 + 1.5 = 5 \\text{ hours}\\]\n\nHenri has a total of 8 hours available, so we subtract the time spent watching movies from the total time to find out how much time he has left for reading:\n\n\\[8 - 5 = 3 \\text{ hours}\\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the remaining time into minutes, since the reading speed is given in words per minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply the remaining hours by 60:\n\n\\[3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ minutes}\\]\n\nHenri can read 10 words per minute, so we multiply the number of minutes he has left by his reading speed to find out how many words he reads:\n\n\\[180 \\times 10 = 1800 \\text{ words}\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of words Henri reads before his free time is up is \\(\\boxed{1800}\\).",

Calculate the number of words Henri reads based on his reading speed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time Henri spends watching movies. He watches one movie that is 3.5 hours and one movie that is 1.5 hours:\n\\[ 3.5 + 1.5 = 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total movie-watching time from his total free time to find out how much time he has left for reading. Henri has 8 hours in total:\n\\[ 8 - 5 = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the remaining time into minutes:\n\\[ 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nHenri can read 10 words a minute, so we calculate the total number of words he reads:\n\\[ 180 \\times 10 = 1800 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of words Henri reads before his free time is up is \\(\\boxed{1800}\\).",
        "To determine how many words Henri reads, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time Henri spends watching movies.\n2. Subtract the total movie-watching time from his total free time to find out how much time he has left for reading.\n3. Convert the remaining time from hours to minutes.\n4. Calculate the number of words Henri reads in the remaining time.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total time Henri spends watching movies.**\n\nHenri watches two movies:\n- The first movie is 3.5 hours.\n- The second movie is 1.5 hours.\n\nAdding these times together:\n\\[ 3.5 + 1.5 = 5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Subtract the total movie-watching time from his total free time.**\n\nHenri has 8 hours of free time. Subtracting the 5 hours he spends watching movies:\n\\[ 8 - 5 = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert the remaining time from hours to minutes.**\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour. Multiplying the remaining hours by 60:\n\\[ 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of words Henri reads in the remaining time.**\n\nHenri reads 10 words per minute. Multiplying the number of minutes by the reading rate:\n\\[ 180 \\times 10 = 1800 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of words Henri reads before his free time is up is \\(\\boxed{1800}\\).",
