        "To find the total number of people at the concert, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of people there for the second band.\n2. Use the information about the age distribution to find the total number of people there for the second band.\n3. Use the information about the gender distribution to verify the number of people there for the second band.\n4. Use the испол information to find the total number of people at the concert.\n\nLet's start with the information given:\n\n- 2/3 of the audience was there for the second band.\n- 50% of the audience there for the second band is under the age of 30.\n- Of the people under the age of 30 there for the second band, 60% are women and there are 20 men.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of people under the age of 30 there for the second band. Since 60% of the people under the age of 30 are women, 40% must be men. We know there are 20 men, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 0.4 \\times \\text{(number of people under the age of 30)} = 20 \\]\n\nSolving for the number of people under the age of 30:\n\n\\[ \\text{(number of people under the age of 30)} = \\frac{20}{0.4} = 50 \\]\n\nSo, there are 50 people under the age of 30 there for the second band. Since 50% of the audience there for the second band is under the age of 30, the total number of people there for the second band is:\n\n\\[ \\text{(total number of people there for the second band)} = \\frac{50}{0.5} = 100 \\]\n\nSince 2/3 of the audience was there for the second band, the total number of people at the concert is:\n\n\\[ \\text{(total number of people at the concert)} = \\frac{100}{\\frac{2}{3}} = 100 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 150 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people at the concert is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]",

Since the total number of people under the age of 30 is the sum of the number of women and the number of men under the age of 30, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{1}{5}x + 20\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first eliminate the fractions by finding a common denominator. The common denominator of 3 and 5 is 15. Multiplying every term by 15, we get:\n\\[\n15 \\times \\frac{1}{3}x = 15 \\times \\frac{1}{5}x + 15 \\times 20\n\\]\n\\[\n5x = 3x + 300\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting \\( 3x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n5x - 3x = 300\n\\]\n\\[\n2x = 300\n\\]\n\nFinally, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx = 150\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people at the concert is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{150}\n\\]",
