Therefore, the total time spent in spinning classes each week is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ classes/week} \\times 1.5 \\text{ hours/class} = 4.5 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the total time from hours to minutes because the calories burned per minute are given. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total hours by 60:\n\\[ 4.5 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 270 \\text{ minutes/week} \\]\n\nNow, we know that James burns 7 calories per minute. Therefore, the total calories burned per week is:\n\\[ 270 \\text{ minutes/week} \\times 7 \\text{ calories/minute} = 1890 \\text{ calories/week} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of calories James burns per week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1890} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of calories James burns per week, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the total time spent in spinning classes per week:**\n   - James takes a spinning class 3 times a week.\n   - Each class lasts 1.5 hours.\n   - Convert hours to minutes: \\(1.5 \\text{ hours} = 1.5 \\times 60 = 90 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n   - Total time spent per week: \\(3 \\text{ classes} \\times 90 \\text{ minutes/class} = 270 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total calories burned per week:**\n   - James burns 7 calories per minute.\n   - Total calories burned per week: \\(270 \\text{ minutes} \\times 7 \\text{ calories/minute} = 1890 \\text{ calories}\\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of calories James burns per week is \\(\\boxed{1890}\\).",

        "To determine how many calories James burns per week from his spinning classes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of minutes James spends in a single class.\n2. Determine the total number of calories burned in a single class.\n3. Calculate the total number of calories burned per week.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes James spends in a single class.**\n\nJames works out for 1.5 hours each class. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert hours to minutes:\n\\[ 1.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 90 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of calories burned in a single class.**\n\nJames burns 7 calories per minute. Therefore, the total number of calories burned in one class is:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ minutes} \\times 7 \\text{ calories/minute} = 630 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of calories burned per week.**\n\nJames takes a spinning class 3 times a week. Therefore, the total number of calories burned per week is:\n\\[ 630 \\text{ calories/class} \\times 3 \\text{ classes/week} = 1890 \\text{ calories/week} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of calories James burns per week is \\(\\boxed{1890}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of calories James burns per week from his spinning classes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of minutes James spends in a single spinning class.\n2. Determine the total number of calories burned in a single spinning class.\n3. Calculate the total number of calories burned in a week.\n\nFirst, we convert the duration of a single spinning class from hours to minutes. Since each class is 1.5 hours and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:\n\\[ 1.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 90 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of calories burned in a single spinning class. Since James burns 7 calories per minute, we have:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ minutes} \\times 7 \\text{ calories/minute} = 630 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of calories burned in a week. Since James takes a spinning class 3 times a week, we have:\n\\[ 630 \\text{ calories/class} \\times 3 \\text{ classes/week} = 1890 \\text{ calories/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of calories James burns per week is \\(\\boxed{1890}\\).",
        "To determine how many calories James burns per week from his spinning classes, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the total time James spends in spinning classes each week:**\n   - James takes a spinning class 3 times a week.\n   - Each class lasts 1.5 hours.\n   - First, convert the hours into minutes:\n     \\[\n     1.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 90 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Now, calculate the total time for 3 classes:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ classes} \\times 90 \\text{ minutes/class} = 270 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of calories burned:**\n   - James burns 7 calories per minute.\n   - Multiply the total time by the calories burned per minute:\n     \\[\n     270 \\text{ minutes} \\times 7 \\text{ calories/minute} = 1890 \\text{ calories}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of calories James burns per week is \\(\\boxed{1890}\\).",
