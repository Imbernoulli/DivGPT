        "To determine the total cost of both a pen and a pencil, we start by identifying the cost of each item.\n\nFirst, we know the cost of a pencil is $2. Let's denote the cost of a pencil as \\( P \\). So, we have:\n\\[ P = 2 \\]\n\nNext, we know that a pen costs $9 more than a pencil. Let's denote the cost of a pen as \\(\n        \n \\). Therefore, we can express the cost of a pen as:\n\\[ C = P + 9 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( P \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ C = 2 + 9 = 11 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total cost of both the pen and the pencil. We do this by adding the cost of the pen and the cost of the pencil:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = P + C = 2 + 11 = 13 \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of both items is:\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]",
