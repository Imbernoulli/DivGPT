        "To determine Marian's new credit card balance, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Balance**: Marian starts with a balance of $126.00.\n2. **Groceries**: She adds $60.00 worth of groceries to her card.\n3. **Gas**: She adds half the amount of groceries in gas. Since groceries are $60.00, gas is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60.00}{2} = 30.00\n   \\]\n4. **Bath Towels**: She returns bath towels for $45.00, which reduces her balance.\n\nNow, let's calculate the new balance step by step:\n\n1. **Add Groceries**:\n   \\[\n   126.00 + 60.00 = 186.00\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add Gas**:\n   \\[\n   186.00 + 30.00 = 216.00\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtractphant礼包**:\n   \\[\n   216.00 - 45.00 = 171.00\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Marian's new credit card balance is \\(\\boxed{171.00}\\).",
