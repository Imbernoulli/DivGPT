        "To determine how many bottles the first house gets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of bottles that contain a mixture of cider and beer.\n2. Determine the total number of each type of bottle before the delivery to the first house.\n3. Calculate the number of each type of bottle given to the first house.\n4. Sum the number of each type of bottle given to the first house to find the total.\n\nFirst, we know the total number of bottles is 180. Out of these, 40 contain only cider and 80 contain only beer. The rest are a mixture of the two drinks. Therefore, the number of bottles that contain a mixture of cider and beer is:\n\\[ 180 - 40 - 80 = 60. \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many bottles of each type the first house gets. Since the delivery man gives half the number of each type of bottle to the first house, we calculate:\n- Half of the bottles containing only cider: \\( \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\),\n- Half of the bottles containing only beer: \\( \\frac{80}{2} = 40 \\),\n- Half of the bottles containing a mixture of cider and beer: \\( \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\).\n\nNow, we sum the number of each type of bottle given to the first house:\n\\[ 20 + 40 + 30 = 90. \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of bottles the first house gets is:\n\\[ \\boxed{90}. \\]",
