Therefore, the number of 500 mg amoxicillin capsules sold each week is:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out the total number of capsules sold each week by adding the number of 100 mg amoxicillin capsules and the number of 500 mg amoxicillin capsules:\n\\[\n16 + 30 = 46\n\\]\n\nSince we need to find out how many capsules Heisenberg sells every 2 weeks, we multiply the total number of capsules sold each week by 2:\n\\[\n46 \\times 2 = 92\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of capsules of amoxicillin Heisenberg sells every 2 weeks is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{92}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many capsules of amoxicillin Heisenberg sells every 2 weeks, we need to first find out how many capsules of each type he sells in one week.\n\nLet's denote the number of 100 mg amoxicillin capsules Heisenberg sells in one week as \\( x \\) and the number of 500 mg amoxicillin capsules he sells in one week as \\( y \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following:\n1. He earns $80 from 100 mg amoxicillin each week.\n2. He earns $60 from 500 mg amoxicillin each week.\n3. Each capsule of 100 mg amoxicillin costs $5.\n4. Each capsule of 500 mg amoxicillin costs $2.\n\nWe can set up the following equations based on the information given:\n\\[ 5x = 80 \\]\n\\[ 2y = 60 \\]\n\nSolving the first equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{80}{5} = 16 \\]\n\nSolving the second equation for \\( y \\):\n\\[ y = \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\]\n\nSo, Heisenberg sells 16 capsules of 100 mg amoxicillin and 30 capsules of 500 mg amoxicillin each week.
