        "To determine how many miles James needs to add per week, we first need to calculate his target running distance. James wants to run 20% more than his previous weekly total of 100 miles.

        "To determine how many miles James needs to add per week, we start by calculating his goal for the week. Since he wants to run 20% more than his previous weekly total of 100 miles, his goal is:\n\n\\[ 100 + 0.2 \\times 100 = 100 + 20 = 120 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many weeks it will take him to reach his goal. Since there are 7 days in a week, 280 days is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{280}{7} = 40 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of miles James adds per week. Since he starts with 0 miles in the first week and increases his miles each week by \\( x \\), after 40 weeks he will have added \\( 40x \\) miles to his total. Therefore, the total number of miles he will have run after 40 weeks is:\n\n\\[ 40x = 120 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{120}{40} = 3 \\]\n\nSo, James needs to add \\(\\boxed{3}\\) miles per week.",

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide 280 by 7:\n\n\\[ 280 \\text{ days} \\div 7 \\text{ days/week} = 40 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nJames starts with 0 miles in the first week and increases his running distance each week by the same amount. Let's call this increase per week \\( x \\). After 40 weeks, his running distance will be \\( 40x \\) miles. We know that after 40 weeks, he wants to be running 120 miles per week, so we set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 40x = 120 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 40:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{120}{40} = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, James needs to add \\(\\boxed{3}\\) miles per week to reach his goal.",
        "To determine how many miles James needs to add per week to his running distance, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the target running distance:**\n   James wants to run 20% more than his previous weekly distance of 100 miles.\n   \\[\n   20\\% \\text{ of } 100 \\text{ miles} = 0.20 \\times 100 = 20 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, his target running distance is:\n   \\[\n   100 \\text{ miles} + 20 \\text{ miles} = 120 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total increase in miles needed:**\n   The total increase from 0 miles (assuming he starts with no running) to 120 miles per week is:\n   \\[\n   120 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the time period from days to weeks:**\n   James has 280 days to achieve his goal. Converting days to weeks:\n   \\[\n   280 \\text{ days} \\div 7 \\text{ days per week} = 40 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the weekly increase in miles:**\n   To find out how many miles he needs to add each week, divide the total increase by the number of weeks:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120 \\text{ miles}}{40 \\text{ weeks}} = 3 \\text{ miles per week}\n   \\]\n\nThus, James needs to add \\boxed{3} miles per week to his running distance."
