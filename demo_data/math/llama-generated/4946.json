        "To determine the total number of toys that Jerry, Gabriel, and Jaxon have, we start by identifying the number of toys each boy has based on the information given.\n\nFirst, we know that Jaxon has 15 toys:\n\\[\nJ = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we are told that Gabriel has twice as many toys as Jaxon. Therefore, the number of toys Gabriel has is:\n\\[\nG = 2J = 2 \\times 15 = 30\n\\]\n\nThen, we are told that Jerry has 8 more toys than Gabriel.
