        "To determine how many more words Matt would write in 5 minutes with his right hand than with his left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of words Matt writes in 5 minutes with his right hand.\n2. Calculate the number of words Matt writes in 5 minutes with his left hand.\n3. Subtract the number of words written with his left hand from the number of words written with his right hand.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of words Matt writes in 5 minutes with his right hand. Since he writes 10 words per minute with his right hand, in 5 minutes he writes:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ words/minute} \\times 5 \\text{ minutes} = 50 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of words Matt writes in 5 minutes with his left hand. Since he writes 7 words per minute with his left hand, in 5 minutes he writes:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ words/minute} \\times 5 \\text{ minutes} = 35 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of words written with his left hand from the number of words written with his right hand:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ words} - 35 \\text{ words} = 15 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nTherefore, Matt would write \\(\\boxed{15}\\) more words in 5 minutes with his right hand than with his left.",
