They sold all the mushrooms they picked on the first day for a total of $58. The day after, they picked 12 mushrooms. On the last day, they picked double the mushrooms they had picked the previous day. If the price per mushroom was $2, what is the total number of mushrooms they picked?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total number of mushrooms Keziah and her mom picked during their three-day trip, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of mushrooms they picked on the first day as \\( x \\). According to the problem, they sold all the mushrooms they picked on the first day for a total of $58. Since the price per mushroom is $2, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 2x = 58 \\]\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[ x = \\frac{58}{2} = 29 \\]\nSo, they picked 29 mushrooms on the first day.\n\nNext, we know that on the second day, they picked 12 mushrooms. On the third day, they picked double the number of mushrooms they picked on the second day. Therefore, the number of mushrooms they picked on the third day is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total number of mushrooms they picked over the three days by adding the mushrooms picked each day:\n\\[ 29 + 12 + 24 = 65 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of mushrooms they picked is:\n\\[ \\boxed{65} \\]",
