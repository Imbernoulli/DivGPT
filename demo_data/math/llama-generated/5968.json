        "To determine the number of sharks in Cape May, we start by identifying the number of sharks in Daytona Beach and using the given relationship between the number of sharks in Cape May and Daytona Beach.\n\n1. We know that Daytona Beach has 12 sharks.\n2. According to the problem, Cape May has 8 more than twice as many sharks as Daytona Beach. We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of sharks in Cape May} = 2 \\times (\\text{Number of sharks in Daytona Beach}) + 8\n   \\]\n3. Substituting the number of sharks in Daytona Beach into the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of sharks in Cape May} = 2 \\times 12 + 8\n   \\]\n4. First, we perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 12 = 24\n   \\]\n5. Then, we add 8 to the result:\n   \\[\n   24 + 8 = 32\n   \\]\nTherefore, the number of sharks in Cape May is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
