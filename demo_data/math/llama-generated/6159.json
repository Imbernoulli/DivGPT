        "To determine the cost per trip to the park, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the season passes:**\n   - Patrick buys one season pass for each son.\n   - Each season pass costs $100.00.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for both season passes is:\n     \\[\n     100 + 100 = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of trips to the park:**\n   - The oldest son went to the park 35 times.\n   - The youngest son went to the park 15 times.\n   - Therefore, the total number of trips to the park is:\n     \\[\n     35 + 15 = 50 \\text{ trips}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the cost per trip:**\n   - To find the cost per trip, we divide the total cost of the season passes by the total number of trips:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{200 \\text{ dollars}}{50 \\text{ trips}} = 4 \\text{ dollars per trip}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the cost per trip to the park is \\(\\boxed{4}\\) dollars.",
