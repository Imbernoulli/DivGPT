Since 50% of the seaweed is only good for starting fires, we have:\n\\[ 0.50 \\times 400 = 200 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount of seaweed used for starting fires from the total amount of seaweed to find out how much seaweed is left:\n\\[ 400 - 200 = 200 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate how much of the remaining seaweed can be eaten by humans. Since 25% of the remaining seaweed can be eaten by humans, we have:\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 200 = 50 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the amount of seaweed eaten by humans from the remaining seaweed to find out how much seaweed is fed to livestock:\n\\[ 200 - 50 = 150 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pounds of seaweed fed to livestock is:\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]",
