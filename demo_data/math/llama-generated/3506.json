        "To determine how much money Kurt saves in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the daily savings from the new refrigerator.\n2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in the month.\n\nFirst, let's find the daily savings. The cost of electricity for the old refrigerator is $0.85 per day, and the cost of electricity for the new refrigerator is $0.45 per day. The daily savings is the difference between these two amounts:\n\\[\n0.85 - 0.45 = 0.40\n\\]\nSo, Kurt saves $0.40 per day with his new refrigerator.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much he saves in a 30-day month. We do this by multiplying the daily savings by 30:\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 30 = 12\n\\]\nTherefore, Kurt saves \\(\\boxed{12}\\) dollars in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator.",
