        "To determine how many meters of rope Orlan has left, we need to follow the steps of his attends to the rope:\n\n1. **Calculate the length of rope given to Allan:**\n   Orlan initially has a 20-meter rope. He gives one-fourth of it to Allan.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rope given to Allan} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 = 5 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the remaining length of rope after giving some to Allan:**\n   After giving 5 meters to Allan, the remaining length of the rope is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining rope} = 20 - 5 = 15 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the length of rope given to Jack:**\n   Orlan then gives two-thirds of the remaining rope to Jack.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rope given to Jack} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 15 = 10 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the remaining length of rope after giving some to Jack:**\n   After giving 10 meters to Jack, the remaining length of the rope is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining rope} = 15 - 10 = 5 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of meters of rope left to Orlan is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
