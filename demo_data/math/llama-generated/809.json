Calculate the amount of water used to wash the plates and clothes.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water used to clean the two cars.**\n\nJan uses 7 gallons of water for each car. Since she has two cars, the total water used for the cars is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ gallons/car} \\times 2 \\text{ cars} = 14 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the amount of water used to water the plants.**\n\nJan uses 11 fewer gallons than the two cars to water the plants. Since she used 14 gallons to clean the cars, the amount of water used to water the plants is:\n\\[ 14 \\text{ gallons} - 11 \\text{ gallons} = 3 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the water used for the cars and plants from the initial amount of water.**\n\nThe initial amount of water is 65 gallons. After using 14 gallons for the cars and 3 gallons for the plants, the remaining amount of water is:\n\\[ 65 \\text{ gallons} - 14 \\text{ gallons} - 3 \\text{ gallons} = 48 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the amount of water used to wash the plates and clothes.**\n\nJan uses half of the remaining water to wash the plates and clothes. Since the remaining amount of water is 48 gallons, the amount of water used is:\n\\[ \\frac{48 \\text{ gallons}}{2} = 24 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of gallons of water Jan uses to wash her plates and clothes is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",

        "To determine how many gallons of water Jan uses to wash her plates and clothes, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of water used to clean the two cars:**\n   Jan uses 7 gallons of water for each car.\n   \\[\n   7 \\text{ gallons/car} \\times 2 \\text{ cars} = 14 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the amount of water used to water the plants:**\n   Jan uses 11 fewer gallons than the two cars.\n   \\[\n   14 \\text{ gallons} - 11 \\text{ gallons} = 3 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of water used for cleaning the cars and watering the plants:**\n   \\[\n   14 \\text{ gallons} + 3 \\text{ gallons} = 17 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the remaining amount of water after cleaning the cars and watering the plants:**\n   Jan initially collected 65 gallons.\n   \\[\n   65 \\text{ gallons} - 17 \\text{ gallons} = 48 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the amount of water used to wash the plates and clothes:**\n   Jan uses half of the remaining water.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{48 \\text{ gallons}}{2} = 24 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of gallons of water Jan uses to wash her plates and clothes is \\(\\boxed{24}\\)."
