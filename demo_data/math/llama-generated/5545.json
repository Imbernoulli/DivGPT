        "To determine how many bags of rice the trader sold, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of bags of rice.\n2. Subtract the number of bags sold.\n3.

After selling \\( x \\) bags, the trader has \\( 55 - x \\) bags.\n4. The trader then restocks 132 bags, so the total number of bags becomes \\( (55 - x) + 132 \\).\n5. We know that after these transactions, the trader has 164 bags of rice. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   (55 - x) + 132 = 164\n   \\]\n6. Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   187 - x = 164\n   \\]\n7.
