        "To determine how many apples each guest eats on average, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of servings Jessica will make.\n2. Determine the total number of apples required.\n3. Divide the total number of apples by the number of guests to find the average number of apples each guest eats.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of servings Jessica will make. She plans to make 3 pies, and each pie contains 8 servings. So, the total number of servings is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ pies} \\times 8 \\text{ servings per pie} = 24 \\text{ servings} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many apples are required for these 24 servings. Since each serving requires 1.5 apples, the total number of apples needed is:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ servings} \\times 1.5 \\text{ apples per serving} = 36 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nNow, we divide the total number of apples by the number of guests to find the average number of apples each guest eats. Jessica has 12 guests, so:\n\\[ \\frac{36 \\text{ apples}}{12 \\text{ guests}} = 3 \\text{ apples per guest} \\]\n\nTherefore, on average, each guest eats \\(\\boxed{3}\\) apples.",
