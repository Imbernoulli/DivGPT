        "To determine the total cost of the ingredients Martha needs to buy, we will calculate the cost of the cheese and the cost of the meat separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the cheese:\n- Martha needs 1.5 kg of cheese.\n- The cost of cheese is $6 per kilogram.\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of cheese} = 1.5 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 6 \\, \\text{\\$/kg} = 9 \\, \\text{\\$}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the meat:\n- Martha needs 500 grams of meat.\n- The cost of meat is $8 per kilogram.\n- Since 1 kilogram equals 1000 grams, we convert 500 grams to kilograms:\n\\[\n500 \\, \\text{grams} = \\frac{500}{1000} \\, \\text{kg} = 0.5 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n- Now, we calculate the cost of 0.5 kg of meat:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of meat} = 0.5 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 8 \\, \\text{\\$/kg} = 4 \\, \\text{\\$}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the costs of the cheese and the meat to find the total cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of cheese} + \\text{Cost of meat} = 9 \\, \\text{\\$} + 4 \\, \\text{\\$} = 13 \\, \\text{\\$}\n\\]\n\nThus, Martha needs to pay \\boxed{13} dollars for the ingredients.",
