Since John bought only one batch of loot boxes, the average loss is the total loss.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\nJohn spends $40 on loot boxes, and each loot box costs $5. Therefore, the number of loot boxes he bought is:\n\\[\n\\frac{40}{5} = 8\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the total value of the items inside the loot boxes. Since the average value of items inside each loot box is $3.5, the total value of the items in 8 loot boxes is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 3.5 = 28\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total amount spent on the loot boxes, which is given as $40.\n\nThe total loss is the total amount spent minus the total value of the items:\n\\[\n40 - 28 = 12\n\\]\n\nSince John bought only one batch of loot boxes, the average loss is the total loss, which is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
        "To determine the average amount John lost, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of loot boxes John buys:**\n   John spends $40 on loot boxes, and each loot box costs $5.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of loot boxes} = \\frac{\\text{Total Monday Guth Dil오는}{\\text{Cost per loot box}} = \\frac{40}{5} = 8\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total value of the items John gets:**\n   The average value of items inside each loot box is $3.5.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total value of items} = \\text{Number of loot boxes} \\times \\text{Average value per loot box} = 8 \\times 3.5 = 28\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount John spends:**\n   John spends $40.\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount John loses:**\n   The total loss is the difference between the total amount spent and the total value of the items.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total loss} = \\text{Total amount spent} - \\text{Total value of items} = 40 - 28 = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average amount John lost is \\boxed{12}.",
