        "To determine which neighborhood will provide Jenny with more revenue, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of cookies she can sell in each neighborhood and then find out how much money she will make from those sales.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of boxes of cookies sold in Neighborhood A:\n- There are 10 homes in Neighborhood A.\n- Each home buys 2 boxes of cookies.\n\\[\n10 \\text{ homes} \\times 2 \\text{ boxes per home} = 20 \\text{ boxes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of boxes of cookies sold in Neighborhood B:\n- There are 5 homes in Neighborhood B.\n- Each home buys 5 boxes of cookies.\n\\[\n5 \\text{ homes} \\times 5 \\text{ boxes per home} = 25 \\text{ boxes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much money Jenny will make from selling these boxes of cookies. Each box of cookies costs $2.\n\nFor Neighborhood A:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ boxes} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per box} = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFor Neighborhood B:\n\\[\n25 \\text{ boxes} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per box} = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nComparing the two amounts, Jenny will make more money in Neighborhood B. Therefore, the better choice is Neighborhood B, and she will make \\(\\boxed{50}\\) dollars."
