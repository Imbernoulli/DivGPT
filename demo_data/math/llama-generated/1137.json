Samuel ate half of the apples he bought:\n\\[ \\frac{28}{2} = 14 \\]\nSo, Samuel ate 14 apples.\n\nThen, we need to find out how many apples Samuel used to make apple pie. Samuel used \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) of the apples he bought:\n\\[ \\frac{28}{7} = 4 \\]\nSo, Samuel used 4 apples to make apple pie.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of apples eaten and the number of apples used from the total number of apples Samuel bought:\n\\[ 28 - 14 - 4 = 10 \\]\nSo, Samuel has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) apples left.",
