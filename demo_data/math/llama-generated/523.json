        "To determine how many stickers Xia had at the beginning, we need to consider both the stickers she shared and the stickers she had left after sharing.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of stickers Xia had left after sharing. Since she had five sheets of stickers left and each sheet had ten stickers on it, we can find the total number of leftover stickers by multiplying the number of sheets by the number of stickers per sheet:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ sheets} \\times 10 \\text{ stickers per sheet} = 50 \\text{ stickers}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out the total number of stickers Xia had initially. This is the sum of the stickers she shared and the stickers she had left after sharing. Since she shared 100 stickers and had 50 stickers left, we add these two amounts together:\n\\[\n100 \\text{ stickers} + 50 \\text{ stickers} = 150 \\text{ stickers}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of stickers Xia had at the beginning is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{150}\n\\]",
