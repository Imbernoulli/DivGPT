They sold broccolis, carrots, spinach, and cauliflowers. After adding together all of their earnings, Maya found out that they had made $380. The organization made $57 from broccoli and the sales of the carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli. Then, their sales for the spinach is $16 more than half of the sales of carrots. How much did they make from cauliflower sales?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how much the organization made from cauliflower sales, we need to break down the total earnings step by step.\n\nFirst, we know the total earnings from all the vegetables is $380. We are given the following information:\n- Sales from broccoli: $57\n- Sales from carrots: twice as much as the sales from broccoli\n- Sales from spinach: $16 more than half of the sales from carrots\n\nLet's calculate the sales from each vegetable one by one.\n\n1. **Sales from carrots:**\n   Since the sales from carrots are twice as much as the sales from broccoli:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sales from carrots} = 2 \\times 57 = 114\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sales from spinach:**\n   The sales from spinach are $16 more than half of the sales from carrots. First, we find half of the sales from carrots:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Half of sales from carrots} = \\frac{114}{2} = 57\n   \\]\n   Then, we add $16 to this amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sales from spinach} = 57 + 16 = 73\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sales from cauliflower:**\n   We know the total earnings from all vegetables is $380. We can find the sales from cauliflower by subtracting the sum of the sales from broccoli, carrots, and spinach from the total earnings:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sales from cauliflower} = 380 - (57 + 114 + 73)\n   \\]\n\n   First, we calculate the sum of the sales from broccoli, carrots, and spinach:\n   \\[\n   57 + 114 + 73 = 244\n   \\]\n\n   Then, we subtract this sum from the total earnings:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sales from cauliflower} = 380 - 244 = 136\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount made from cauliflower sales is \\(\\boxed{136}\\).",
