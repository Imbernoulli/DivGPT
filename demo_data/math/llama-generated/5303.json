Therefore, the new value of each coin is:\n\\[\n15 + 15 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 15 + 10 = 25\n\\]\nSo, the new value of each coin is $25.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many coins James needs to sell to recoup his original investment.**\n\nTo find out how many coins James needs to sell to get back his original investment of $300, we divide the total cost by the new value of each coin:\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{25} = 12\n\\]\nSo, James needs to sell 12 coins to recoup his original investment.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
