        "To determine how many envelopes Cindy has left after giving some to her friends, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of envelopes Cindy gives to her friends.\n2. Subtract the number of given envelopes from the original number of envelopes Cindy has.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of envelopes Cindy gives to her friends. Cindy gives 3 envelopes to each of her 5 friends. Therefore, the total number of envelopes given is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ envelopes/friend} \\times 5 \\text{ friends} = 15 \\text{ envelopes} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of envelopes given from the original number of envelopes Cindy has. Cindy originally has 37 envelopes. After giving away 15 envelopes, the number of envelopes she has left is:\n\\[ 37 \\text{ envelopes} - 15 \\text{ envelopes} = 22 \\text{ envelopes} \\]\n\nThus, the number of envelopes Cindy has left is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",

So, we multiply the number of friends by the number of envelopes each friend receives:\n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\]\nThis means Cindy gives away 15 envelopes.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of envelopes given away from the original number of envelopes Cindy has. Cindy originally has 37 envelopes. So, we subtract 15 from 37:\n\\[ 37 - 15 = 22 \\]\nThis means Cindy has 22 envelopes left.\n\nTherefore, the number of envelopes Cindy has left is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",
        "To determine how many envelopes Cindy has left after giving some to her friends, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of envelopes Cindy gives away:**\n   Cindy gives 3 envelopes to each of her 5 friends. Therefore, we multiply the number of envelopes per friend by the number of friends:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ envelopes/friend} \\times 5 \\text{ friends} = 15 \\text{ envelopes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the number of given envelopes from the total number of envelopes Cindy originally has:**\n   Cindy starts with 37 envelopes.
