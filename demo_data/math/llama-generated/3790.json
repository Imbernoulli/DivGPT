        "To determine Cindy's earnings for teaching one math course in a month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the weekly hours spent teaching one math course:**\n   Cindy teaches 4 math courses and spends 48 hours a week in the classroom altogether. Therefore, the number of hours she spends teaching one math course per week is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{48 \\text{ hours}}{4 \\text{ courses}} = 12 \\text{ hours per course per week}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the monthly hours spent teaching one math course:**\n   There are 4 weeks in the month. So, the total number of hours she spends teaching one math course in a month is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ hours per course per week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 48 \\text{ hours per course per month}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Cindy's earnings for teaching one math course in a month:**\n   Cindy's hourly rate per class is $25.
