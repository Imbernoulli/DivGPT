        "To determine the total distance Francine drives to work for 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of days Francine works in one week:**\n   Francine does not go to work 3 days every week. Therefore, the number of days she works in one week is:\n   \\[\n   7 - 3 = 4 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of days Francine works in 4 weeks:**\n   Since she works 4 days each week, over 4 weeks she will work:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ days/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 16 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total distance Francine drives to work in 4 weeks:**\n   Francine drives 140 km each day.
