        "To find the total amount of money that the 60 students get in a day, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.\n\n1. Determine the number of students who receive $6 per day.\n   Since \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of the students receive $6 per day, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times 60 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, 40 students receive $6 per day.\n\n2. Determine the number of students who receive $4 per day.\n   The rest of the students receive $4 per day. Since the total number of students is 60 and 40 of them receive $6 per day, the number of students who receive $4 per day is:\n   \\[\n   60 - 40 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, 20 students receive $4 per day.\n\n3. Calculate the total amount of money received by the students who get $6 per day.\n   The total amount of money received by the 40 students who get $6 per day is:\n   \\[\n   40 \\times 6 = 240\n   \\]\n   So, the students who get $6 per day receive a total of $240 per day.\n\n4. Calculate the total amount of money received by the students who get $4 per day.\n   The total amount of money received by the 20 students who get $4 per day is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 4 = 80\n   \\]\n   So, the students who get $4 per day receive a total of $80 per day.\n\n5. Calculate the total amount of money received by all 60 students in a day.\n   The total amount of money received by all 60 students in a day is the sum of the amounts received by the students who get $6 per day and the students who get $4 per day:\n   \\[\n   240 + 80 = 320\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount of money that the 60 students get in a day is \\(\\boxed{320}\\).",

        "To find the total amount of money that the 60 students get in a day, we need to consider the imported information about the distribution of the allowances. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the number of students who receive $6 per day and the number who receive $4 per day:**\n\n   According to the survey, \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the students receive $6 per day. So, we calculate the number of these students as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times 60 = 40\n   \\]\n   Therefore, 40 students receive $6 per day.\n\n   The rest of the students receive $4 per day. Since the total number of students is 60, the number of students who receive $4 per day is:\n   \\[\n   60 - 40 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, 20 students receive $4 per day.\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of money received by the students who get $6 per day:**\n   \\[\n   40 \\times 6 = 240\n   \\]\n   So, the students who receive $6 per day get a total of $240 per day.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of money received by the students who get $4 per day:**\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 4 = 80\n   \\]\n   So, the students who receive $4 per day get a total of $80 per day.\n\n4. **Find the total amount of money received by all the students per day:**\n   \\[\n   240 + 80 = 320\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total amount of money that the 60 students get in a day is \\(\\boxed{320}\\).",
        "To determine the total amount of money the 60 students get in a day, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each part separately.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of students who receive $6 per day.
