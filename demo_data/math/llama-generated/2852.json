The remainder of the cookies will have both nuts and chocolate chips.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of cookies that have nuts:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\text{ of } 60 = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 60 = 15\n\\]\nSo, 15 cookies have nuts.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of cookies that have chocolate chips:\n\\[\n40\\% \\text{ of } 60 = 0.40 \\times 60 = 24\n\\]\nSo, 24 cookies have chocolate chips.\n\nThe total number of cookies is 60, so the number of cookies that have both nuts and chocolate chips is:\n\\[\n60 - 15 - 24 = 21\n\\]\nSo, 21 cookies have both nuts and chocolate chips.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of cookies that have nuts. This includes the 15 cookies that have only nuts and the 21 cookies that have both nuts and chocolate chips:\n\\[\n15 + 21 = 36\n\\]\nSo, 36 cookies have nuts.\n\nSince Maria uses 2 nuts per cookie, the total number of nuts she needs is:\n\\[\n36 \\times 2 = 72\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of nuts Maria needs is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).",

Since Maria is making 60 cookies, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 60 = 15\n\\]\nSo, 15 cookies have nuts in them.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of cookies that have chocolate chips.
