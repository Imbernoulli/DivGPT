        "To determine the final price of the shirt after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the selling price of the shirt before the discount.\n2. Apply the 50% discount to the selling price.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the selling price of the shirt before the discount.**\n\nThe store buys the shirt for $20 and charges a 30% profit. Therefore, the selling price is:\n\\[ 20 + 0.30 \\times 20 = 20 + 6 = 26 \\]\n\nSo, the selling price of the shirt is $26.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the 50% discount to the selling price.**\n\nThe shirt is on sale for 50% off the selling price. Therefore, the discount amount is:\n\\[ 0.50 \\times 26 = 13 \\]\n\nSubtract the discount amount from the selling price to get the final price:\n\\[ 26 - 13 = 13 \\]\n\nSo, the final price of the shirt is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",

        "To determine the final price of the shirt after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the selling price of the shirt before the discount.\n2. Apply the 50% discount to the selling price.\n\nFirst, let's find the selling price of the shirt before the discount. The store buys the shirt for $20 and charges a 30% profit on this cost. Therefore, the selling price is:\n\\[ 20 + 0.30 \\times 20 = 20 + 6 = 26 \\]\n\nNext, we apply the 50% discount to the selling price.
