        "To determine how many seconds later Jake will get to the ground floor compared to Austin, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to descend from the 9th floor to the ground floor.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Austin to reach the ground floor. The problem states that the elevator will take a minute to get to ground level. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, Austin will take:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Jake to reach the ground floor. Jake is descending 3 steps every second, and there are 30 steps per floor. Since Jake is starting from the 9th floor, he needs to descend 9 floors. Therefore, the total number of steps Jake needs to descend is:\n\\[\n9 \\text{ floors} \\times 30 \\text{ steps per floor} = 270 \\text{ steps}\n\\]\nSince Jake descends 3 steps every second, the time it takes for Jake to descend 270 steps is:\n\\[\n\\frac{270 \\text{ steps}}{3 \\text{ steps per second}} = 90 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many seconds later Jake will get to the ground floor compared to Austin. Since Austin takes 60 seconds and Jake takes 90 seconds, the difference in time is:\n\\[\n90 \\text{ seconds} - 60 \\text{ seconds} = 30 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jake will get to the ground floor \\(\\boxed{30}\\) seconds later than Austin.",

Since Jake descends 3 steps every second, the time it takes him to descend 270 steps is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{270 \\text{ steps}}{3 \\text{ steps per second}} = 90 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNow, we know that the elevator takes a minute to get to the ground floor. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the time it takes the elevator is:\n\n\\[ 60 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTo find out how many seconds later Jake gets to the ground floor compared to the elevator, we subtract the time it takes the elevator from the time it takes Jake:\n\n\\[ 90 \\text{ seconds} - 60 \\text{ seconds} = 30 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jake gets to the ground floor \\(\\boxed{30}\\) seconds later than the elevator.",
        "To determine how many seconds later Jake will get to the ground floor compared to Austin, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to descend from the 9th floor to the ground floor and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Austin to descend using the elevator:\n- The elevator takes 1 minute to get to the ground floor.\n- Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, Austin takes \\(60\\) seconds to descend.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Jake to descend using the stairs:\n- Jake descends 3 steps every second.\n- There are 30 steps per floor.\n- Jake needs to descend from the 9th floor to the ground floor, which is a total of 9 floors.\n- The total number of steps Jake needs to descend is \\(9 \\times 30 = 270\\) steps.\n- Since Jake descends 3 steps every second, the time it takes for Jake to descend is \\(\\frac{270}{3} = 90\\) seconds.\n\nNow, we find the difference in time between Jake and Austin:\n- Jake takes \\(90\\) seconds.\n- Austin takes \\(60\\) seconds.\n- The difference is \\(90 - 60 = 30\\) seconds.\n\nTherefore, Jake will get to the ground floor \\(\\boxed{30}\\) seconds later than Austin.",
