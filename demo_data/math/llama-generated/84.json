        "To determine how much money the truck driver makes if she drives for 10 hours, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance she drives in 10 hours.\n2. Determine the amount of gas she uses for this distance.\n3. Calculate the cost of the gas.\n4. Calculate her earnings from driving the distance.\n5. Subtract the cost of the gas from her earnings to find her net profit.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n1. **Calculate the total distance she drives in 10 hours:**\n   The driver's speed is 30 miles per hour. Therefore, in 10 hours, she drives:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ miles/hour} \\times 10 \\text{ hours} = 300 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the amount of gas she uses for this distance:**\n   The truck's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon. Therefore, the amount of gas used for 300 miles is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{300 \\text{ miles}}{10 \\text{ miles/gallon}} = 30 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the gas:**\n   The cost of gas is $2 per gallon. Therefore, the cost for 30 gallons is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ gallons} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/gallon} = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate her earnings from driving the distance:**\n   The driver is paid $0.50 per mile. Therefore, her earnings for 300 miles are:\n   \\[\n   300 \\text{ miles} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/mile} = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Subtract the cost of the gas from her earnings to find her net profit:**\n   Her net profit is her earnings minus the cost of the gas:\n   \\[\n   150 \\text{ dollars} - 60 \\text{ dollars} = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the truck driver makes \\(\\boxed{90}\\) dollars if she drives for 10 hours.",
