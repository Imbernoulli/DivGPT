So, we add these amounts together:\n\n\\[ 80 + 123 + 57 \\]\n\nWe can add these numbers step by step:\n\n\\[ 80 + 123 = 203 \\]\n\\[ 203 + 57 = 260 \\]\n\nSo, Jesse used 260 building blocks in total. Next, we know that Jesse has 84 building blocks left. To find out how many building blocks he started with, we add the number of blocks he has left to the total number of blocks he used:\n\n\\[ 260 + 84 = 344 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jesse started with \\(\\boxed{344}\\) building blocks.",
