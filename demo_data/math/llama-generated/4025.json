        "To determine how many more presents Santana has to buy in the second half of the year than the first half of the year, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify the months in each half of the year:\n- The first half of the year includes January, February, March, April, May, and June.\n- The second half of the year includes July, August, September, October, November, and December.\n\nNext, we count the number of brothers' birthdays in each half of the year:\n- In the first half of the year, 3 brothers have birthdays in March.\n- In the second half of the year, 1 brother has a birthday in October, 1 brother has a birthday in November, and 2 brothers have birthdays in December. So, the total number of birthdays in the second half of the year is \\(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of birthday presents Santana buys in each half of the year:\n- In the first half of the year, she buys \\(3\\) birthday presents.\n- In the second half of the year, she buys \\(4\\) birthday presents.\n\nNext, we need to consider the Christmas presents. Since each brother gets a Christmas present, Santana buys \\(7\\) Christmas presents in total. We need to determine how many of these Christmas presents are given in the first half of the year and how many are given in the second half of the year. Since Christmas is in December, all \\(7\\) Christmas presents are given in the second half of the year.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of presents Santana buys in each half of the year:\n- In the first half of the year, she buys \\(3\\) birthday presents and \\(0\\) Christmas presents, so the total is \\(3 + 0 = 3\\).\n- In the second half of the year, she buys \\(4\\) birthday presents and \\(7\\) Christmas presents, so the total is \\(4 + 7 = 11\\).\n\nFinally, we find the difference in the number of presents between the second half of the year and the first half of the year:\n\\[11 - 3 = 8\\]\n\nTherefore, Santana has to buy \\(\\boxed{8}\\) more presents in the second half of the year than the first half of the year.",
        "To determine how many more presents Santana has to buy in the second half of the year than the first half of the year, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of birthday presents Santana buys in the first half of the year. The first half of the year includes January, February, March, April, May, and June. Santana has 3 brothers who have birthdays in March. Therefore, she buys 3 birthday presents in the first half of the year.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of birthday presents Santana buys in the second half of the year. The second half of the year includes July, August, September, October, November, and December. Santana has 1 brother who has a birthday in October, 1 brother who has a birthday in November, and 2 brothers who have birthdays in December. Therefore, she buys \\(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\\) birthday presents in the second half of the year.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of Christmas presents Santana buys. Since Christmas is in December, she buys a Christmas present for each of her 7 brothers. Therefore, she buys 7 Christmas presents.\n\nNext, let's find out the total number of presents Santana buys in the first half of the year by adding the birthday presents and the Christmas presents she buys in the first half of the year. Since she buys 3 birthday presents and 0 Christmas presents in the first half of the year, she buys \\(3 + 0 = 3\\) presents in the first half of the year.\n\nNow, let's find out the total number of presents Santana buys in the second half of the year by adding the birthday presents and the Christmas presents she buys in the second half of the year. Since she buys 4 birthday presents and 7 Christmas presents in the second half of the year, she buys \\(4 + 7 = 11\\) presents in the second half of the year.\n\nFinally, let's determine how many more presents Santana has to buy in the second half of the year than the first half of the year by subtracting the total number of presents she buys in the first half of the year from the total number of presents she buys in the second half of the year. Therefore, she has to buy \\(11 - 3 = 8\\) more presents in the second half of the year than the first half of the year.\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",

Therefore, she buys 7 Christmas presents.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of presents Santana buys in each half:\n- In the first half, she buys 3 birthday presents and 0 Christmas presents (since Christmas is in the second half), so the total number of presents in the first half is \\(3 + 0 = 3\\).\n- In the second half, she buys 4 birthday presents and 7 Christmas presents, so the total number of presents in the second half is \\(4 + 7 = 11\\).\n\nFinally, we find out how many more presents Santana has to buy in the second half compared to the first half:\n\\[11 - 3 = 8\\]\n\nThus, Santana has to buy \\(\\boxed{8}\\) more presents in the second half of the year than the first half of the year.",
