Let's define the number of Oreos Jordan has as \\( J \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, James has 7 more than 4 times the number of Oreos Jordan has. Therefore, the number of Oreos James has can be expressed as:\n\\[ 4J + 7 \\]\n\nWe also know that the total number of Oreos is 52. This means the sum of the Oreos Jordan has and the Oreos James has is 52. So, we can write the equation:\n\\[ J + (4J + 7) = 52 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 5J + 7 = 52 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( J \\), we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 5J = 45 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 5:\n\\[ J = 9 \\]\n\nNow that we know Jordan has 9 Oreos, we can find out how many Oreos James has by substituting \\( J = 9 \\) back into the expression for the number of Oreos James has:\n\\[ 4J + 7 = 4(9) + 7 = 36 + 7 = 43 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of Oreos James has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{43} \\]",
