        "To determine how much more money Max's mom gave him on Thursday compared to Tuesday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of money Max's mom gave him on Wednesday.\n2. Calculate the amount of money Max's mom gave him on Thursday.\n3. Find the difference between the amount given on Thursday and the amount given on Tuesday.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of money Max's mom gave him on Wednesday. She gave him 5 times as much money as she gave him on Tuesday. Since she gave him $8 on Tuesday, we multiply $8 by 5:\n\\[\n5 \\times 8 = 40\n\\]\nSo, Max's mom gave him $40 on Wednesday.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of money Max's mom gave him on Thursday. She gave him $9 more than she gave him on Wednesday. Since she gave him $40 on Wednesday, we add $9 to $40:\n\\[\n40 + 9 = 49\n\\]\nSo, Max's mom gave him $49 on Thursday.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the amount given on Thursday and the amount given on Tuesday. We subtract the amount given on Tuesday from the amount given on Thursday:\n\\[\n49 - 8 = 41\n\\]\nSo, Max's mom gave him $41 more on Thursday than she gave him on Tuesday.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{41}\n\\]",
