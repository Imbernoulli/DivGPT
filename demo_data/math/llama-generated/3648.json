        "First, we need to determine how many nickels Ray initially has. Since each nickel is worth 5 cents, we can calculate the number of nickels by dividing the total amount of money by the value of each nickel:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{175}{5} = 35\n\\]\n\nSo, Ray initially has 35 nickels.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many cents Ray gives to Peter and Randi. Ray gives 30 cents to Peter. Since he gives twice as many cents to Randi as he gave to Peter, we can calculate the amount given to Randi as follows:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 30 = 60\n\\]\n\nSo, Ray gives 60 cents to Randi.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many nickels Peter and Randi each receive. Since each nickel is worth 5 cents, we can calculate the number of nickels Peter receives by dividing the amount given to Peter by the value of each nickel:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{5} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, Peter receives 6 nickels.\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the number of nickels Randi receives by dividing the amount given to Randi by the value of each nickel:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{5} = 12\n\\]\n\nSo, Randi receives 12 nickels.\n\nFinally, we need to determine how many more nickels Randi has than Peter. We do this by subtracting the number of nickels Peter receives from the number of nickels Randi receives:\n\n\\[\n12 - 6 = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, Randi has \\(\\boxed{6}\\) more nickels than Peter.",
