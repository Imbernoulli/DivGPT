According to the problem, he ran for twice as long as he played basketball. Therefore, we multiply the number of hours he played basketball by 2:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ hours} \\times 2 = 20 \\text{ hours} \\]\nSo, Kenny ran for 20 hours.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many hours Kenny practiced on the trumpet. The problem states that he practiced on the trumpet for twice as long as he ran. Therefore, we multiply the number of hours he ran by 2:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ hours} \\times 2 = 40 \\text{ hours} \\]\nSo, Kenny practiced on the trumpet for 40 hours.\n\nThus, the number of hours Kenny practiced on the trumpet last week is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
