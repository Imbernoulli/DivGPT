A friend knows that Kim has a bunch of shiny new earrings that she loves. She agrees to give Kim 9 gumballs for each pair of earrings. On the first day, Kim brings her 3 pairs of earrings. On the second she brings her twice as many. On the third day, she brings 1 less than she brought on the second day. If Kim eats 3 gumballs a day, how many days will the gumballs last?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many days the gumballs will last, we need to calculate the total number of gumballs Kimberly receives over the three days and then divide that by the number of gumballs she eats each day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of gumballs Kimberly receives each day:\n- On the first day, Kimberly brings her 3 pairs of earrings. Since she gets 9 gumballs for each pair, she receives:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 9 = 27 \\text{ gumballs}\n  \\]\n- On the second day, Kimberly brings her twice as many pairs of earrings as she did on the first day. So she brings:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ pairs of earrings}\n  \\]\n  Therefore, she receives:\n  \\[\n  6 \\times 9 = 54 \\text{ gumballs}\n  \\]\n- On the third day, Kimberly brings her 1 less pair of earrings than she did on the second day. So she brings:\n  \\[\n  6 - 1 = 5 \\text{ pairs of earrings}\n  \\]\n  Therefore, she receives:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 9 = 45 \\text{ gumballs}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we sum the total number of gumballs Kimberly receives over the three days:\n\\[\n27 + 54 + 45 = 126 \\text{ gumballs}\n\\]\n\nKimberly eats 3 gumballs each day. To find out how many days the gumballs will last, we divide the total number of gumballs by the number of gumballs she eats each day:\n\\[\n126 \\div 3 = 42 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the gumballs will last \\(\\boxed{42}\\) days.",

Determine how many days the gumballs will last based on Kim's daily consumption.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of pairs of earrings Kim brings each day.**\n\n- On the first day, Kim brings 3 pairs of earrings.\n- On the second day, Kim brings twice as many pairs as she did on the first day, which is \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) pairs.\n- On the third day, Kim brings 1 less pair than she did on the second day, which is \\(6 - 1 = 5\\) pairs.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of pairs of earrings Kim brings over the three days.**\n\n\\[3 + 6 + 5 = 14\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of gumballs Kim receives.**\n\nSince Kim gets 9 gumballs for each pair of earrings, the total number of gumballs she receives is:\n\n\\[14 \\times 9 = 126\\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine how many days the gumballs will last based on Kim's daily consumption.**\n\nKim eats 3 gumballs a day, so the number of days the gumballs will last is:\n\n\\[126 \\div 3 = 42\\]\n\nTherefore, the gumballs will last \\(\\boxed{42}\\) days.",
        "To determine how many days the gumballs will last, we need to calculate the total number of gumballs Kimberly receives over the three days and then divide that total by the number of gumballs she eats each day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pairs of earrings Kimberly brings each day:\n- On the first day, Kimberly brings 3 pairs of earrings.\n- On the second day, Kimberly brings twice as many pairs as the first day. Therefore, she brings \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) pairs.\n- On the third day, Kimberly brings 1 less pair than she brought on the second day. Therefore, she brings \\(6 - 1 = 5\\) pairs.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of pairs of earrings Kimberly brings over the three days:\n\\[3 + 6 + 5 = 14\\]\n\nSince Kimberly gets 9 gumballs for each pair of earrings, the total number of gumballs she receives is:\n\\[14 \\times 9 = 126\\]\n\nKimberly eats 3 gumballs a day. To find out how many days the gumballs will last, we divide the total number of gumballs by the number of gumballs she eats each day:\n\\[126 \\div 3 = 42\\]\n\nTherefore, the gumballs will last \\(\\boxed{42}\\) days.",
