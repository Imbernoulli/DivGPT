        "To determine how long it would take John to go to the bathroom 6 times, we start by finding out how long it takes him to go to the bathroom once. We know that it takes him 20 minutes to go to the bathroom 8 times.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time it takes for one trip to the bathroom:\n\\[\n\\frac{20 \\text{ minutes}}{8 \\text{ times}} = 2.5 \\text{ minutes per trip}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it would take for 6 trips. We do this by multiplying the time per trip by 6:\n\\[\n2.5 \\text{ minutes per trip} \\times 6 \\text{ trips} = 15 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it would take John \\boxed{15} minutes to go to the bathroom 6 times.",
