        "To determine the total combined amount of time Carlotta spends practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing in the final stage performance, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the time spent practicing:**\n   Carlotta spends 3 minutes practicing for every 1 minute she sings. Given that her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, we can calculate the time spent practicing as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent practicing} = 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the time spent throwing temper tantrums:**\n   Carlotta spends 5 minutes throwing temper tantrums for every 1 minute she sings. Given that her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, we can calculate the time spent throwing temper tantrums as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time spent throwing temper tantrums} = 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total time spent:**\n   To find the total combined amount of time Carlotta spends practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing, we add up the time spent on each activity:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time spent} = \\text{Time spent singing} + \\text{Time spent practicing} + \\text{Time spent throwing temper tantrums}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we found:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time spent} = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total combined amount of time Carlotta spends practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing in the final stage performance is \\(\\boxed{54}\\) minutes.",

Determine the time Carlotta spends throwing temper tantrums.\n   For every 1 minute she sings, she spends an additional 5 minutes throwing temper tantrums. Therefore, if she sings for 6 minutes, she spends:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ minutes} \\times 5 \\text{ minutes/minute} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n   throwing temper tantrums.\n\n4. Calculate the total combined amount of time spent practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing.\n   Add the time spent singing, practicing, and throwing temper tantrums:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ minutes} + 18 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 54 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total combined amount of time Carlotta spends practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing in the final stage performance is \\(\\boxed{54}\\)."
