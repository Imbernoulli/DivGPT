        "To determine Pat's profit, we need to calculate both his earnings from taking photos and his expenses on boat fuel. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of photos Pat takes:**\n   - Pat sees a shark every 10 minutes.\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - Therefore, in one hour, Pat sees \\( \\frac{60}{10} = 6 \\) sharks.\n   - Since Pat hunts for 5 hours, the total number of sharks he sees is \\( 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\).\n   - Since he earns $15 for each photo, his total earnings are \\( 30 \\times 15 = 450 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the boat fuel:**\n   - The boat fuel costs $50 per hour.\n   - Since Pat hunts for 5 hours, the total cost of the boat fuel is \\( 50 \\times 5 = 250 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate the profit:**\n   - Profit is calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the total earnings.\n   - Therefore, Pat's profit is \\( 450 - 250 = 200 \\) dollars.\n\nThe amount of money Pat can expect to make in profit is \\(\\boxed{200}\\).",

Subtract the total cost of the boat fuel from the total earnings to find the profit.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of photos Pat takes in 5 hours.**\n\nPat sees a shark every 10 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in one hour he sees:\n\\[ \\frac{60}{10} = 6 \\text{ sharks} \\]\n\nSince he hunts for 5 hours, the total number of sharks he sees is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ sharks} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total earnings from the photos.**\n\nPat earns $15 for each photo. Therefore, his total earnings from 30 photos is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 15 = 450 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the boat fuel for 5 hours.**\n\nThe boat fuel costs $50 per hour. So, for 5 hours, the total cost is:\n\\[ 50 \\times 5 = 250 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the total cost of the boat fuel from the total earnings to find the profit.**\n\nThe profit is:\n\\[ 450 - 250 = 200 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, Pat can expect to make a profit of \\(\\boxed{200}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine Pat's profit from shark hunting for 5 hours, we need to calculate both his earnings and his expenses, and then find the difference between the two.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Pat's earnings. Pat earns $15 for every photo he takes. He sees a shark about every 10 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he sees:\n\\[ \\frac{60}{10} = 6 \\text{ sharks per hour} \\]\nIf he hunts for 5 hours, he will see:\n\\[ 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ sharks} \\]\nTherefore, his total earnings are:\n\\[ 30 \\times 15 = 450 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate Pat's expenses.
