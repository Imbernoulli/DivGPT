Therefore, we can calculate the number of Muscovy ducks as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Muscovy ducks} = 50\\% \\times 40 = \\frac{50}{100} \\times 40 = 0.5 \\times 40 = 20\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of female Muscovy ducks.**\n\nWe know that 30 percent of the Muscovy ducks are female. Therefore, we can calculate the number of female Muscovy ducks as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of female Muscovy ducks} = 30\\% \\times 20 = \\frac{30}{100} \\times 20 = 0.3 \\times 20 = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of female Muscovy ducks is \\boxed{6}.",
