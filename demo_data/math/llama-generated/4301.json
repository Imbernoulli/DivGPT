        "To determine how many minutes John won the race by, we first need to calculate the time it took John to complete the 5-mile race.\n\nJohn's running speed is 15 miles per hour.

To find out how many minutes John won the race by, we subtract John's time from the time it took the next fastest guy:\n\\[ 23 \\text{ minutes} - 20 \\text{ minutes} = 3 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nTherefore, John won the race by \\(\\boxed{3}\\) minutes.",
