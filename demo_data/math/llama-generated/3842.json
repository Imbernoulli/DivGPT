Since Dina has 28 crayons, we can calculate Jacob's crayons as follows:\n\\[ 28 - 2 = 26 \\]\nSo, Jacob has 26 crayons.\n\nNext, we add the number of crayons that Wanda, Dina, and Jacob have:\n\\[ 62 + 28 + 26 \\]\n\nWe can add these numbers step by step. First, add Wanda's and Dina's crayons:\n\\[ 62 + 28 = 90 \\]\n\nThen, add Jacob's crayons to the result:\n\\[ 90 + 26 = 116 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of crayons they have is:\n\\[ \\boxed{116} \\]",
