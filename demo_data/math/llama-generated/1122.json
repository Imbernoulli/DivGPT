        "To determine how many rocks were in the bucket, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relationship between the weight of the rocks and the money Jim earns.\n2. Use the given average weight of a rock to find the total weight of the rocks.\n3. Calculate the number of rocks based on the total weight.\n\nFirst, we know that the rock collector pays Jim $4 for every pound of rocks, and Jim makes $60 off the sale. Therefore, we can find the total weight of the rocks by dividing the total amount of money Jim makes by the price per pound:\n\\[\n\\text{Total weight of the rocks} = \\frac{60}{4} = 15 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that the average weight of a rock is 1.5 pounds. To find the number of rocks, we divide the total weight of the rocks by the average weight of a rock:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of rocks} = \\frac{15}{1.5} = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of rocks in the bucket is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

Therefore, the number of rocks in the pail is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of rocks} = \\frac{\\text{Total weight}}{\\text{Average weight per rock}} = \\frac{15}{1.5} = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of rocks in the bucket is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

        "To determine how many rocks were in the bucket, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the relationship between the weight of the rocks and the money received from the sale.\n2. Use the given information to set up an equation.\n3. Solve the equation for the total weight of the rocks.\n4. Determine the number of rocks based on the average weight of each rock.\n\nFirst, let's denote the total weight of the rocks as \\( W \\) pounds. According to the problem, the rock collector pays $4 for every pound of rocks. Therefore, the total amount of money Jim receives is \\( 4W \\) dollars. We know from the problem that Jim makes $60 off the sale, so we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n4W = 60\n\\]\nTo find the total weight of the rocks, we solve for \\( W \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[\nW = \\frac{60}{4} = 15\n\\]\nSo, the total weight of the rocks is 15 pounds. Next, we need to determine how many rocks were in the bucket. We know that the average weight of each rock is 1.5 pounds. Let \\( R \\) be the number of rocks. Then, the total weight of the rocks can also be expressed as \\( 1.5R \\) pounds. Since we already know the total weight is 15 pounds, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n1.5R = 15\n\\]\nTo find the number of rocks, we solve for \\( R \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.5:\n\\[\nR = \\frac{15}{1.5} = 10\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of rocks in the bucket is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
