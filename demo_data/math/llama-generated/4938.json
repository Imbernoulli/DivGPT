Subtract the number of episodes lost from the original total number of episodes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of episodes Corey originally downloaded. Since each season has 16 episodes, and the first series has 12 seasons, the total number of episodes in the first series is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ seasons} \\times 16 \\text{ episodes/season} = 192 \\text{ episodes} \\]\n\nSimilarly, the second series has 14 seasons, so the total number of episodes in the second series is:\n\\[ 14 \\text{ seasons} \\times 16 \\text{ episodes/season} = 224 \\text{ episodes} \\]\n\nAdding these together gives the total number of episodes originally downloaded:\n\\[ 192 \\text{ episodes} + 224 \\text{ episodes} = 416 \\text{ episodes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of episodes lost. Since Corey lost 2 episodes from each season for both series, the number of episodes lost from the first series is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ seasons} \\times 2 \\text{ episodes/season} = 24 \\text{ episodes} \\]\n\nAnd the number of episodes lost from the second series is:\n\\[ 14 \\text{ seasons} \\times 2 \\text{ episodes/season} = 28 \\text{ episodes} \\]\n\nAdding these together gives the total number of episodes lost:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ episodes} + 28 \\text{ episodes} = 52 \\text{ episodes} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of episodes lost from the original total number of episodes to find out how many episodes remained:\n\\[ 416 \\text{ episodes} - 52 \\text{ episodes} = 364 \\text{ episodes} \\]\n\nThus, the number of episodes that remained after the computer's mechanical failure is:\n\\[ \\boxed{364} \\]",

Calculate the total number of episodes Corey initially downloaded.\n2. Determine the number of episodes lost due to the mechanical failure.\n3. Subtract the number of episodes lost from the initial total.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of episodes initially downloaded.**\n\nThe first series has 12 seasons, and each season has 16 episodes.\n\\[\n12 \\text{ seasons} \\times 16 \\text{ episodes/season} = 192 \\text{ episodes}\n\\]\n\nThe second series has 14 seasons, and each season has 16 episodes.\n\\[\n14 \\text{ seasons} \\times 16 \\text{ episodes/season} = 224 \\text{ episodes}\n\\]\n\nAdding the episodes from both series gives:\n\\[\n192 \\text{ episodes} + 224 \\text{ episodes} = 416 \\text{ episodes}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of episodes lost due to the mechanical failure.**\n\nCorey lost 2 episodes from each season in both series. For the first series:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ seasons} \\times 2 \\text{ episodes/season} = 24 \\text{ episodes}\n\\]\n\nFor the second series:\n\\[\n14 \\text{ seasons} \\times 2 \\text{ episodes/season} = 28 \\text{ episodes}\n\\]\n\nAdding the episodes lost from both series gives:\n\\[\n24 \\text{ episodes} + 28 \\text{ episodes} = 52 \\text{ episodes}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of episodes lost from the initial total.**\n\nThe total number of episodes remaining after the mechanical failure is:\n\\[\n416 \\text{ episodes} - 52 \\text{ episodes} = 364 \\text{ episodes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of episodes that remained after the computer's mechanical failure is \\boxed{364}."
