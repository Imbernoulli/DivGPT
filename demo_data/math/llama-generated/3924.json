Subtract the amount of water already poured from the total capacity of the tank to find out how many more gallons are needed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of water Aubriella has already poured into the tank. She pours water at a rate of 1 gallon every 20 seconds. We need to find out how many gallons she pours in 6 minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 6 minutes is equal to:\n\\[ 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many 20-second intervals are in 360 seconds:\n\\[ 360 \\div 20 = 18 \\]\n\nSo, Aubriella has poured 18 gallons of water into the tank. The tank has a total capacity of 50 gallons. To find out how many more gallons are needed to fill the tank, we subtract the amount of water already poured from the total capacity:\n\\[ 50 - 18 = 32 \\]\n\nTherefore, Aubriella has to pour \\(\\boxed{32}\\) more gallons into the tank to fill it.",
        "To determine how many more gallons Aubriella needs to pour into the fish tank to fill it, we start by calculating how much water she has already poured into the tank.\n\nFirst, we convert the time she spent pouring water from minutes to seconds because the rate is given in seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we multiply:\n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ minutes} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds per minute} = 360 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the rate at which she pours water to find out how many gallons she poured in 360 seconds.
