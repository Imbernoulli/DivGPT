        "To determine the total distance run by Mercedes and Davonte, we start by calculating the distance each person ran individually.\n\nFirst, we know that Jonathan ran 7.5 kilometers. Since Mercedes ran twice that distance, we calculate her distance as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 7.5 = 15 \\text{ kilometers}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Davonte ran 2 kilometers farther than Mercedes. Therefore, we calculate his distance as follows:\n\\[\n15 + 2 = 17 \\text{ kilometers}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the total distance run by Mercedes and Davonte, we add their individual distances together:\n\\[\n15 + 17 = 32 \\text{ kilometers}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total distance run by Mercedes and Davonte is \\boxed{32}.",
