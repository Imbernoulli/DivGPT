        "To determine how many gumballs are remaining in the bowl, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of gumballs Pedro has.\n2. Find the total number of gumballs in the bowl.\n3. Determine how many gumballs Pedro takes out.\n4. Calculate the number of gumballs remaining in the bowl.\n\nFirst, we know that Alicia has 20 gumballs. Pedro has that many gumballs plus an additional number of gumballs equal to three times the number Alicia has. Therefore, we can calculate the number of gumballs Pedro has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of gumballs Pedro has} = 20 + 3 \\times 20 = 20 + 60 = 80\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of gumballs in the bowl by adding the number of gumballs Alicia has to the number of gumballs Pedro has:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of gumballs} = 20 + 80 = 100\n\\]\n\nThen, Pedro takes out 40% of the gumballs to eat. To find out how many gumballs Pedro takes out, we calculate 40% of the total number of gumballs:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of gumballs Pedro takes out} = 0.40 \\times 100 = 40\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of gumballs remaining in the bowl by subtracting the number of gumballs Pedro takes out from the total number of gumballs:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of gumballs remaining} = 100 - 40 = 60\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of gumballs remaining in the bowl is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",

Find the total number of gumballs in the bowl.\n3. Determine how many gumballs Pedro takes out.\n4. Subtract the number of gumballs Pedro takes out from the total number of gumballs in the bowl.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Alicia has 20 gumballs, and Pedro has 20 gumballs plus an additional number of gumballs equal to three times the number Alicia has.

Pedro takes out 40% of the gumballs in the bowl. So, we calculate 40% of 100:\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 100 = 40 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of gumballs Pedro takes out from the total number of gumballs in the bowl to find out how many gumballs are remaining:\n\\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \\]\n\nThus, the number of gumballs remaining in the bowl is:\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",

Alicia has 20 gumballs, and Pedro has 20 gumballs plus an additional number of gumballs equal to three times the number Alicia has. Therefore, Pedro has:\n\\[ 20 + 3 \\times 20 = 20 + 60 = 80 \\text{ gumballs} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of gumballs in the bowl before Pedro takes any out. The total number of gumballs is the sum of the gumballs Alicia has and the gumballs Pedro has:\n\\[ 20 + 80 = 100 \\text{ gumballs} \\]\n\nNow, we determine how many gumballs Pedro takes out. Pedro takes out 40% of the gumballs in the bowl:\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 100 = 40 \\text{ gumballs} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the number of gumballs remaining in the bowl by subtracting the number of gumballs Pedro takes out from the total number of gumballs:\n\\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \\text{ gumballs} \\]\n\nThus, the number of gumballs remaining in the bowl is:\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]",
