        "To determine how much Lee earned mowing lawns last week, we need to consider both the money he earned from mowing the lawns and the tips he received.\n\nFirst, we calculate the earnings from mowing the lawns. Lee mowed 16 lawns, and he charges $33 per lawn. Therefore, the total earnings from mowing the lawns is:\n\\[\n16 \\times 33\n\\]\n\nWe can break this multiplication down for clarity:\n\\[\n16 \\times 33 = 16 \\times (30 + 3) = (16 \\times 30) + (16 \\times 3)\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate each term separately:\n\\[\n16 \\times 30 = 480\n\\]\n\\[\n16 \\times 3 = 48\n\\]\n\nAdding these results together gives:\n\\[\n480 + 48 = 528\n\\]\n\nSo, Lee earned $528 from mowing the lawns.\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of tips he received. Lee received a $10 tip from each of three customers. Therefore, the total tips is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 10 = 30\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the earnings from mowing the lawns and the tips to find the total amount Lee earned last week:\n\\[\n528 + 30 = 558\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount Lee earned mowing lawns last week is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{558}\n\\]",
