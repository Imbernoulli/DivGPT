        "To determine the total number of cows on the ranch, we need to calculate the number of cows each farm has and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many cows Happy Good Healthy Family has. We know that We the People has 17 cows. According to the problem, Happy Good Healthy Family has two more than three times the number of cows We the People has. We can express this relationship with the following calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cows Happy Good Healthy Family has} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of cows We the People has} + 2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the number of cows We the People has into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cows Happy Good Healthy Family has} = 3 \\times 17 + 2\n\\]\n\nNext, we perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 17 = 51\n\\]\n\nThen we add 2 to the result:\n\n\\[\n51 + 2 = 53\n\\]\n\nSo, Happy Good Healthy Family has 53 cows. Now, we need to find the total number of cows on the ranch by adding the number of cows from both farms:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of cows} = \\text{Number of cows We the People has} + \\text{Number of cows Happy Good Healthy Family has}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the numbers we know, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of cows} = 17 + 53\n\\]\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\n\\[\n17 + 53 = 70\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cows on the ranch is \\boxed{70}.",
