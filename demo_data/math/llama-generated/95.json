        "To determine the percentage chance that Carlos picks a peanut cluster, we first need to find out how many peanut clusters are in the box. We start by calculating the number of each type of chocolate.\n\n1. **Caramels**: There are 3 caramels.\n2. **Nougats**: The number of nougats is twice the number of caramels. Therefore, the number of nougats is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3 = 6\n   \\]\n3. **Truffles**: The number of truffles is equal to the number of caramels plus 6. Therefore, the number of truffles is:\n   \\[\n   3 + 6 = 9\n   \\]\n\nNext, we sum the number of caramels, nougats, and truffles to find out how many chocolates are not peanut clusters:\n\\[\n3 + 6 + 9 = 18\n\\]\n\nSince the total number of chocolates in the box is 50, the number of peanut clusters is:\n\\[\n50 - 18 = 32\n\\]\n\nTo find the percentage chance that Carlos picks a peanut cluster, we use the formula for percentage:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\text{number of peanut clusters}}{\\text{total number of chocolates}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{32}{50} \\right) \\times 100 = 64\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage chance that Carlos picks a peanut cluster is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{64}\n\\]",
