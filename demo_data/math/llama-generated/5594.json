        "Let's start by determining the initial number of red and blue marbles in the box. We know there are 50 marbles in total and 20 of them are white. Since the number of red and blue marbles is equal, we can let the number of red marbles be \\( r \\) and the number of blue marbles be \\( r \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 20 + r + r = 50 \\]\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[ 20 + 2r = 50 \\]\n\nSubtracting 20 from both sides, we have:\n\n\\[ 2r = 30 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we find:\n\n\\[ r = 15 \\]\n\nSo, there are 15 red marbles and 15 blue marbles.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many marbles Jack removes. Jack removes a number of marbles equal to double the difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles. The difference between the number of white marbles and the number of blue marbles is:\n\n\\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \\]\n\nDouble this difference is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Jack removes 10 marbles. To find out how many marbles are left in the box, we subtract the number of marbles Jack removes from the original total number of marbles:\n\n\\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of marbles left in the box is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
