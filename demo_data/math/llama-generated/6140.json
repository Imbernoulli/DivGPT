        "To determine how many straws each piglet ate, we start by calculating how many straws Troy fed to the adult pigs. Since he fed \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of the straws to the adult pigs, we can calculate this as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 300 = 180\n\\]\n\nSo, Troy fed 180 straws to the adult pigs. Since the total number of straws is 300, the number of straws fed to the piglets is:\n\n\\[\n300 - 180 = 120\n\\]\n\nTroy fed an equal number of straws to the piglets, so he also fed 120 straws to the piglets. Given that there are 20 piglets, the number of straws each piglet ate is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120}{20} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, each piglet ate \\(\\boxed{6}\\) straws.",

Since he fed an equal number of straws to the piglets as he did to the adult pigs, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Straws fed to piglets} = 300 - 180 = 120\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many straws each piglet ate.
