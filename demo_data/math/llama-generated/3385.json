        "To determine how many pizza doughs Bruce can make in a week, we need to break the problem down into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. Calculate the number of batches of pizza dough Bruce can make in one day.\n   Bruce uses 5 sacks of flour per day, and each sack of flour can make 15 batches of pizza dough. Therefore, the number of batches he can make in one day is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ sacks/day} \\times 15 \\text{ batches/sack} = 75 \\text{ batches/day}\n   \\]\n\n2.
