Sum the remaining fruits on all the trees.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of fruits on all the trees.**\n\nDulce's father has 8 orange trees, and each tree has 200 fruits.\n\\[\n8 \\times 200 = 1600\n\\]\nSo, the total number of fruits on all the trees is 1600.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many fruits Dulce picks from each tree.**\n\nDulce picks \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the oranges from each tree.\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times 200 = \\frac{2 \\times 200}{5} = \\frac{400}{5} = 80\n\\]\nSo, Dulce picks 80 fruits from each tree.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of fruits remaining on each tree after Dulce picks.**\n\nIf Dulce picks 80 fruits from each tree, the number of fruits remaining on each tree is:\n\\[\n200 - 80 = 120\n\\]\nSo, there are 120 fruits remaining on each tree.\n\n**Step 4: Sum the remaining fruits on all the trees.**\n\nSince there are 8 trees and each tree has 120 fruits remaining, the total number of fruits remaining is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 120 = 960\n\\]\nSo, the total number of fruits remaining in all the trees is \\(\\boxed{960}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of fruits remaining on Dulce's father's farm after she picks some, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of fruits on all the trees initially.\n2. Determine how many fruits Dulce picks from each tree.\n3. Calculate how many fruits remain on each tree after Dulce picks.\n4. Find the total number of fruits remaining on all the trees.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of fruits on all the trees initially:**\n   Dulce's father has 8 orange trees, and each tree has 200 fruits.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total fruits initially} = 8 \\times 200 = 1600\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many fruits Dulce picks from each tree:**\n   Dulce picks \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the oranges from each tree.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fruits picked from each tree} = 200 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 200 \\times 0.4 = 80\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate how many fruits remain on each tree after Dulce picks:**\n   Since Dulce picks 80 fruits from each tree, the number of fruits remaining on each tree is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fruits remaining per tree} = 200 - 80 = 120\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the total number of fruits remaining on all the trees:**\n   There are 8 trees, and each tree has 120 fruits remaining.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total fruits remaining} = 8 \\times 120 = 960\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of fruits remaining in all the trees is \\(\\boxed{960}\\)."
