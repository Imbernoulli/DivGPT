Determine how much milk is left after the kids have consumed their share.\n3. Calculate how much milk Daisy uses to cook with.\n4. Determine how much milk is left after cooking.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much milk is consumed by Daisy's kids. The cow provides 16 cups of milk per day, and 75% of this milk is consumed by Daisy's kids:\n\\[\n0.75 \\times 16 = 12 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\nSo, Daisy's kids consume 12 cups of milk per day. This means the amount of milk left after the kids have consumed their share is:\n\\[\n16 - 12 = 4 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\nNext, Daisy uses 50% of the remaining milk to cook with. So, we calculate 50% of the 4 cups of milk:\n\\[\n0.50 \\times 4 = 2 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\nThis means Daisy uses 2 cups of milk to cook with. Therefore, the amount of milk left over after cooking is:\n\\[\n4 - 2 = 2 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\nSo, the amount of milk left over is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",

Therefore, the amount of milk consumed by the kids is:\n\\[ 16 \\times 0.75 = 12 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount of milk consumed by the kids from the total amount of milk provided to find out how much milk is left:\n\\[ 16 - 12 = 4 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nDaisy uses 50% of the remaining milk to cook with. Therefore, the amount of milk she uses to cook with is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 0.50 = 2 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the amount of milk Daisy uses to cook with from the remaining milk to find out how much milk is left over:\n\\[ 4 - 2 = 2 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nSo, the amount of milk left over is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
