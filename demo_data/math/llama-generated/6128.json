        "To determine how many students identified chess or basketball as their favorite sport, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students who like basketball.\n2. Calculate the number of students who like chess.\n3. Add the number of students who like basketball and the number of students who like chess.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of students who like basketball. We know that 40% of the 250 students like basketball. So, we multiply 250 by 40% (or 0.40):\n\n\\[\n250 \\times 0.40 = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of students who like chess. We know that 10% of the 250 students like chess. So, we multiply 250 by 10% (or 0.10):\n\n\\[\n250 \\times 0.10 = 25\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of students who like basketball and the number of students who like chess:\n\n\\[\n100 + 25 = 125\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students who identified chess or basketball as their favorite sport is \\boxed{125}.",
