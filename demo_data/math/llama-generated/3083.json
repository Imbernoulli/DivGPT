        "To determine the profit the taco truck made, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tacos that can be made with 100 pounds of beef.\n2. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the tacos.\n3. Calculate the total cost of making all the tacos.\n4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of tacos that can be made with 100 pounds of beef.**\n\nThe taco truck uses 0.25 pounds of beef per taco. Therefore, the total number of tacos that can be made is:\n\\[\n\\frac{100 \\text{ pounds}}{0.25 \\text{ pounds per taco}} = 400 \\text{ tacos}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the tacos.**\n\nEach taco is sold for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:\n\\[\n400 \\text{ tacos} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per taco} = 800 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of making all the tacos.**\n\nEach taco takes $1.5 to make. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[\n400 \\text{ tacos} \\times 1.5 \\text{ dollars per taco} = 600 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.**\n\nThe profit is:\n\\[\n800 \\text{ dollars} - 600 \\text{ dollars} = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the profit the taco truck made is \\(\\boxed{200}\\).",

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:\n   \\[\n   800 \\text{ dollars} - 600 \\text{ dollars} = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the profit the taco truck made is \\(\\boxed{200}\\).",
