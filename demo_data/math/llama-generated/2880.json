Therefore, the number of bars of soap he uses in one year is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ bar/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 12 \\text{ bars/year} \\]\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of bars of soap Elias uses in two years.\nSince Elias uses 12 bars of soap in one year, the number of bars of soap he uses in two years is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ bars/year} \\times 2 \\text{ years} = 24 \\text{ bars} \\]\n\nStep 3: Determine the total cost for the bars of soap over two years.\nEach bar of soap costs $4, so the total cost for 24 bars of soap is:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ bars} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars/bar} = 96 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Elias spends on bars of soap in two years is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",
        "To determine how much Elias spends on bars of soap in two years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of bars of soap Elias uses in one year.\n2. Multiply the number of bars of soap used in one year by the cost of one bar of soap.\n3. Multiply the result by 2 to find the total cost for two years.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Elias uses 1 bar of soap every month. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of bars of soap he uses in one year is:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ bar/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 12 \\text{ bars/year}\n   \\]\n\n2. Each bar of soap costs $4. Therefore, the total cost of soap for one year is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ bars/year} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars/bar} = 48 \\text{ dollars/year}\n   \\]\n\n3. To find the total cost for two years, we multiply the annual cost by 2:\n   \\[\n   48 \\text{ dollars/year} \\times 2 \\text{ years} = 96 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total amount Elias spends on bars of soap in two years is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{96}\n\\]",
        "To determine how much Elias spends on bars of soap in two years, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. Calculate the number of bars of soap Elias uses in one year.\n   - Elias uses 1 bar of soap every month.\n   - There are 12 months in a year.\n   - Therefore, the number of bars of soap Elias uses in one year is:\n     \\[\n     1 \\text{ bar/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 12 \\text{ bars/year}\n     \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of bars of soap Elias uses in two years.\n   - Since he uses 12 bars of soap in one year, in two years he will use:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ bars/year} \\times 2 \\text{ years} = 24 \\text{ bars}\n     \\]\n\n3. Calculate the total cost of the bars of soap in two years.\n   - Each bar of soap costs $4.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for 24 bars of soap is:\n     \\[\n     24 \\text{ bars} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars/bar} = 96 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Elias spends on bars of soap in two years is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).",

Calculate the number of bars of soap Elias uses in two years.\n3. Determine the total cost of the bars of soap over two years.\n\nFirst, we know that Elias uses one bar of soap every month.
