His animal transport truck holds 20 head of cattle.  Traveling at 60 miles per hour, what is the total driving time, in hours, it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total driving time required to transport all 400 head of cattle to higher ground, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of trips required:**\n   - The truck holds 20 head of cattle.\n   - The rancher needs to move 400 head of cattle.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of trips} = \\frac{400 \\text{ head of cattle}}{20 \\text{ head per trip}} = 20 \\text{ trips}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the distance for each trip:**\n   - Each trip is 60 miles one way.\n   - Therefore, a round trip (to the destination and back) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Round trip distance} = 60 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 120 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total distance for all trips:**\n   - The rancher makes 20 trips.\n   - Each trip is 120 miles.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance} = 20 \\text{ trips} \\times 120 \\text{ miles per trip} = 2400 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the total driving time:**\n   - The truck travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour.\n   - The total distance to be traveled is 2400 miles.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total driving time} = \\frac{2400 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 40 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total driving time it will take to transport all of his cattle to higher ground is \\(\\boxed{40}\\) hours.",
