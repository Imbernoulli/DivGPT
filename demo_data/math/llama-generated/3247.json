        "To determine the total number of apples bought by two men and three women, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of apples each woman bought.\n2. Calculate the total number of apples bought by the men.\n3. Calculate the total number of apples bought by the women.\n4. Add the total number of apples bought by the men and the women.\n\nFirst, we know that each man bought 30 apples. According to the problem, each woman bought 20 more apples than each man. Therefore, the number of apples each woman bought is:\n\\[ 30 + 20 = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of apples bought by the two men. Since each man bought 30 apples, the total number of apples bought by the two men is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total number of apples bought by the three women. Since each woman bought 50 apples, the total number of apples bought by the three women is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 50 = 150 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total number of apples bought by the men and the women to find the overall total:\n\\[ 60 + 150 = 210 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of apples bought by the two men and three women is:\n\\[ \\boxed{210} \\]",

Since each man bought 30 apples, the total number of apples bought by the two men is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total number of apples bought by the three women. Since each woman bought 50 apples, the total number of apples bought by the three women is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 50 = 150 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total number of apples bought by the men and the women to find the total number of apples bought by all five people:\n\\[ 60 + 150 = 210 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of apples bought by the two men and three women is:\n\\[ \\boxed{210} \\]",

Add the totals from steps 3 and 4 to find the overall total.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Each man bought 30 apples.\n\nNext, we know that each woman bought 20 more apples than each man. Therefore, the number of apples each woman bought is:\n\\[ 30 + 20 = 50 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of apples bought by the two men. Since each man bought 30 apples, the total for the men is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of apples bought by the three women. Since each woman bought 50 apples, the total for the women is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 50 = 150 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total number of apples bought by the men and the women to find the overall total:\n\\[ 60 + 150 = 210 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of apples bought by the two men and three women is:\n\\[ \\boxed{210} \\]",

Add the total number of apples bought by the men and the women.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many apples each woman bought. We know that each man bought 30 apples, which is 20 less than the number of apples bought by each woman.
