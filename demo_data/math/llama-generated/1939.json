        "To determine the total price the family will pay for admission to the amusement park, we need to calculate the cost for the adult tickets and the cost for the children's tickets separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost for the adult tickets:\n- The cost of one adult ticket is $22.\n- There are 2 adults in the family.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the adult tickets is \\( 22 \\times 2 = 44 \\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost for the children's tickets:\n- The cost of one child's ticket is $7.\n- There are 2 children in the family.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the children's tickets is \\( 7 \\times 2 = 14 \\) dollars.\n\nNow, we add the total cost for the adult tickets and the total cost for the children's tickets to find the total price the family will pay:\n- The total cost for the adult tickets is $44.\n- The total cost for the children's tickets is $14.\n- Therefore, the total price the family will pay is \\( 44 + 14 = 58 \\) dollars.\n\nThus, the total price the family will pay for admission is \\(\\boxed{58}\\).",
