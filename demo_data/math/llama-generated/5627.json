Therefore, we can calculate the number of cups of flour as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cups of flour} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Number of eggs} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the number of cups of flour and the number of eggs together to find the total:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of cups of flour and eggs} = \\text{Number of cups of flour} + \\text{Number of eggs} = 30 + 60 = 90\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of cups of flour and eggs that Dante uses altogether is \\boxed{90}.",
