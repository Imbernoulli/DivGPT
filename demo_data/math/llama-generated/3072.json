        "To determine how many minutes Adah practiced the cello on the other days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the total practice time from hours to minutes:**\n   Adah practiced for a total of 7.5 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply:\n   \\[\n   7.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 450 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total practice time for the 2 days:**\n   Adah practiced for 86 minutes each day for 2 days. Therefore, we multiply:\n   \\[\n   86 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 172 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the practice time for the other days:**\n   Subtract the total practice time for the 2 days from the total practice time for the week:\n   \\[\n   450 \\text{ minutes} - 172 \\text{ minutes} = 278 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of minutes Adah practiced on the other days is \\boxed{278}.",
        "To find out how many minutes Adah practiced on the other days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the total practice time from hours to minutes.
