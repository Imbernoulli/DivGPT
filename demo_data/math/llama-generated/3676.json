        "To determine the total number of nail polishes that Karen and Heidi have together, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many nail polishes Heidi has.\n2. Find out how many nail polishes Karen has.\n3. Add the number of nail polishes Heidi and Karen have.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many nail polishes Heidi has. Heidi has 5 more nail polishes than Kim. Since Kim has 12 nail polishes, we can calculate Heidi's nail polishes as follows:\n\\[\n12 + 5 = 17\n\\]\nSo, Heidi has 17 nail polishes.\n\nNext, let's find out how many nail polishes Karen has. Karen has 4 fewer nail polishes than Kim. Since Kim has 12 nail polishes, we can calculate Karen's nail polishes as follows:\n\\[\n12 - 4 = 8\n\\]\nSo, Karen has 8 nail polishes.\n\nNow, we add the number of nail polishes Heidi and Karen have together:\n\\[\n17 + 8 = 25\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of nail polishes that Karen and Heidi have together is \\boxed{25}.",
