Since each dog is fed twice a day, the daily consumption per dog is:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ g/meal} \\times 2 \\text{ meals/day} = 500 \\text{ g/day} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total daily consumption for all 4 dogs is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ dogs} \\times 500 \\text{ g/dog/day} = 2000 \\text{ g/day} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many days the total amount of dog food will last.**\n\nWe divide the total amount of dog food by the daily consumption to find out how many days it will last:\n\\[ 100000 \\text{ g} \\div 2000 \\text{ g/day} = 50 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nThus, the dog food will last for \\(\\boxed{50}\\) days.",
        "To determine how many days the dog food will last, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total daily food consumption for all the dogs:**\n   - Each dog consumes 250 grams per meal.\n   - Each dog is fed twice a day.\n   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one dog is:\n     \\[\n     250 \\text{ grams/meal} \\times 2 \\text{ meals/day} = 500 \\text{ grams/day}\n     \\]\n   - Aunt Gemma has four dogs.
