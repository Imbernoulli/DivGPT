Therefore, we calculate his speed for these days as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed on Tuesday} = 10 + 0.5 \\times 10 = 10 + 5 = 15 \\text{ meters per hour}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Speed on Wednesday} = 15 \\text{ meters per hour}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Speed on Thursday} = 15 \\text{ meters per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, on Friday, Harry runs 60% faster than he did on Thursday. Therefore, we calculate his speed on Friday as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed on Friday} = 15 + 0.6 \\times 15 = 15 + 9 = 24 \\text{ meters per hour}\n\\]\n\nThus, Harry's running speed on Friday is \\boxed{24} meters per hour.",

        "To determine how fast Harry ran on Friday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Harry's running speed on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday:**\n   - On Monday, Harry ran at a speed of 10 meters per hour.\n   - From Tuesday to Thursday, he ran 50% faster than on Monday.\n   - To find 50% of 10 meters per hour:\n     \\[\n     0.50 \\times 10 = 5 \\text{ meters per hour}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, his speed on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday is:\n     \\[\n     10 + 5 = 15 \\text{ meters per hour}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Harry's running speed on Friday:**\n   - On Friday, Harry ran 60% faster than he did on Thursday.\n   - To find 60% of 15 meters per hour:\n     \\[\n     0.60 \\times 15 = 9 \\text{ meters per hour}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, his speed on Friday is:\n     \\[\n     15 + 9 = 24 \\text{ meters per hour}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Harry ran \\(\\boxed{24}\\) meters per hour on Friday.",
        "To determine how fast Harry ran on Friday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Harry's running speed on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.\n2. Use that speed to find out how fast he ran on Friday.\n\nFirst, let's find Harry's running speed on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. On Monday, he ran at a speed of 10 meters per hour. Since he ran 50% faster on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, we need to calculate 50% of 10 meters per hour and add it to the original speed.\n\n\\[ 50\\% \\text{ of } 10 \\text{ meters per hour} = 0.50 \\times 10 = 5 \\text{ meters per hour} \\]\n\nSo, his speed on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday is:\n\n\\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \\text{ meters per hour} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how fast Harry ran on Friday. On Friday, he ran 60% faster than he did on Thursday. We calculate 60% of 15 meters per hour and add it to the speed on Thursday.\n\n\\[ 60\\% \\text{ of } 15 \\text{ meters per hour} = 0.60 \\times 15 = 9 \\text{ meters per hour} \\]\n\nSo, his speed on Friday is:\n\n\\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \\text{ meters per hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, Harry ran \\(\\boxed{24}\\) meters per hour on Friday.",

Use the speed on Thursday to find Harry's running speed on Friday.\n\nFirst, we know Harry's running speed on Monday is 10 meters per hour. From Tuesday to Thursday, he ran 50% faster than on Monday. Therefore, we need to calculate 50% of 10 meters per hour and add it to 10 meters per hour.\n\nThe calculation for 50% of 10 meters per hour is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 0.5 = 5 \\text{ meters per hour} \\]\n\nAdding this to the original speed on Monday gives:\n\\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \\text{ meters per hour} \\]\n\nSo, Harry ran 15 meters per hour on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.\n\nNext, we need to find out how fast Harry ran on Friday.
