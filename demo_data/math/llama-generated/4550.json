        "To determine the number of Muscovy ducks, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

There are 4 more Muscovy ducks than Cayugas:\n   \\[\n   M = C + 4\n   \\]\n\n2. There are 3 more than twice as many Cayugas as Khaki Campbells:\n   \\[\n   C = 2K + 3\n   \\]\n\n3. The total number of ducks is 90:\n   \\[\n   M + C + K = 90\n   \\]\n\nFirst, we substitute the expression for \\( C \\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\\[\nM = (2K + 3) + 4\n\\]\nSimplify this to:\n\\[\nM = 2K + 7\n\\]\n\nNext, we substitute the expressions for \\( M \\) and \\( C \\) into the third equation:\n\\[\n(2K + 7) + (2K + 3) + K = 90\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n5K + 10 = 90\n\\]\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( K \\):\n\\[\n5K = 80\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 5 to solve for \\( K \\):\n\\[\nK = 16\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( K \\), we can find \\( C \\) using the second equation:\n\\[\nC = 2K + 3 = 2(16) + 3 = 32 + 3 = 35\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find \\( M \\) using the first equation:\n\\[\nM = C + 4 = 35 + 4 = 39\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of Muscovy ducks is \\(\\boxed{39}\\).",
