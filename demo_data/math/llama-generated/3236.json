        "To determine how much Carl will need to spend on gas for his road trip to the Grand Canyon, we need to calculate the total amount of gas he will use for the round trip and then find out the cost of that gas.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Carl will travel for the round trip:\n- One way, the distance is 60 city miles and 200 highway miles.\n- Therefore, for a round trip, the distance is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times (60 \\text{ city miles} + 200 \\text{ highway miles}) = 2 \\times 260 = 520 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n  break this down into city and highway miles:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 60 \\text{ city miles} = 120 \\text{ city miles}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 200 \\text{ highway miles} = 400 \\text{ highway miles}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of gas used for the city miles and the highway miles separately:\n- The car gets 30 miles per gallon in the city. Therefore, the gas used for the city miles is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{120 \\text{ city miles}}{30 \\text{ miles per gallon}} = 4 \\text{ gallons}\n  \\]\n- The car gets 40 miles per gallon on the highway. Therefore, the gas used for the highway miles is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{400 \\text{ highway miles}}{40 \\text{ miles per gallon}} = 10 \\text{ gallons}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we add the gas used for the city miles and the highway miles to find the total gas used for the round trip:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ gallons} + 10 \\text{ gallons} = 14 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost of the gas by multiplying the total amount of gas used by the cost per gallon:\n\\[\n14 \\text{ gallons} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars per gallon} = 42 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Carl will need to spend \\(\\boxed{42}\\) dollars on gas for his road trip to the Grand Canyon.",

        "To determine how much Carl will need to spend on gas for his road trip to the Grand Canyon, we need to calculate the total amount of gas he will use and then find the cost of that gas.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance for the round trip:\n- One way to the Grand Canyon is 60 city miles and 200 highway miles.\n- Therefore, the round trip distance is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times (60 \\text{ city miles} + 200 \\text{ highway miles}) = 2 \\times 260 \\text{ miles} = 520 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much gas is required for the city and highway portions of the trip separately.\n\n**City-full distance:**\n- The car gets 30 miles per gallon in cities.\n- The one-way city distance is 60 miles.\n- Therefore, the gas needed for one way in city is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{30 \\text{ miles per gallon}} = 2 \\text{ gallons}\n  \\]\n- For the round trip, the city gas needed is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 2 \\text{ gallons} = 4 \\text{ gallons}\n  \\]\n\n**Highway distance:**\n- The car gets 40 miles per gallon on the highway.\n- The one-way highway distance is 200 miles.\n- Therefore, the gas needed for one way on the highway is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{200 \\text{ miles}}{40 \\text{ miles per gallon}} = 5 \\text{ gallons}\n  \\]\n- For the round trip, the highway gas needed is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 5 \\text{ gallons} = 10 \\text{ gallons}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we add the city and highway gas needed to find the total gas required for the round trip:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ gallons} + 10 \\text{ gallons} = 14 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the cost of the gas:\n- gas costs $3.00 per gallon.\n- Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[\n14 \\text{ gallons} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars per gallon} = 42 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, Carl will need to spend \\(\\boxed{42}\\) dollars on gas for his road trip to the Grand Canyon.",
        "To determine how much Carl will need to spend on gas for his road trip to the Grand Canyon, we need to calculate the total amount of gas he will use for the round trip and then find out the cost of that gas.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance for the round trip:\n- One way to the Grand Canyon is 60 city miles and 200 highway miles.\n- Therefore, the round trip distance is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times (60 + 200) = 2 \\times 260 = 520 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we need to break down the round trip distance into city miles and highway miles:\n- City miles: \\(2 \\times 60 = 120\\) miles\n- Highway miles: \\(2 \\times 200 = 400\\) miles\n\nNow, we calculate the amount of gas needed for the city miles and the highway miles separately:\n- For city miles, the car gets 30 miles per gallon.
