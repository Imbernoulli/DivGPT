        "To determine how many tennis balls go into each container, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of tennis balls James gives away:**\n   James starts with 100 tennis balls and gives away half of them.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of tennis balls given away} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of tennis balls James keeps:**\n   After giving away 50 tennis balls, James has the other half left.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of tennis balls kept} = 100 - 50 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many tennis balls go into each container:**\n   James puts the 50 tennis balls he keeps into 5 large containers. To find out how many tennis balls go into each container, we divide the total number of tennis balls by the number of containers.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of tennis balls per container} = \\frac{50}{5} = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of tennis balls in each container is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

Therefore, the number of tennis balls he gives away is:\n\\[ 100 \\div 2 = 50 \\]\n\nThis means that the number of tennis balls he has left is:\n\\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \\]\n\nNext, he puts these 50 tennis balls into 5 large containers. To find out how many tennis balls go into each container, we divide the remaining tennis balls by the number of containers:\n\\[ 50 \\div 5 = 10 \\]\n\nSo, the number of tennis balls that go into each container is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",
