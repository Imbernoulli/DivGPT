        "To determine the total number of flies eaten every day in the swamp, we need to follow the food chain step by step, starting from the gharials and working our way down to the flies.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of fish eaten by the gharials:**\n   Each gharial needs to eat 15 fish per day. Since there are 9 gharials, the total number of fish eaten by the gharials in one day is:\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ gharials} \\times 15 \\text{ fish/gharial} = 135 \\text{ fish}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of frogs eaten by the fish:**\n   Each fish needs to eat 8 frogs per day. Since there are 135 fish, the total number of frogs eaten by the fish in one day is:\n   \\[\n   135 \\text{ fish} \\times 8 \\text{ frogs/fish} = 1080 \\text{ frogs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of flies eaten by the frogs:**\n   Each frog needs to eat 30 flies per day. Since there are 1080 frogs, the total number of flies eaten by the frogs in one day is:\n   \\[\n   1080 \\text{ frogs} \\times 30 \\text{ flies/frog} = 32400 \\text{ flies}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of flies eaten every day in the swamp is \\(\\boxed{32400}\\).",
