        "To determine how much money Agatha had initially, we need to add up all her expenses and the amount of money she has left. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of the frame: $15.\n2. Identify the cost of the front wheel: $25.\n3. Identify the amount of money left after the expenses: $20.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of money spent on the frame and the front wheel:\n\\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we add the amount of money left to the total amount spent to find out how much money Agatha had initially:\n\\[ 40 + 20 = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Agatha had at first is \\(\\boxed{60}\\)."
