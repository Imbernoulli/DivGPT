        "To determine how many dogs Mariel is walking, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of legs each type of animal has.\n   - Each dog has 4 legs.\n   - Each human has 2 legs.\n\n2. Determine the total number of legs contribute by the other dog walker and their 3 dogs.\n   - The other dog walker has 2 legs.\n   - Each of the 3 dogs has 4 legs, so the total number of legs for the dogs is \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n   - Therefore, the total number of legs contribute by the other dog walker and their 3 dogs is \\(2 + 12 = 14\\).\n\n3. Subtract the number of legs contribute by the other dog walker and their 3 dogs from the total number of legs tangled up in leashes to find the number of legs contribute by Mariel and her dogs.\n   - The total number of legs tangled up in leashes is 36.\n   - The number of legs contribute by the other dog walker and their 3 dogs is 14.\n   - Therefore, the number of legs contribute by Mariel and her dogs is \\(36 - 14 = 22\\).\n\n4. Determine the number of dogs Mariel is walking by subtracting the number of legs contribute by Mariel from the number of legs contribute by Mariel and her dogs.\n   - Mariel is a human, so she has 2 legs.\n   - Therefore, the number of legs contribute by Mariel is 2.\n   - The number of legs contribute by Mariel and her dogs is 22.\n   - Therefore, the number of legs contribute by Mariel's dogs is \\(22 - 2 = 20\\).\n\n5. Since each dog has 4 legs, the number of dogs Mariel is walking is \\(20 \\div 4 = 5\\).\n\nThus, the number of dogs Mariel is walking is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

Let \\(d\\) represent the number of dogs Mariel is walking. Each dog has 4 legs, so the total number of legs contributed by Mariel and her dogs is:\n\\[ 2 + 4d \\]\n\nWe set up the equation:\n\\[ 2 + 4d = 22 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\(d\\), we first subtract 2 from both sides:\n\\[ 4d = 20 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 4:\n\\[ d = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mariel is walking \\(\\boxed{5}\\) dogs.",

We know that the total number of legs is 36, and this includes the legs of the dogs and the legs of the two dog walkers.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of legs contributed by the two dog walkers. Each dog walker has 2 legs, so:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ dog walkers} \\times 2 \\text{ legs per dog walker} = 4 \\text{ legs} \\]\n\nNext, we know that there are 3 dogs belonging to the other dog walker, and each dog has 4 legs, so:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ dogs} \\times 4 \\text{ legs per dog} = 12 \\text{ legs} \\]\n\nNow, let's add the legs of the two dog walkers and the legs of the other dog's dogs:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ legs} + 12 \\text{ legs} = 16 \\text{ legs} \\]\n\nWe are given that the total number of legs tangent up in the leashes is 36. Therefore, the number of legs contributed by Mariel and her dogs is:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ legs} - 16 \\text{ legs} = 20 \\text{ legs} \\]\n\nSince each of Mariel's dogs has 4 legs, we can find the number of dogs she is walking by dividing the total number of her dog's legs by the number of legs per dog:\n\\[ \\frac{20 \\text{ legs}}{4 \\text{ legs per dog}} = 5 \\text{ dogs} \\]\n\nThus, the number of dogs Mariel is walking is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",

Define the variables:\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the number of dogs Mariel is walking.\n   - There are 3 other dogs.\n   - There are 2 dog walkers (Mariel and the other dog walker).\n\n3.

Set up the equation for the total number of legs:\n   - The total number of legs tangled up is the sum of the legs from the dogs and the legs from the humans.\n   - According to the problem, this total is 36.\n   - Therefore, the equation is:\n     \\[\n     4d + 12 + 4 = 36\n     \\]\n\n6. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   4d + 16 = 36\n   \\]\n\n7.

Let \\( d \\) represent the number of dogs Mariel is walking.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of legs contributed by the humans:\n- Mariel has 2 legs.\n- The other dog walker has 2 legs.\n- Total legs from humans: \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\) legs.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of legs contributed by the dogs:\n- The other dog walker has 3 dogs, and each dog has 4 legs: \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\) legs.\n- Mariel has \\( d \\) dogs, and each dog has 4 legs: \\( 4d \\) legs.\n- Total legs from dogs: \\( 12 + 4d \\) legs.\n\nThe total number of legs tangled up in leashes is given as 36. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ (human legs)} + 12 \\text{ (other dog's legs)} + 4d \\text{ (Mariel's dogs' legs)} = 36\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[\n4 + 12 + 4d = 36\n\\]\n\\[\n16 + 4d = 36\n\\]\n\nSubtract 16 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( d \\):\n\\[\n4d = 20\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4 to solve for \\( d \\):\n\\[\nd = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, Mariel is walking \\(\\boxed{5}\\) dogs.",
        "To determine how many dogs Mariel is walking, we start by identifying the total number of legs involved in the tangle. We know there are 36 legs in total.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of legs the other dog walker and their dogs contribute:\n- The other dog walker has 2 legs.\n- Each of their 3 dogs has 4 legs.\n\nSo, the total number of legs from the other dog walker and their dogs is:\n\\[\n2 + (3 \\times 4) = 2 + 12 = 14\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of legs from the other dog walker and their dogs from the total number of legs to find out how many legs Mariel and her dogs contribute:\n\\[\n36 - 14 = 22\n\\]\n\nSince Mariel is a dog walker, she herself has 2 legs. Therefore, the number of legs from Mariel's dogs is:\n\\[\n22 - 2 = 20\n\\]\n\nEach dog has 4 legs, so the number of dogs Mariel is walking is:\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{4} = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of dogs Mariel is walking is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many dogs Mariel is walking, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of legs each type of animal has:**\n   - Each dog has 4 legs.\n   - Each human has 2 legs.\n\n2. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**\n   - Mariel and the other dog walker each have 2 legs.\n   - The other dog walker has 3 dogs, each with 4 legs.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of dogs Mariel is walking.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of legs:**\n   - Mariel's legs: \\( 2 \\)\n   - Other dog walker's legs: \\( 2 \\)\n   - Legs of the other dog walker's 3 dogs: \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\)\n   - Legs of Mariel's dogs: \\( x \\times 4 = 4x \\)\n\n4. **Sum the legs and set the equation equal to 36:**\n   \\[\n   2 + 2 + 12 + 4x = 36\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the equation:**\n   \\[\n   16 + 4x = 36\n   \\]\n\n6. **Isolate the term with \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   4x = 36 - 16\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4x = 20\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{20}{4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mariel is walking \\(\\boxed{5}\\) dogs."
