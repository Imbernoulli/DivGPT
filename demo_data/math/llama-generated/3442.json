        "To determine the phone bill at the end of the month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the duration of each call in minutes:**\n   Each call lasts 1 hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, each call is:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ hour} = 60 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the cost of each call:**\n   Each minute costs five cents. Therefore, the cost of one call is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ minutes} \\times 0.05 \\text{ dollars/minute} = 3 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of calls in a week:**\n   Ayla talks to 50 customers each week. Thus, the total number of calls in a week is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ calls}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost for one week:**\n   The cost for each call is $3, so the total cost for 50 calls in a week is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ calls} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/call} = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the number of weeks in a month:**\n   There are typically 4 weeks in a month. Therefore, the number of weeks in a month is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total cost for the month:**\n   The total cost for one week is $150, so the total cost for 4 weeks is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ weeks} \\times 150 \\text{ dollars/week} = 600 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the phone bill at the end of the month is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{600}\n\\]",
