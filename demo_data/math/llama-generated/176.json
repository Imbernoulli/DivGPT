        "To determine how much Lyle will pay for 4 notebooks, we first need to find out the cost of one notebook. According to the problem, a notebook costs three times as much as a pen. Given that a pen costs $1.50, we can calculate the cost of one notebook as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of one notebook} = 3 \\times \\text{Cost of one pen} = 3 \\times 1.50 = 4.50\n\\]\n\nNow that we know the cost of one notebook is $4.50, we can find out how much Lyle will pay for 4 notebooks by multiplying the cost of one notebook by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of 4 notebooks} = 4 \\times \\text{Cost of one notebook} = 4 \\times 4.50 = 18.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Lyle will pay \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars for 4 notebooks.",
