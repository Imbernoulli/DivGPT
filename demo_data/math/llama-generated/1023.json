        "To determine how much longer Ann's trip takes than Mary, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to slide down their respective hills and then find the difference in those times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes for Mary to slide down her hill. Mary's hill is 630 feet long, and she slides at a speed of 90 feet per minute. The time \\( t_M \\) it takes for Mary to slide down the hill is given by the formula:\n\\[\nt_M = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{630 \\text{ feet}}{90 \\text{ feet/minute}} = 7 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes for Ann to slide down her hill. Ann's hill is 800 feet long, and she slides at a speed of 40 feet per minute. The time \\( t_A \\) it takes for Ann to slide down the hill is given by the formula:\n\\[\nt_A = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{800 \\text{ feet}}{40 \\text{ feet/minute}} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in time between Ann's trip and Mary's trip:\n\\[\nt_A - t_M = 20 \\text{ minutes} - 7 \\text{ minutes} = 13 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Ann's trip takes \\(\\boxed{13}\\) minutes longer than Mary's trip.",
