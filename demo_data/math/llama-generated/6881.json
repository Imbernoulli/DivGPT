Determine the total number of mini tissue boxes brought by all groups combined.\n3. Calculate the total number of tissues based on the total number of mini tissue boxes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of mini tissue boxes brought by each group:\n- The first group has 9 students, so they bring \\(9\\) mini tissue boxes.\n- The second group has 10 students, so they bring \\(10\\) mini tissue boxes.\n- The third group has 11 students, so they bring \\(11\\) mini tissue boxes.\n\nNext, we add the number of mini tissue boxes from all three groups:\n\\[9 + 10 + 11 = 30\\]\n\nEach mini tissue box contains 40 tissues. Therefore, the total number of tissues is:\n\\[30 \\times 40 = 1200\\]\n\nSo, the total number of tissues the kindergartner groups bring together is \\(\\boxed{1200}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of tissues the kindergartner groups bring together, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students in all three groups.\n2. Determine the total number of mini tissue boxes needed.\n3. Calculate the total number of tissues in all the mini tissue boxes.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students in all three groups.**\n\nThe number of students in the first group is 9.\nThe number of students in the second group is 10.\nThe number of students in the third group is 11.\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[ 9 + 10 + 11 = 30 \\]\n\nSo, there are 30 students in total.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of mini tissue boxes needed.**\n\nSince each student needs one mini tissue box, the total number of mini tissue boxes needed is equal to the total number of students, which is 30.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of tissues in all the mini tissue boxes.**\n\nEach mini tissue box contains 40 tissues. Therefore, the total number of tissues is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 40 = 1200 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of tissues the kindergartner groups bring together is \\(\\boxed{1200}\\)."
