        "To determine how long it takes John to read 3 books, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate John's reading speed relative to his brother:**\n   John reads 60% faster than his brother. This means John reads at a speed that is 160% of his brother's speed (100% + 60%).\n\n2. **Determine the brother's reading speed:**\n   The brother takes 8 hours to read one book. Therefore, his reading speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brother's reading speed} = \\frac{1 \\text{ book}}{8 \\text{ hours}} = \\frac{1}{8} \\text{ books per hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate John's reading speed:**\n   Since John reads at 160% of his brother's speed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{John's reading speed} = 1.6 \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\text{ books per hour} = \\frac{1.6}{8} \\text{ books per hour} = \\frac{16}{80} \\text{ books per hour} = \\frac{2}{10} \\text{ books per hour} = \\frac{1}{5} \\text{ books per hour}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the time it takes John to read one book:**\n   Since John's reading speed is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) books per hour, the time it takes him to read one book is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time to read one book} = \\frac{1 \\text{ book}}{\\frac{1}{5} \\text{ books per hour}} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the time it takes John to read 3 books:**\n   If it takes John 5 hours to read one book, then the time it takes him to read 3 books is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time to read 3 books} = 3 \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 15 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it would take John \\(\\boxed{15}\\) hours to read 3 books.",
