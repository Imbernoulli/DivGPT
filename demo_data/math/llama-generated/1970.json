We know that each milkshake requires 4 ounces of milk and 12 ounces of ice cream. Blake has 72 ounces of milk and 192 ounces of ice cream.\n\nThe number of milkshakes Blake can make is limited by the ingredient that runs out first. Let's find out how many milkshakes he can make with the milk:\n\\[\n\\frac{72 \\text{ ounces of milk}}{4 \\text{ ounces of milk per milkshake}} = 18 \\text{ milkshakes}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find out how many milkshakes he can make with the ice cream:\n\\[\n\\frac{192 \\text{ ounces of ice cream}}{12 \\text{ ounces of ice cream per milkshake}} = 16 \\text{ milkshakes}\n\\]\n\nSince Blake can only make as many milkshakes as the limiting ingredient allows, he can make 16 milkshakes.\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of milk used for the 16 milkshakes:\n\\[\n16 \\text{ milkshakes} \\times 4 \\text{ ounces of milk per milkshake} = 64 \\text{ ounces of milk}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount of milk used from the initial amount of milk to find out how much milk will be left over:\n\\[\n72 \\text{ ounces of milk} - 64 \\text{ ounces of milk} = 8 \\text{ ounces of milk}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of milk left over when Blake is done is \\boxed{8}.",
        "To determine how much milk Blake will have left over after making milkshakes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of milk and ice cream needed for one milkshake:**\n   - Milk per milkshake: 4 ounces\n   - Ice cream per milkshake: 12 ounces\n\n2. **Determine how many milkshakes Blake can make with the available ice cream:**\n   - Total ice cream available: 192 ounces\n   - Ice cream needed per milkshake: 12 ounces\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of milkshakes} = \\frac{192 \\text{ ounces}}{12 \\text{ ounces per milkshake}} = 16 \\text{ milkshakes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of milk needed for the 16 milkshakes:**\n   - Milk needed per milkshake: 4 ounces\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total milk needed} = 16 \\text{ milkshakes} \\times 4 \\text{ ounces per milkshake} = 64 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how much milk will be left over:**\n   - Total milk available: 72 ounces\n   - Total milk needed: 64 ounces\n   \\[\n   \\text{Milk left over} = 72 \\text{ ounces} - 64 \\text{ ounces} = 8 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the amount of milk left over when Blake is done making milkshakes is \\(\\boxed{8}\\) ounces.",

We do this by dividing the total amount of each ingredient by the amount needed per milkshake:\n- Blake has 72 ounces of milk.
