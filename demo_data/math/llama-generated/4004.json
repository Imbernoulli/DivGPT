        "To determine Gillian's phone bill for the entire next year after a 10% increase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the new monthly phone bill after the 10% increase.\n2. Multiply the new monthly phone bill by 12 to find the total annual bill.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the new monthly phone bill.**\n\nThe original monthly phone bill is $50. A 10% increase means that the new monthly bill is the original bill plus 10% of the original bill. We can calculate 10% of $50 as follows:\n\n\\[ 10\\% \\text{ of } 50 = 0.10 \\times 50 = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the new monthly phone bill is:\n\n\\[ 50 + 5 = 55 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Multiply the new monthly phone bill by 12 to find the total annual bill.**\n\nThe new monthly phone bill is $55. To find the total annual bill, we multiply $55 by 12:\n\n\\[ 55 \\times 12 = 660 \\]\n\nTherefore, Gillian's phone bill for the entire next year will be:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{660} \\]",

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the increased monthly bill by 12:\n\n\\[ 55 \\times 12 = 660 \\]\n\nTherefore, Gillian's phone bill for the entire next year will be:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{660} \\]",
