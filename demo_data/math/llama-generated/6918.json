        "To determine how many candies Bob bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many candies Emily bought.\n2. Use the information given about Jennifer's candies to find out how many candies Jennifer bought.\n3. Use the information given about Jennifer's candies to find out how many candies Bob bought.\n\nFirst, we know that Emily bought 6 candies. According to the problem, Jennifer bought twice as many candies as Emily. Therefore, we can calculate the number of candies Jennifer bought as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of candies Jennifer bought} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of candies Emily bought} = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Jennifer bought three times as many candies as Bob. Therefore, we can calculate the number of candies Bob bought as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of candies Bob bought} = \\frac{\\text{Number of candies Jennifer bought}}{3} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of candies Bob bought is \\boxed{4}.",

Therefore, we can calculate the number of candies Bob bought by dividing the number of candies Jennifer bought by 3:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of candies Bob bought} = \\frac{\\text{Number of candies Jennifer bought}}{3} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of candies Bob bought is \\boxed{4}.",
        "To determine how many candies Bob bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many candies Jennifer bought.\n2. Use the information about Jennifer's candies to find out how many candies Bob bought.\n\nFirst, we know that Emily bought 6 candies. According to the problem, Jennifer bought twice as many candies as Emily. Therefore, we calculate the number of candies Jennifer bought as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of candies Jennifer bought} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of candies Emily bought} = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, the problem states that Jennifer bought three times as many candies as Bob. Therefore, we can find the number of candies Bob bought by dividing the number of candies Jennifer bought by 3:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of candies Bob bought} = \\frac{\\text{Number of candies Jennifer bought}}{3} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of candies Bob bought is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
