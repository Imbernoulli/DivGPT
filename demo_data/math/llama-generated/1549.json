        "To determine the total number of chairs in Susan's house, we need to find out how many red, yellow, and blue chairs there are and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **Red Chairs**: We are given that there are 5 red chairs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red chairs} = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Yellow Chairs**: We are told that there are 4 times as many yellow chairs as red chairs. Since there are 5 red chairs, we calculate the number of yellow chairs as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of yellow chairs} = 4 \\times 5 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Blue Chairs**: We are told that there are 2 fewer blue chairs than yellow chairs. Since there are 20 yellow chairs, we calculate the number of blue chairs as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of blue chairs} = 20 - 2 = 18\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Number of Chairs**: To find the total number of chairs, we add the number of red chairs, yellow chairs, and blue chairs together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of chairs} = 5 + 20 + 18 = 43\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of chairs in Susan's house is \\(\\boxed{43}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of chairs in Susan's house, we need to calculate the number of each type of chair and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 5 red chairs.\n\\[ \\text{Number of red chairs} = 5 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that there are 4 times as many yellow chairs as red chairs. Therefore, we multiply the number of red chairs by 4:\n\\[ \\text{Number of yellow chairs} = 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\]\n\nThen, we areas that there are 2 fewer blue chairs than yellow chairs. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of yellow chairs:\n\\[ \\text{Number of blue chairs} = 20 - 2 = 18 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of red chairs, yellow chairs, and blue chairs to find the total number of chairs in Susan's house:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of chairs} = 5 + 20 + 18 = 43 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of chairs in Susan's house is \\(\\boxed{43}\\).",
