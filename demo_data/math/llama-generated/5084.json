        "To find the total number of necklaces made by both machines on Sunday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how many necklaces the second machine made.\n2. Add the number of necklaces made by the first machine to the number of necklaces made by the second machine.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of necklaces made by the second machine. The second machine made 2.4 times as many necklaces as the first machine. Since the first machine made 45 necklaces, we multiply 45 by 2.4:\n\n\\[ 45 \\times 2.4 = 108 \\]\n\nSo, the second machine made 108 necklaces.\n\nNext, we add the number of necklaces made by the first machine to the number of necklaces made by the second machine:\n\n\\[ 45 + 108 = 153 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of necklaces made on Sunday is \\(\\boxed{153}\\).",

Therefore, we multiply the number of necklaces made by the first machine by 2.4:\n\\[ 45 \\times 2.4 \\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication, we can break it down:\n\\[ 45 \\times 2.4 = 45 \\times \\left(2 + 0.4\\right) = (45 \\times 2) + (45 \\times 0.4) \\]\n\\[ 45 \\times 2 = 90 \\]\n\\[ 45 \\times 0.4 = 18 \\]\n\\[ 90 + 18 = 108 \\]\n\nSo, the second machine made 108 necklaces.\n\nNow, we add the number of necklaces made by both machines together:\n\\[ 45 + 108 = 153 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of necklaces made on Sunday is \\(\\boxed{153}\\).",
