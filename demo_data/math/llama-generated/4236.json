To find the discount amount, we multiply $30 by 5% (or 0.05):\n   \\[\n   30 \\times 0.05 = 1.50\n   \\]\n3. Subtract the discount amount from Bob's original bill:\n   \\[\n   30 - 1.50 = 28.50\n   \\]\n   So, Bob has to pay $28.50.\n\nNext, let's calculate for Kate:\n\n1. Kate's original bill is $25.\n2. Kate's discount is 2%. To find the discount amount, we multiply $25 by 2% (or 0.02):\n   \\[\n   25 \\times 0.02 = 0.50\n   \\]\n3. Subtract the discount amount from Kate's original bill:\n   \\[\n   25 - 0.50 = 24.50\n   \\]\n   So, Kate has to pay $24.50.\n\nFinally, we add Bob's final amount and Kate's final amount to get the total amount they have to pay:\n\\[\n28.50 + 24.50 = 53\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Bob and Kate have to pay is \\(\\boxed{53}\\).",

The discount amount is:\n\\[ 30 \\times \\frac{5}{100} = 30 \\times 0.05 = 1.5 \\]\nSo, the amount Bob has to pay after the discount is:\n\\[ 30 - 1.5 = 28.5 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the discount for Kate's bill:\nKate's original bill is $25, and she gets a 2% discount.
