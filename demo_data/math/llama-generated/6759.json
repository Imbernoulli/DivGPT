        "To determine how many dark blue marbles Fred has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of green marbles.\n2. Add the number of red marbles and green marbles to find the total number of red and green marbles.\n3. Subtract the total number of red and green marbles from the total number of marbles to find the number of dark blue marbles.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Fred has 38 red marbles and half as many green marbles. Therefore, the number of green marbles is:\n\\[\n\\frac{38}{2} = 19\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the number of red marbles and green marbles to find the total number of red and green marbles:\n\\[\n38 + 19 = 57\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of red and green marbles from the total number of marbles to find the number of dark blue marbles:\n\\[\n63 - 57 = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of dark blue marbles is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
