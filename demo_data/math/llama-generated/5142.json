        "To determine how long Erica can stay on the merry-go-round, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how long Chuck can stay on the merry-go-round.\n2. Use the information about how long Erica can stay on the merry-go-round compared to Chuck to find Erica's time.\n\nFirst, we know that Dave can ride the merry-go-round for 10 minutes. Since Chuck can ride it 5 times longer than Dave, we calculate Chuck's time as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Chuck's time} = 5 \\times \\text{Dave's time} = 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Erica can stay on the merry-go-round 30% longer than Chuck. To find out how much longer that is, we calculate 30% of Chuck's time:\n\\[\n\\text{Additional time for Erica} = 0.30 \\times \\text{Chuck's time} = 0.30 \\times 50 = 15 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Erica's total time on the merry-go-round is the sum of Chuck's time and the additional time:\n\\[\n\\text{Erica's time} = \\text{Chuck's time} + \\text{Additional time} = 50 + 15 = 65 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nSo, the flavors Erica can stay on the merry-go-round is \\boxed{65} minutes.",
