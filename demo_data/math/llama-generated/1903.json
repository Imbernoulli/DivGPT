During practice, linemen get the first water break and will drink 8 ounces each.  Skill position players get the second water break and drink 6 ounces each.  The team has 12 linemen and 10 skill position players.  If the cooler holds 126 ounces of water, how many skill position players must wait for the cooler to be refilled before they can get a drink?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many skill position players must wait for the cooler to be refilled, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of water consumed by the linemen.\n2. Subtract the water consumed by the linemen from the total amount of water in the cooler to find out how much water is left.\n3. Determine how many skill position players can get a drink with the remaining water.\n4. Calculate how many skill position players must wait for the cooler to be refilled.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water consumed by the linemen.**\n\nThe team has 12 linemen, and each linear drinks 8 ounces of water. Therefore, the total amount of water consumed by the linemen is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 8 = 96 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Subtract the water consumed by the linemen from the total amount of water in the cooler to find out how much water is left.**\n\nThe cooler holds 126 ounces of water. After the linemen have their water break, the amount of water left is:\n\\[ 126 - 96 = 30 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many skill position players can get a drink with the remaining water.**\n\nEach skill position player drinks 6 ounces of water. Therefore, the number of skill position players who can get a drink with the remaining 30 ounces of water is:\n\\[ \\frac{30}{6} = 5 \\text{ players} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate how many skill position players must wait for the cooler to be refilled.**\n\nThe team has 10 skill position players, and only 5 can get a drink with the remaining water. Therefore, the number of skill position players who must wait for the cooler to be refilled is:\n\\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \\]\n\nThe number of skill position players who must wait for the cooler to be refilled is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
        "To determine how many skill position players must wait for the cooler to be refilled, we need to calculate the total amount of water consumed by the linemen and then see how much water is left for the skill position players.\n\nFirst, calculate the total amount of water consumed by the linemen:\n\\[\n\\text{Water consumed by linemen} = \\text{Number of linemen} \\times \\text{Water per lineman}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Water consumed by linemen} = 12 \\times 8 = 96 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nNext, subtract the amount of water consumed by the linemen from the total capacity of the cooler to find out how much water is left:\n\\[\n\\text{Water left} = \\text{Total water capacity} - \\text{Water consumed by linemen}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Water left} = 126 - 96 = 30 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate how many skill position players can get a drink with the remaining water:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of skill position players who can get a drink} = \\frac{\\text{Water left}}{\\text{Water per skill position player}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Number of skill position players who can get a drink} = \\frac{30}{6} = 5\n\\]\n\nFinally, determine how many skill position players must wait for the cooler to be refilled by subtracting the number of skill position players who can get a drink from the total number of skill position players:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of skill position players who must wait} = \\text{Total number of skill position players} - \\text{Number of skill position players who can get a drink}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Number of skill position players who must wait} = 10 - 5 = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of skill position players who must wait for the cooler to be refilled is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

Subtract the water consumed by the linemen from the total amount of water in the cooler to find out how much water is left after the linemen have their drink.\n3. Determine how many skill position players can drink with the remaining water.\n4. Calculate how many skill position players must wait for the cooler to be refilled.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water consumed by the linemen.**\n\nThe team has 12 linemen, and each linear drinks 8 ounces of water. Therefore, the total amount of water consumed by the linemen is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 8 = 96 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Subtract the water consumed by the linemen from the total amount of water in the cooler.**\n\nThe cooler holds 126 ounces of water. After the linemen have their drink, the amount of water left is:\n\\[ 126 - 96 = 30 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many skill position players can drink with the remaining water.**\n\nEach skill position player drinks 6 ounces of water. Therefore, the number of skill position players who can drink with the remaining 30 ounces of water is:\n\\[ \\frac{30}{6} = 5 \\text{ players} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate how many skill position players must wait for the cooler to be refilled.**\n\nThe team has 10 skill position players, and only 5 can drink with the remaining water. Therefore, the number of skill position players who must wait for the cooler to be refilled is:\n\\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \\]\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
