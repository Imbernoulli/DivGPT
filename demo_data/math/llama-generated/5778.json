        "To determine how many more miles Carol will be able to drive after she gets home without filling her tank again, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance Carol can drive on a full tank of gas.\n2. Subtract the distance to her college from the total distance she can drive on a full tank.\n3. Determine how many more miles she can drive after she gets home.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Carol can drive on a full tank of gas. Since her car gets 20 miles to the gallon and her gas tank holds 16 gallons, the total distance is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ miles/gallon} \\times 16 \\text{ gallons} = 320 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the distance to her college from the total distance she can drive on a full tank. The distance to her college is 220 miles, so:\n\\[\n320 \\text{ miles} - 220 \\text{ miles} = 100 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, after Carol gets home, she will be able to drive \\boxed{100} more miles without filling her tank again.",

So, after she drives to her college, the remaining distance she can drive without refilling her tank is:\n\\[ 320 \\text{ miles} - 220 \\text{ miles} = 100 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many more miles she can drive after she gets home.**\n\nAfter she gets home, she will have driven a total of 220 miles. Since she can drive 100 miles more after getting home without refilling her tank, the number of miles she can drive after she gets home is:\n\\[ \\boxed{100} \\]",
