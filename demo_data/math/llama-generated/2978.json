The total cost of the drinks:\n   Mary bought 5 boxes of drinks at $6 each.\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 6 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the drinks is $30.\n\n2. The total cost of the pizzas:\n   Mary bought 10 boxes of pizzas at $14 each.\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 14 = 140\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the pizzas is $140.\n\n3. The total amount spent:\n   Add the total cost of the drinks and the total cost of the pizzas.\n   \\[\n   30 + 140 = 170\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount spent is $170.\n\n4. The change Mary get back:\n   Subtract the total amount spent from the amount Mary paid.\n   \\[\n   200 - 170 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, the change Mary get back is $30.\n\nTherefore, the change Mary get back is \\boxed{30}.",
        "To determine how much change Mary got back, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the drinks.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the pizzas.\n3.
