        "To determine how far John can now run, we need to calculate both his increased running time and his increased running speed, and then use these values to find the distance.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the increased running time. John starts with a running time of 8 hours and increases it by 75%. To find the increase in time, we multiply 8 hours by 75% (or 0.75):\n\n\\[ 8 \\times 0.75 = 6 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nAdding this increase to the original running time gives:\n\n\\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the increased running speed. John starts with a running speed of 8 mph and increases it by 4 mph:\n\n\\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nNow, we can find the distance John can run by multiplying his increased running time by his increased running speed:\n\n\\[ 14 \\times 12 = 168 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance John can now run is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{168} \\]",
