        "To find the percentage of children who prefer corn in Carolyn's daycare, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of children in the daycare.\n2. Calculate the number of children who prefer corn.\n3. Use the formula for percentage to find the percentage of children who prefer corn.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of children in the daycare. We add the number of children who prefer each vegetable:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ (peas)} + 9 \\text{ (carrots)} + 5 \\text{ (corn)} = 20 \\text{ (total children)} \\]\n\nNext, we know that 5 children prefer corn. To find the percentage of children who prefer corn, we use the formula for percentage:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of children who prefer corn}}{\\text{Total number of children}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\nSubstituting the numbers we have:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{5}{20} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nNow, we simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{5}{20}\\):\n\\[ \\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nThen we multiply by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right) \\times 100 = 25 \\]\n\nSo, the percentage of children who prefer corn is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",

To find the percentage of children who prefer corn, we use the formula for percentage:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of children who prefer corn}}{\\text{Total number of children}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{5}{20} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.25 \\times 100 = 25\\% \\]\n\nSo, the percentage of the children who prefer corn is:\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]",
        "To find the percentage of children who prefer corn, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of children in the daycare.\n2. Calculate the number of children who prefer corn as a fraction of the total number of children.\n3. Convert this fraction to a percentage.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of children in the daycare. We do this by adding the number of children who prefer each vegetable:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ (peas)} + 9 \\text{ (carrots)} + 5 \\text{ (corn)} = 20 \\text{ children} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of children who prefer corn as a fraction of the total number of children. This is done by dividing the number of children who prefer corn by the total number of children:\n\\[ \\frac{5}{20} \\]\n\nTo convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\\[ \\frac{5}{20} \\times 100 = 25\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of children who prefer corn is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
