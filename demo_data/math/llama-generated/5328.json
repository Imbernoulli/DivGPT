        "To determine how many trees in the park are not pine trees, we start by calculating the number of pine trees. Given that 70% of the 350 trees are pine trees, we can find the number of pine trees by multiplying 350 by 70%.\n\nFirst, convert the percentage to a decimal:\n\\[ 70\\% = 0.70 \\]\n\nNext, multiply the total number of trees by this decimal:\n\\[ 350 \\times 0.70 = 245 \\]\n\nSo, there are 245 pine trees.
