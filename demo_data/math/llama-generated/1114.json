She is using 5 bell peppers to make her meal. She likes to have a variety of sizes so some will melt and some will be thick enough to eat whole. First she cuts each bell pepper into 20 large slices. Then she takes half those slices and cuts them into 3 smaller pieces each. How many slices and pieces of bell pepper total is Tamia going to add to her meal?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total number of slices and pieces of bell pepper Tamia is going to add to her meal, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of large slices from all the bell peppers.\n2. Determine how many of these large slices are cut into smaller pieces.\n3. Calculate the total number of smaller pieces from the large slices that are cut.\n4. Add the number of large slices that are not cut to the total number of smaller pieces.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Tamia has 5 bell peppers, and each bell pepper is cut into 20 large slices. Therefore, the total number of large slices is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 20 = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. Tamia takes half of these large slices and cuts them into smaller pieces. So, the number of large slices that are cut is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{100}{2} = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. Each of these 50 large slices is cut into 3 smaller pieces. Therefore, the total number of smaller pieces is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\times 3 = 150\n   \\]\n\n4. The number of large slices that are not cut is:\n   \\[\n   100 - 50 = 50\n   \\]\n\n5. To find the total number of slices and pieces of bell pepper, we add the number of large slices that are not cut to the total number of smaller pieces:\n   \\[\n   50 + 150 = 200\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of slices and pieces of bell pepper Tamia is going to add to her meal is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{200}\n\\]",
