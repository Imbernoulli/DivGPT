        "To determine how much Karsyn paid for the phone after negotiating, we need to calculate 20% of the initial price of the phone.\n\nThe initial price of the phone is $600. To find 20% of $600, we can use the following formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Discounted Price} = \\text{Initial Price} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{Discount Percentage}}{100}\\right)\n\\]\nHere, the discount percentage is 20. So, we substitute the values into the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Discounted Price} = 600 \\times \\left(\\frac{20}{100}\\right) = 600 \\times 0.20 = 120\n\\]\nThis means Karsyn paid a $120 discount on the initial price. To find out the final amount she paid, we subtract the discount from the initial price:\n\\[\n\\text{Final Price} = \\text{Initial Price} - \\text{Discount} = 600 - 120 = 480\n\\]\nTherefore, the amount Karsyn paid after negotiating is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{480}\n\\]",
        "To determine how much Karsyn paid for the phone after negotiating, we need to calculate 20% of the initial price of the phone. The initial price of the phone is $600.\n\nFirst, we find 20% of $600 by multiplying $600 by 20% (or 0.20 in decimal form):\n\\[\n600 \\times 0.20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThis means Karsyn paid $120 less than the initial price. To find the final price she paid, we subtract this amount from the initial price:\n\\[\n600 - 120 = 480\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Karsyn paid after negotiating is \\boxed{480}.",
