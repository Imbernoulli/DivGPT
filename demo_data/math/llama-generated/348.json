        "To find the total amount of cereal in all three boxes, we need to determine the amount of cereal in each box and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **First Box:**\n   The first box holds 14 ounces of cereal.\n\n2. **Second Box:**\n   The second box holds half the amount of the first box.

The problem states that the second box holds half the amount of the first box, so:\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{A}{2} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n3. Let's denote the amount of cereal in the third box as \\( C \\). The problem states that the second box holds 5 ounces less than the third box, so:\n   \\[\n   B = C - 5\n   \\]\n   Since we already know that \\( B = 7 \\) ounces, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n   \\[\n   7 = C - 5\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( C \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   C = 7 + 5 = 12 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the amounts of cereal in all three boxes:\n\\[\nA + B + C = 14 + 7 + 12 = 33\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of cereal in all three cereal boxes is \\(\\boxed{33}\\) ounces.",
        "To determine the total amount of cereal in all three boxes, we need to find out how much cereal each box contains and then sum these amounts.\n\n1.
