        "To determine the total number of quarters needed to buy three candy bars, two pieces of chocolate, and one pack of juice, we first need to calculate the cost of each item in quarters.\n\n1. Calculate the cost of three candy bars:\n   Each candy bar costs 25 cents, so three candy bars cost:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 25 = 75 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the cost of two pieces of chocolate:\n   Each piece of chocolate costs 75 cents, so two pieces of chocolate cost:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 75 = 150 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the cost of one pack of juice:\n   Each pack of juice costs 50 cents, so one pack of juice costs:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 50 = 50 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n4. Add the costs of the three candy bars, two pieces of chocolate, and one pack of juice to find the total cost:\n   \\[\n   75 + 150 + 50 = 275 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n5. Convert the total cost from cents to quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the number of quarters needed is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{275}{25} = 11\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of quarters needed to buy three candy bars, two pieces of chocolate, and one pack of juice is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
