        "To determine how many roses each person will get, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of roses Ricky has after his little sister steals some.\n2. Divide the remaining roses equally among the 9 people.\n\nFirst, we start with the initial number of roses Ricky has, which is 40. His little sister steals 4 roses, so we subtract 4 from 40:\n\\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \\]\nNow, Ricky has 36 roses left. He wants to give these roses equally to 9 different people. To find out how many roses each person will get, we divide 36 by 9:\n\\[ 36 \\div 9 = 4 \\]\nSo, each person will get 4 roses. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]",
