        "To determine how many more times Greg's bike wheels need to rotate to reach his goal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of wheel rotations required to ride 8 blocks.\n2. Subtract the number of wheel rotations already completed from the total required.\n\nFirst, we know that each block Greg rides, his wheels rotate 200 times. Therefore, to ride 8 blocks, the total number of wheel rotations needed is:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ blocks} \\times 200 \\text{ rotations/block} = 1600 \\text{ rotations}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Greg's wheels have already rotated 600 times. To find out how many more rotations are needed, we subtract the number of rotations already completed from the total required:\n\\[\n1600 \\text{ rotations} - 600 \\text{ rotations} = 1000 \\text{ rotations}\n\\]\n\nThus, Greg's wheels need to rotate \\(\\boxed{1000}\\) more times to reach his goal.",
