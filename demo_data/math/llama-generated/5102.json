        "To determine how much Selene pays in total after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the instant cameras.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the digital photo frames.\n3. Add the total costs of the instant cameras and the digital photo frames to get the subtotal.\n4. Calculate the discount on the subtotal.\n5. Subtract the discount from the subtotal to get the final amount paid.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the instant cameras:**\n   Selene buys two instant cameras at $110 each.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 110 = 220\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the instant cameras is $220.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the digital photo frames:**\n   Selene buys three digital photo frames at $120 each.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 120 = 360\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the digital photo frames is $360.\n\n3. **Add the total costs of the instant cameras and the digital photo frames to get the subtotal:**\n   \\[\n   220 + 360 = 580\n   \\]\n   So, the subtotal is $580.\n\n4. **Calculate the discount on the subtotal:**\n   Selene gets a 5% discount on all the items she purchased. To find the discount amount, we multiply the subtotal by 5% (which is the same as 0.05).\n   \\[\n   580 \\times 0.05 = 29\n   \\]\n   So, the discount amount is $29.\n\n5. **Subtract the discount from the subtotal to get the final amount paid:**\n   \\[\n   580 - 29 = 551\n   \\]\n   So, the final amount Selene pays is \\(\\boxed{551}\\).",

The total cost of the instant cameras:\n   Selene buys two instant cameras at $110 each.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 110 = 220\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the instant cameras is $220.\n\n2. The total cost of the digital photo frames:\n   Selene buys three digital photo frames at $120 each.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 120 = 360\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the digital photo frames is $360.\n\n3. The subtotal of all the items:\n   Add the total cost of the instant cameras and the total cost of the digital photo frames.\n   \\[\n   220 + 360 = 580\n   \\]\n   So, the subtotal is $580.\n\n4. The discount amount:\n   Selene gets a 5% discount on the total amount.\n   First, convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.\n   \\[\n   5\\% = 0.05\n   \\]\n   Then, multiply the subtotal by the decimal to find the discount amount.\n   \\[\n   580 \\times 0.05 = 29\n   \\]\n   So, the discount amount is $29.\n\n5. The final total:\n   Subtract the discount amount from the subtotal to get the final total.\n   \\[\n   580 - 29 = 551\n   \\]\n   So, the final total amount Selene pays is \\boxed{551}.",

Subtract the discount from the subtotal to find the final amount paid.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the instant cameras:**\n   Selene buys two instant cameras at $110 each.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 110 = 220\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the instant cameras is $220.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the digital photo frames:**\n   Selene buys three digital photo frames at $120 each.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 120 = 360\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the digital photo frames is $360.\n\n3. **Add the total costs of the instant cameras and the digital photo frames to find the subtotal:**\n   \\[\n   220 + 360 = 580\n   \\]\n   So, the subtotal is $580.\n\n4. **Calculate the discount on the subtotal:**\n   Selene gets a 5% discount on all the items she purchased. First, we need to find 5% of $580.\n   \\[\n   0.05 \\times 580 = 29\n   \\]\n   So, the discount is $29.\n\n5. **Subtract the discount from the subtotal to find the final amount paid:**\n   \\[\n   580 - 29 = 551\n   \\]\n   So, the final amount Selene pays is \\(\\boxed{551}\\).",
        "To determine how much Selene pays in total after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the instant cameras.\n2.

Subtract the discount from the subtotal to get the final amount paid.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. **Total cost of the instant cameras:**\n   Selene buys two instant cameras at $110 each.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 110 = 220\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total cost of the digital photo frames:**\n   Selene buys three digital photo frames at $120 each.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 120 = 360\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtotal:**\n   Add the total cost of the instant cameras and the total cost of the digital photo frames.\n   \\[\n   220 + 360 = 580\n   \\]\n\n4. **Discount:**\n   Selene gets a 5% discount on the subtotal. First, convert 5% to a decimal by dividing by 100.\n   \\[\n   5\\% = \\frac{5}{100} = 0.05\n   \\]\n   Then, calculate the discount by multiplying the subtotal by the decimal.\n   \\[\n   580 \\times 0.05 = 29\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final amount paid:**\n   Subtract the discount from the subtotal.\n   \\[\n   580 - 29 = 551\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Selene pays is \\(\\boxed{551}\\).",
