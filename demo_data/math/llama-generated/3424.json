        "To determine Patrick's current age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out Robert's current age.\n2. Determine Patrick's age based on the relationship between their ages.\n\nFirst, we know that Robert will turn 30 after 2 years. Therefore, we can calculate Robert's current age by subtracting 2 from 30:\n\\[ 30 - 2 = 28 \\]\nSo, Robert is currently 28 years old.\n\nNext, we know that Patrick is half the age of his elder brother Robert. Therefore, we can calculate Patrick's age by dividing Robert's current age by 2:\n\\[ 28 \\div 2 = 14 \\]\nSo, Patrick is currently 14 years old.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]",
