        "To determine the sale price of the NES, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the value Tom receives for trading in his super Nintendo (SNES).\n2. Determine the total amount Tom pays after receiving the trade-in value.\n3. Subtract the change and the value of the game Tom receives from the total amount paid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value Tom receives for trading in his SNES. The SNES is worth $150 and the store gives him 80% of that value:\n\\[\n150 \\times 0.80 = 120\n\\]\nSo, Tom receives $120 for his SNES.\n\nNext, let's determine the total amount Tom pays after receiving the trade-in value. Tom gives $80 and gets back $10 change. Therefore, the net amount he pays in cash is:\n\\[\n80 - 10 = 70\n\\]\nAdding the trade-in value to the net cash payment gives:\n\\[\n120 + 70 = 190\n\\]\nSo, Tom pays a total of $190.\n\nFinally, let's subtract the value of the game Tom receives from the total amount paid to find the sale price of the NES. The game is worth $30, so the sale price of the NES is:\n\\[\n190 - 30 = 160\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the NES was on sale for \\boxed{160} dollars.",

Adding the value he received from trading in the SNES, the total amount Tom spends is:\n\\[ 120 + 70 = 190 \\]\n\nSince Tom receives a game worth $30, the sale price of the NES is the total amount spent minus the value of the game:\n\\[ 190 - 30 = 160 \\]\n\nTherefore, the sale price of the NES is:\n\\[ \\boxed{160} \\]",

Determine the total amount Tom paid after receiving the trade-in value and getting change.\n3. Subtract the value of the game Tom received to find the sale price of the NES.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the value Tom received for trading in his SNES.**\n\nThe SNES is worth $150, and the store gives him 80% of that value. So, we calculate:\n\\[ 150 \\times 0.80 = 120 \\]\n\nTom received $120 for his SNES.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total amount Tom paid after receiving the trade-in value and getting change.**\n\nTom gave $80 and got back $10 change. So, the amount he paid in cash is:\n\\[ 80 - 10 = 70 \\]\n\nAdding the trade-in value to the cash he paid, the total amount he paid is:\n\\[ 120 + 70 = 190 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the value of the game Tom received to find the sale price of the NES.**\n\nTom received a game worth $30.

Therefore, the net amount he spends is:\n\\[\n80 - 10 = 70\n\\]\nSo, Tom spends $70 after receiving the value of the SNES and the change.\n\nFinally, we subtract the value of the game Tom receives from the total amount spent to find the sale price of the NES.
