        "To determine how long Carlo should practice on Friday, we need to calculate the total time he has already practiced from Monday to Thursday and then find out how much more time he needs to practice to reach a total of 5 hours.\n\nFirst, let's find out how long Carlo practiced on each day:\n\n1. **Thursday**: Carlo practiced for 50 minutes.\n2. **Wednesday**: Carlo practiced 5 minutes more than on Thursday. Therefore, he practiced \\(50 + 5 = 55\\) minutes.\n3. **Tuesday**: Carlo practiced 10 minutes less than on Wednesday. Therefore, he practiced \\(55 - 10 = 45\\) minutes.\n4. **Monday**: Carlo practiced twice as long on Monday as on Tuesday. Therefore, he practiced \\(45 \\times 2 = 90\\) minutes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time Carlo has practiced from Monday to Thursday:\n\\[90 + 45 + 55 + 50 = 240\\text{ minutes}\\]\n\nSince Carlo needs to practice for a total of 5 hours, we convert 5 hours into minutes:\n\\[5 \\text{ hours} = 5 \\times 60 = 300\\text{ minutes}\\]\n\nTo find out how long Carlo should practice on Friday, we subtract the total time he has already practiced from the total time he needs to practice:\n\\[300 - 240 = 60\\text{ minutes}\\]\n\nTherefore, Carlo should practice \\(\\boxed{60}\\) minutes on Friday.",
