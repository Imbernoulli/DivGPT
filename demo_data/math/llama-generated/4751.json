        "To determine how many shots Jordan blocked in the fourth period, we start by calculating the number of shots he blocked in each of the first three periods.\n\n1. **First period**: Jordan blocked 4 shots.\n2. **Second period**: Jordan blocked twice as many shots as in the first period. Therefore, he blocked \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) shots.\n3. **Third period**: Jordan blocked three fewer shots than in the second period. Therefore, he blocked \\(8 - 3 = 5\\) shots.\n\nNext, we sum the number of shots blocked in the first three periods:\n\\[4 + 8 + 5 = 17\\]\n\nWe know that by the end of the game, Jordan had blocked a total of 21 shots. Therefore, the number of shots he blocked in the fourth period is:\n\\[21 - 17 = 4\\]\n\nThus, the number of shots Jordan blocked in the fourth period is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
        "To determine how many shots Jordan blocked in the fourth period, we need to calculate the number of shots he blocked in each period and then use the total to find the fourth period's total.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of shots Jordan blocked in each period:\n- In the first period, Jordan blocked 4 shots.\n- In the second period, he blocked twice as many shots as in the first period. Therefore, he blocked \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) shots.\n- In the third period, he blocked three fewer shots than in the second period. Therefore, he blocked \\(8 - 3 = 5\\) shots.\n- Let the number of shots Jordan blocked in the fourth period be \\(x\\).\n\nWe know the total number of shots blocked by Jordan in all four periods is 21. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[4 + 8 + 5 + x = 21\\]\n\nNext, we combine the known values on the left side of the equation:\n\\[17 + x = 21\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[x = 21 - 17\\]\n\\[x = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, Jordan blocked \\(\\boxed{4}\\) shots in the fourth period."
