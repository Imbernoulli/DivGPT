        "To determine Lanie's salary for the week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of hours Lanie worked.\n2. Multiply the number of hours worked by her hourly rate.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many hours Lanie worked. She worked \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) of her usual 40-hour week.

Multiply the number of hours worked by her hourly rate.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of hours Lanie worked. Since she worked 4/5 of her usual 40-hour week, we perform the following multiplication:\n\\[\n\\text{Hours worked} = \\frac{4}{5} \\times 40\n\\]\nTo multiply the fraction by the whole number, we can rewrite 40 as a fraction with a denominator of 1:\n\\[\n\\text{Hours worked} = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{40}{1} = \\frac{4 \\times 40}{5 \\times 1} = \\frac{160}{5} = 32\n\\]\nSo, Lanie worked 32 hours.\n\nNext, we calculate her salary by multiplying the number of hours worked by her hourly rate.

So, we multiply 40 by \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\):\n\n\\[\n40 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 40 \\times 0.8 = 32 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much she earned for working 32 hours. Her hourly rate is $15, so we multiply 32 by 15:\n\n\\[\n32 \\times 15 = 480\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Lanie's salary for that week is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",
