        "To determine the total number of turtles Marion and Martha received together, we start by identifying the number of turtles each person received.\n\nFirst, we know that Martha received 40 turtles. According to the problem, Marion received 20 more turtles than Martha. Therefore, we can calculate the number of turtles Marion received as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of turtles Marion received} = \\text{Number of turtles Martha received} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of turtles received by both Marion and Martha by adding the number of turtles each received:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of turtles} = \\text{Number of turtles Martha received} + \\text{Number of turtles Marion received} = 40 + 60 = 100\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of turtles they received together is \\boxed{100}.",
