        "To determine the cost to feed the chickens, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of ducks.\n2. Determine the number of chickens.\n3. Calculate the cost to feed the chickens.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ducks.**\n\nPeter has 15 birds, and 1/3 of them are ducks. Therefore, the number of ducks is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 15 = 5\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of chickens.**\n\nSince the total number of birds is 15 and 5 of them are ducks, the number of chickens is:\n\\[\n15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the cost to feed the chickens.**\n\nThe cost to feed each chicken is $2. Therefore, the total cost to feed 10 chickens is:\n\\[\n10 \\times 2 = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost to feed the chickens is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
