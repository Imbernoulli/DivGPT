There are 365 days in a year, so the total production for the first year is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ televisions/day} \\times 365 \\text{ days} = 3650 \\text{ televisions} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Reduce the first year's total production by 10 percent to find the second year's total production.**\n\nA 10 percent reduction means that the factory produced 90 percent of the televisions it produced in the first year. Therefore, the total production for the second year is:\n\\[ 3650 \\text{ televisions} \\times 0.90 = 3285 \\text{ televisions} \\]\n\nSo, the total production of televisions by the factory in the second year is \\(\\boxed{3285}\\).",
