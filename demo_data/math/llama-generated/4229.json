        "To determine how many cents Winston has left after spending half a dollar on candy, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number of quarters to cents:**\n   Winston has 14 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:\n   \\[\n   14 \\text{ quarters} \\times 25 \\text{ cents per quarter} = 350 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert half a dollar to cents:**\n   Half a dollar is equal to 50 cents.\n\n3. **Subtract the amount spent from the total amount:**\n   Winston spends 50 cents on candy. We subtract this amount from the total amount of cents he initially had:\n   \\[\n   350 \\text{ cents} - 50 \\text{ cents} = 300 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cents Winston has left is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
        "To determine how many cents Winston has left after spending half a dollar on candy, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total value of the quarters Winston has.\n2. Determine the cost of the candy in cents.\n3. Subtract the cost of the candy from the total value of the quarters.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total value of the quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, and Winston has 14 quarters, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:\n\\[ 14 \\times 25 = 350 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the cost of the candy. The problem states that Winston spends half a dollar on candy. Since one dollar is equal to 100 cents, half a dollar is:\n\\[ \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the cost of the candy from the total value of the quarters:\n\\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cents Winston has left is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
