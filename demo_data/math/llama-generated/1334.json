        "To determine how much more money Gretel will make compared to Hansel after their respective raises, we need to calculate their new annual salaries and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Hansel's new salary after a 10% raise. Hansel's original salary is $30,000. A 10% raise means he gets an additional 10% of $30,000. We can calculate the raise as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Hansel's raise} = 0.10 \\times 30,000 = 3,000 \\]\nAdding this raise to his original salary gives:\n\\[ \\text{Hansel's new salary} = 30,000 + 3,000 = 33,000 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate Gretel's new salary after a 15% raise. Gretel's original salary is also $30,000. A 15% raise means she gets an additional 15% of $30,000. We can calculate the raise as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Gretel's raise} = 0.15 \\times 30,000 = 4,500 \\]\nAdding this raise to her original salary gives:\n\\[ \\text{Gretel's new salary} = 30,000 + 4,500 = 34,500 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between Gretel's new salary and Hansel's new salary:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 34,500 - 33,000 = 1,500 \\]\n\nTherefore, Gretel will make \\(\\boxed{1500}\\) dollars more than Hansel.",
