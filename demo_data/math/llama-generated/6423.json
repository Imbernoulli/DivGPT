The original number of doughnuts was 50, so the number of doughnuts left is:\n\\[ 50 - 38 = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of doughnuts left is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
        "To determine how many doughnuts are left after the staff meeting, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts consumed by the staff.\n2.
