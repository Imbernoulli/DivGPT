        "To determine how many grilled cheese sandwiches Joan makes, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.\n\nLet \\( h \\) be the number of ham sandwiches and \\( g \\) be the number of grilled cheese sandwiches. According to the problem, Joan makes 10 ham sandwiches, so \\( h = 10 \\).\n\nEach ham sandwich requires 2 slices of cheese, and each grilled cheese sandwich requires 3 slices of cheese. The total number of slices of cheese used is 50. Therefore, we can write the following equation to represent the total cheese used:\n\n\\[ 2h + 3g = 50 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( h = 10 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 2(10) + 3g = 50 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 20 + 3g = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( g \\) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 3g = 30 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( g \\) by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ g = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Joan makes \\(\\boxed{10}\\) grilled cheese sandwiches.",
