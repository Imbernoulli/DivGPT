Every week, he has to refill the emptied feeder. Each cup of birdseed can feed fourteen birds, but Ivan is constantly chasing away a hungry squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed from the feeder every week.

        "To determine how many birds Ivan's bird feeder feeds weekly, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of birdseed left in the feeder after the squirrel steals some.\n2. Determine how many birds can be fed with the remaining birdseed.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much birdseed is left in the feeder after the squirrel steals half a cup. The feeder initially holds 2 cups of birdseed, and the squirrel steals 0.5 cups each week. Therefore, the amount of birdseed left is:\n\\[ 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many birds can be fed with the remaining 1.5 cups of birdseed. We know that each cup of birdseed can feed 14 birds. So, the number of birds that can be fed with 1.5 cups of birdseed is:\n\\[ 1.5 \\times 14 = 21 \\text{ birds} \\]\n\nThus, the number of birds that Ivan's bird feeder feeds weekly is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",

Since each cup of birdseed can feed 14 birds, the number of birds that can be fed with 1.5 cups of birdseed is:\n\\[ 1.5 \\times 14 = 21 \\text{ birds} \\]\n\nThus, the number of birds that Ivan's bird feeder feeds weekly is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
        "To determine how many birds Ivan's bird feeder feeds weekly, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of birdseed left in the feeder after the squirrel steals some.\n2. Determine how many birds can be fed with the remaining birdseed.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much birdseed is left in the feeder after the squirrel steals half a cup. The feeder initially holds 2 cups of birdseed, and the squirrel steals half a cup each week. Therefore, the amount of birdseed left is:\n\\[ 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many birds can be fed with the remaining 1.5 cups of birdseed. Each cup of birdseed can feed 14 birds. So, the number of birds that can be fed with 1.5 cups of birdseed is:\n\\[ 1.5 \\times 14 = 21 \\text{ birds} \\]\n\nThus, the number of birds Ivan's bird feeder feeds weekly is:\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]",
