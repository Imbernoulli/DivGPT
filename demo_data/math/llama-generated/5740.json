        "To determine how much older Andy is than Rahim right now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Rahim's current age.\n2. Determine Andy's age in 5 years.\n3. Use the information given to find Andy's current age.\n4. Calculate the difference between Andy's and Rahim's current ages.\n\nLet's start with the information given:\n- Rahim is currently 6 years old.\n- In 5 years, Andy will be twice as old as Rahim is now.\n\nFirst, we calculate twice Rahim's current age:\n\\[ 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\]\nThis means that in 5 years, Andy will be 12 years old. Let's denote Andy's current age as \\( A \\). Therefore, in 5 years, Andy's age will be \\( A + 5 \\). According to the problem, this age is equal to 12:\n\\[ A + 5 = 12 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( A \\) by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ A = 12 - 5 \\]\n\\[ A = 7 \\]\nSo, Andy is currently 7 years old.\n\nNow, we find the difference between Andy's current age and Rahim's current age:\n\\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) year older than Rahim right now.",
        "To determine how much older Andy is than Rahim right now, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.\n\nLet's denote Andy's current age by \\( A \\) and Rahim's current age by \\( R \\). According to the problem, Rahim is currently 6 years old, so we have:\n\\[ R = 6 \\]\n\nIn 5 years, Andy's age will be \\( A + 5 \\). The problem states that in 5 years, Andy will be twice as old as Rahim is now. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ A + 5 = 2R \\]\n\nSince we know that \\( R = 6 \\), we substitute 6 for \\( R \\) in the equation:\n\\[ A + 5 = 2 \\times 6 \\]\n\\[ A + 5 = 12 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( A \\) by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ A = 12 - 5 \\]\n\\[ A = 7 \\]\n\nSo, Andy is currently 7 years old. To find out how much older Andy is than Rahim right now, we subtract Rahim's current age from Andy's current age:\n\\[ A - R = 7 - 6 = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) year older than Rahim right now.",

We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\n\\[ A + 5 = 2R \\]\n\nSince we know that \\( R = 6 \\), we substitute 6 for \\( R \\) in the equation:\n\n\\[ A + 5 = 2 \\times 6 \\]\n\\[ A + 5 = 12 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( A \\) by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ A = 12 - 5 \\]\n\\[ A = 7 \\]\n\nNow that we know Andy's current age is 7, we can find out how much older Andy is than Rahim by subtracting Rahim's current age from Andy's current age:\n\n\\[ A - R = 7 - 6 = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) year older than Rahim right now.",
