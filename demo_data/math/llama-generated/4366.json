        "First, let's determine how many cakes Gary can make. Since each cake requires 0.5 pounds of flour and Gary is using 4 pounds of flour for cakes, we calculate the number of cakes as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cakes} = \\frac{4 \\text{ pounds}}{0.5 \\text{ pounds per cake}} = 8 \\text{ cakes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue from selling the cakes. Since each cake is sold for $2.5, the total revenue from the cakes is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from cakes} = 8 \\text{ cakes} \\times 2.5 \\text{ dollars per cake} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine how many cupcakes Gary can make. Since each cupcake requires \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) pounds of flour and Gary is using 2 pounds of flour for cupcakes, we calculate the number of cupcakes as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cupcakes} = \\frac{2 \\text{ pounds}}{\\frac{1}{5} \\text{ pounds per cupcake}} = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ cupcakes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total revenue from selling the cupcakes. Since each cupcake is sold for $1, the total revenue from the cupcakes is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue from cupcakes} = 10 \\text{ cupcakes} \\times 1 \\text{ dollar per cupcake} = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the revenue from the cakes and the revenue from the cupcakes to find the total amount Gary will earn:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings} = 20 \\text{ dollars} + 10 \\text{ dollars} = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, Gary will earn \\(\\boxed{30}\\) dollars.",
