        "To determine the difference in pay between Oula and Tona for the month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of deliveries Tona made in the month.\n2. Determine Oula's total pay for the month.\n3. Determine Tona's total pay for the month.\n4. Find the difference between Oula's and Tona's total pay.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of deliveries Tona made. Tona made \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) times as many deliveries as Oula. Since Oula made 96 deliveries, we can find the number of deliveries Tona made by multiplying 96 by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\n96 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 96 \\times 0.75 = 72\n\\]\n\nSo, Tona made 72 deliveries.\n\nNext, let's determine Oula's total pay for the month. Oula is paid $100 for each delivery, and she made 96 deliveries. Therefore, her total pay is:\n\n\\[\n96 \\times 100 = 9600\n\\]\n\nSo, Oula's total pay is $9600.\n\nNow, let's determine Tona's total pay for the month. Tona is paid $100 for each delivery, and she made 72 deliveries. Therefore, her total pay is:\n\n\\[\n72 \\times 100 = 7200\n\\]\n\nSo, Tona's total pay is $7200.\n\nFinally, let's find the difference between Oula's and Tona's total pay. We subtract Tona's total pay from Oula's total pay:\n\n\\[\n9600 - 7200 = 2400\n\\]\n\nSo, the difference in pay that month is \\(\\boxed{2400}\\).",

Since Tona made \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) times as many deliveries as Oula, we can multiply the number of deliveries Oula made by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Tona's deliveries} = 96 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 96 \\times 0.75 = 72\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate Oula's total pay for the month. Since Oula made 96 deliveries and each delivery pays $100, we multiply the number of deliveries by the pay per delivery:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Oula's pay} = 96 \\times 100 = 9600\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate Tona's total pay for the month. Since Tona made 72 deliveries and each delivery pays $100, we multiply the number of deliveries by the pay per delivery:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Tona's pay} = 72 \\times 100 = 7200\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between Oula's and Tona's total pay:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in pay} = 9600 - 7200 = 2400\n\\]\n\nThus, the difference in pay that month is \\(\\boxed{2400}\\)."
