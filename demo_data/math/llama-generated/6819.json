        "To determine the total sum of money that Parker and Richie shared, we start by understanding the ratio in which they split the money. The ratio is 2:3, meaning that for every 2 parts that Parker receives, Richie receives 3 parts.\n\nLet's denote the value of one part as \\( x \\). According to the ratio, Parker's share is \\( 2x \\) and Richie's share is \\( 3x \\). We know from the problem that Parker's share is $50. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 2x = 50 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ x = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\]\n\nNow that we know the value of one part is $25, we can find Richie's share by calculating \\( 3x \\):\n\\[ 3x = 3 \\times 25 = 75 \\]\n\nThe total sum of money that Parker and Richie shared is the sum of their individual shares:\n\\[ 2x + 3x = 5x = 5 \\times 25 = 125 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total sum of money they shared is \\(\\boxed{125}\\).",
