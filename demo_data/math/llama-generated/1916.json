        "To determine Louis's current age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Carla's current age.\n2. Use the information about the sum of their current ages to find Louis's age.\n\nFirst, we know that in 6 years, Carla will be 30 years old. Therefore, we can calculate Carla's current age by subtracting 6 from 30:\n\\[\n30 - 6 = 24\n\\]\nSo, Carla is currently 24 years old.\n\nNext, we know that the sum of Carla's and Louis's current ages is 55. Let's denote Louis's current age as \\( L \\). We can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n24 + L = 55\n\\]\nTo find \\( L \\), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nL = 55 - 24\n\\]\n\\[\nL = 31\n\\]\nTherefore, Louis is currently \\(\\boxed{31}\\) years old.",

Therefore, Carla's current age is:\n\\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, we know that the sum of the current ages of Carla and Louis is 55. Let \\( L \\) represent Louis's current age.
