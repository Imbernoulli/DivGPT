        "To determine how much the art piece will have increased in value, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the initial cost of the art piece three years ago.\n2. Calculate the future value of the art piece three years from now.\n3. Determine the increase in value from the initial cost to the future value.\n\nFirst, we know that three years ago, Rosie purchased the art piece for $4000. According to the problem, in another three years, the value of the art piece will be three times its initial value. Therefore, we calculate the future value as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Future value} = 3 \\times \\text{Initial value} = 3 \\times 4000 = 12000 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much the art piece will have increased in value. This is the difference between the future value and the initial value:\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase in value} = \\text{Future value} - \\text{Initial value} = 12000 - 4000 = 8000 \\]\n\nThus, the art piece will have increased by \\(\\boxed{8000}\\) dollars.",

Calculate the future value of the art piece after another three years.\n3. Determine the increase in value by subtracting the initial purchase price from the future value.\n\nFirst, we know that Rosie purchased the art piece for $4000 three years ago. According to the problem, the value of the art piece will be three times its current value in another three years. Therefore, we need to calculate the value of the art piece six years after the initial purchase.\n\nThe current value of the art piece is $4000. In another three years, the value will be three times the current value:\n\\[\n3 \\times 4000 = 12000\n\\]\n\nSo, the value of the art piece six years after the initial purchase is $12000. To find out how much the art piece has increased in value, we subtract the initial purchase price from the future value:\n\\[\n12000 - 4000 = 8000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the art piece will have increased by \\boxed{8000} dollars.",

Determine the value of the art piece six years from now.\n3. Find the difference between the value of the art piece six years from now and its current value.\n\nFirst, we know that three years ago, Rosie purchased the art piece for $4000. The value of the art piece will be three times its current value in another three years. Therefore, we need to find out what its value will be six years from now.\n\nSince three years ago the art piece was $4000, its current value is $4000. In another three years, the value will be three times its current value. So, we calculate:\n\\[ 3 \\times 4000 = 12000 \\]\n\nThis means that six years from now, the art piece will be worth $12000.
