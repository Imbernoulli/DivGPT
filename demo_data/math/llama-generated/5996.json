        "To determine how many boxes of cookies Sonny has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the total number of boxes Sonny received.\n2. Subtract the number of boxes he gave to his brother.\n3. Subtract the number of boxes he gave to his sister.\n4. Subtract the number of boxes he gave to his cousin.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Sonny received a total of 45 boxes of cookies.\n2. He gave 12 boxes to his brother. So, we subtract 12 from 45:\n   \\[\n   45 - 12 = 33\n   \\]\n   Now, Sonny has 33 boxes left.\n3. He gave 9 boxes to his sister. So, we subtract 9 from 33:\n   \\[\n   33 - 9 = 24\n   \\]\n   Now, Sonny has 24 boxes left.\n4. He gave 7 boxes to his cousin. So, we subtract 7 from 24:\n   \\[\n   24 - 7 = 17\n   \\]\n   Now, Sonny has 17 boxes left.\n\nTherefore, the number of boxes of cookies left for Sonny is \\boxed{17}.",
