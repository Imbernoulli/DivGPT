        "Let's define the number of videos watched by Uma as \\( U \\). According to the problem, Ekon watched 17 less than Uma, so we can express the number of videos watched by Ekon as \\( U - 17 \\). Additionally, Kelsey watched 43 more than Ekon, so the number of videos watched by Kelsey can be expressed as \\( (U - 17) + 43 = U + 26 \\).\n\nThe total number of videos watched by all three friends is 411. Therefore, we can write the following equation to represent the total number of videos:\n\\[ U + (U - 17) + (U + 26) = 411 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ U + U - 17 + U + 26 = 411 \\]\n\\[ 3U + 9 = 411 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( U \\), we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3U = 402 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ U = 134 \\]\n\nNow that we know Uma watched 134 videos, we can find out how many videos Ekon watched by subtracting 17 from Uma's total:\n\\[ Ekon = U - 17 = 134 - 17 = 117 \\]\n\nFinally, we can find out how many videos Kelsey watched by adding 26 to Ekon's total:\n\\[ Kelsey = U + 26 = 134 + 26 = 160 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of videos Kelsey watched is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",

According to the problem, Ekon watched 17 less than Uma, so we can express the number of videos watched by Ekon as \\( U - 17 \\). Kelsey watched 43 more than Ekon, so we can express the number of videos watched by Kelsey as \\( (U - 17) + 43 \\), which simplifies to \\( U + 26 \\).\n\nThe total number of videos watched by all three friends is 411. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ U + (U - 17) + (U + 26) = 411 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ U + U - 17 + U + 26 = 411 \\]\n\\[ 3U + 9 = 411 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( U \\), we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3U = 402 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ U = 134 \\]\n\nNow that we know Uma watched 134 videos, we can find out how many videos Ekon watched by substituting \\( U = 134 \\) into the expression for Ekon:\n\\[ U - 17 = 134 - 17 = 117 \\]\n\nFinally, we can find out how many videos Kelsey watched by substituting \\( U = 134 \\) into the expression for Kelsey:\n\\[ U + 26 = 134 + 26 = 160 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of videos Kelsey watched is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
        "Let's define the number of videos watched by Uma as \\( U \\). According to the problem, Ekon watched 17 less than Uma, so the number of videos watched by Ekon is \\( U - 17 \\).

We do this by subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3U = 411 - 9 \\]\n\\[ 3U = 402 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ U = \\frac{402}{3} \\]\n\\[ U = 134 \\]\n\nSo, Uma watched 134 videos.
