        "To determine the total combined number of grapes in all three bowls, we need to find out how many grapes each person has based on the information given.\n\nFirst, we know that Rob's bowl contains 25 grapes. Let's denote the number of grapes in Rob's bowl as \\( R \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ R = 25 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that Allie's bowl contains two more grapes than Rob's bowl. Let's denote the number of grapes in Allie's bowl as \\( A \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ A = R + 2 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( R \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ A = 25 + 2 = 27 \\]\n\nThen, we are told that Allyn's bowl contains four more grapes than Allie's bowl. Let's denote the number of grapes in Allyn's bowl as \\( L \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ L = A + 4 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( A \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ L = 27 + 4 = 31 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total combined number of grapes in all three bowls. We do this by adding the number of grapes in Rob's bowl, Allie's bowl, and Allyn's bowl:\n\\[ R + A + L = 25 + 27 + 31 \\]\n\nAdding these together, we get:\n\\[ 25 + 27 + 31 = 83 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total combined number of grapes in all three bowls is:\n\\[ \\boxed{83} \\]",

Sum the number of grapes in all three bowls.\n\nGiven that Rob's bowl contained 25 grapes, we can start by calculating the number of grapes in Allie's bowl.
