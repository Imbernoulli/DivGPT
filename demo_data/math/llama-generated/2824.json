        "To determine the total amount of money Thomas and Joseph have in their savings accounts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount Thomas has saved.\n2. Determine how much Joseph saves each month.\n3. Calculate the total amount Joseph has saved.\n4. Add the total amounts saved by Thomas and Joseph.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount Thomas has saved. Thomas saves $40 each month for six years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in six years is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 12 = 72 \\text{ months} \\]\nSo, the total amount Thomas has saved is:\n\\[ 40 \\times 72 = 2880 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's determine how much Joseph saves each month. Joseph saves \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times less money per month than Thomas. This means Joseph saves:\n\\[ 40 - \\left(40 \\times \\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 40 - \\left(40 \\times 0.4\\right) = 40 - 16 = 24 \\text{ dollars per month} \\]\nSo, the total amount Joseph has saved is:\n\\[ 24 \\times 72 = 1728 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total amounts saved by Thomas and Joseph to find the total amount of money they have in their savings accounts altogether:\n\\[ 2880 + 1728 = 4608 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money they are having in their savings account altogether is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4608} \\]",

This means he saves:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ dollars} - \\left(40 \\text{ dollars} \\times \\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 40 \\text{ dollars} - 16 \\text{ dollars} = 24 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount Joseph has saved.**\n\nJoseph saves $24 every month for six years. The total number of months he has been saving is the same as Thomas, which is 72 months. The total amount Joseph has saved is:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ months} \\times 24 \\text{ dollars/month} = 1728 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Add the total amounts saved by Thomas and Joseph.**\n\nThe total amount of money they have in their savings accounts altogether is:\n\\[ 2880 \\text{ dollars} + 1728 \\text{ dollars} = 4608 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money they have in their savings account altogether is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4608} \\]",

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in six years is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 12 = 72 \\text{ months} \\]\nSo, the total amount Thomas has saved is:\n\\[ 40 \\times 72 = 2880 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount Joseph saves each month. Joseph saves \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times less money per month than Thomas. This means Joseph saves:\n\\[ 40 - \\left(40 \\times \\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 40 - \\left(40 \\times 0.4\\right) = 40 - 16 = 24 \\text{ dollars per month} \\]\nSo, the total amount Joseph has saved is:\n\\[ 24 \\times 72 = 1728 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, let's add the total amounts saved by Thomas and Joseph:\n\\[ 2880 + 1728 = 4608 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money they have in their savings account altogether is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4608} \\]",

Add the total amounts saved by Thomas and Joseph.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Thomas has saved.**\n\nThomas saves $40 each month for six years. First, we find out how many months are in six years:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ years} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 72 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount Thomas has saved:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ months} \\times 40 \\text{ dollars/month} = 2880 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much Joseph saves each month.**\n\nJoseph saves \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times less money per month than Thomas. This means Joseph saves:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ dollars} - \\left(40 \\text{ dollars} \\times \\frac{2}{5}\\right) \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of $40:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ dollars} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 16 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, Joseph saves:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ dollars} - 16 \\text{ dollars} = 24 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount Joseph has saved.**\n\nJoseph saves $24 each month for six years. First, we find out how many months are in six years:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ years} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 72 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount Joseph has saved:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ months} \\times 24 \\text{ dollars/month} = 1728 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Add the total amounts saved by Thomas and Joseph.**\n\nFinally, we add the total amounts saved by Thomas and Joseph:\n\\[ 2880 \\text{ dollars} + 1728 \\text{ dollars} = 4608 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money they have in their savings account altogether is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4608} \\]",

Calculate the total amount of money Joseph has saved.\n3. Add the two amounts together to find the total savings.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Thomas has saved. Thomas saves $40 each month for six years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in six years is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 12 = 72 \\text{ months} \\]\nTherefore, the total amount of money Thomas has saved is:\n\\[ 40 \\times 72 = 2880 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of money Joseph has saved. Joseph saves \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times less money per month than Thomas.

Therefore, the total amount of money Joseph has saved is:\n\\[ 24 \\times 72 = 1728 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total amounts saved by Thomas and Joseph to find the total savings:\n\\[ 2880 + 1728 = 4608 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money they have in their savings account altogether is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4608} \\]",

Add the total amounts saved by Thomas and Joseph.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Thomas has saved.**\n\nThomas saves $40 every month for six years. First, we find out how many months are in six years:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ years} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 72 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount Thomas has saved:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ months} \\times 40 \\text{ dollars/month} = 2880 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Joseph saves each month.**\n\nJoseph saves \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times less money per month than Thomas. This means he saves \\(1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}\\) of what Thomas saves each month. Therefore, we calculate Joseph's monthly savings:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times \\frac{3}{5} = 24 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Joseph has saved.**\n\nJoseph saves $24 every month for six years. First, we find out how many months are in six years (which we already know is 72 months).\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount Joseph has saved:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ months} \\times 24 \\text{ dollars/month} = 1728 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Add the total amounts saved by Thomas and Joseph.**\n\nFinally, we add the total amounts saved by Thomas and Joseph to find the total amount they have in their savings accounts altogether:\n\\[ 2880 \\text{ dollars} + 1728 \\text{ dollars} = 4608 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money they have in their savings account altogether is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4608} \\]",
        "To determine the total amount of money Thomas and Joseph have in their savings accounts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount Thomas has saved.\n2.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total amount Thomas has saved as follows:\n\\[\n40 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} \\times 6 \\text{ years} = 2880 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total amount Joseph has saved.**\n\nJoseph saves \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times less money per month than Thomas.

Add the total amounts saved by Thomas and Joseph.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Thomas has saved.**\n\nThomas saves $40 each month for six years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in six years is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 12 = 72 \\]\n\nThe total amount of money Thomas has saved is:\n\\[ 40 \\times 72 = 2880 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much money Joseph saves each month.**\n\nJoseph saves \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times less money per month than Thomas.

Add the amounts saved by Thomas and Joseph.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much money Thomas has saved over six years. Thomas saves $40 each month, and there are 12 months in a year.
