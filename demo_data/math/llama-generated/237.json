        "Let's denote the total number of cups of lemonade Hazel made as \\( x \\).\n\n1. Hazel sold half of her lemonade to a construction crew. Therefore, the amount of lemonade sold to the construction crew is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\).\n2. After selling to the construction crew, the remaining amount of lemonade is \\( x - \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{x}{2} \\).\n3. Hazel sold 18 cups to kids on bikes. Therefore, the amount of lemonade left after selling to the kids is \\( \\frac{x}{2} - 18 \\).\n4. Hazel gave away half the amount she sold to the kids to her friends. Therefore, the amount of lemonade given away is \\( \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\).\n5. After giving away lemonade to her friends, the remaining amount of lemonade is \\( \\frac{x}{2} - 18 - 9 = \\frac{x}{2} - 27 \\).\n6. Hazel drank the last cup of lemonade herself. Therefore, the remaining amount of lemonade is 1. So, we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{2} - 27 = 1\n   \\]\n7. To find \\( x \\), we first add 27 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{2} = 28\n   \\]\n8. Next, we multiply both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = 56\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cups of lemonade Hazel made is \\(\\boxed{56}\\).",
