        "To determine the total number of pizza slices, we need to calculate the number of slices from each type of pizza and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of slices from the small pizzas:\n- Each small pizza has 6 slices.\n- You ordered 4 small pizzas.\n- Therefore, the total number of slices from the small pizzas is:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 6 = 24\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of slices from the medium pizzas:\n- Each medium pizza has 8 slices.\n- You ordered 5 medium pizzas.\n- Therefore, the total number of slices from the medium pizzas is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 8 = 40\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's determine the number of large pizzas ordered.
