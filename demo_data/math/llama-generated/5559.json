        "To determine how many hours it takes to film 4 weeks of episodes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the time it takes to film one episode.\n2. Determine the total time to film one week of episodes.\n3. Calculate the total time to film 4 weeks of episodes.\n4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to film one episode.**\n\nEach episode is 20 minutes long, and it takes 50% longer to film each episode. First, we find 50% of 20 minutes:\n\\[ 20 \\times 0.50 = 10 \\text{ minutes} \\]\nSo, the total time to film one episode is:\n\\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total time to film one week of episodes.**\n\nEach week they show 5 episodes. Therefore, the total time to film one week of episodes is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 5 = 150 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total time to film 4 weeks of episodes.**\n\nTo find the total time to film 4 weeks of episodes, we multiply the time it takes to film one week by 4:\n\\[ 150 \\times 4 = 600 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.**\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour. To convert 600 minutes to hours, we divide by 60:\n\\[ 600 \\div 60 = 10 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total time it takes to film 4 weeks of episodes is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) hours.",
