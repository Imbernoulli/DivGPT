Each bottle costs $2.5, so the total cost is:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ bottles} \\times 2.5 \\text{ dollars per bottle} = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nMarcus walks into the store with 2 $10 bills, so he has a total of:\n\\[\n2 \\times 10 \\text{ dollars} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nAfter buying the water, the amount of change Marcus will have is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ dollars} - 15 \\text{ dollars} = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of change Marcus will have after he buys all the water he needs is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
        "To determine how much change Marcus will have after buying all the water he needs, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of water Marcus needs.\n2. Determine how many bottles of water Marcus needs to buy.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the water.\n4. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Marcus has.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water Marcus needs.**\n\nMarcus has 100 balloons, and each balloon holds 3 ounces of water. Therefore, the total amount of water needed is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ balloons} \\times 3 \\text{ ounces/balloon} = 300 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many bottles of water Marcus needs to buy.**\n\nEach bottle contains 50 ounces of water. To find out how many bottles Marcus needs, we divide the total amount of water needed by the amount of water per bottle:\n\\[ \\frac{300 \\text{ ounces}}{50 \\text{ ounces/bottle}} = 6 \\text{ bottles} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the water.**\n\nEach bottle costs $2.5, so the total cost for 6 bottles is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ bottles} \\times 2.5 \\text{ dollars/bottle} = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Marcus has.**\n\nMarcus walks into the store with 2 $10 bills, so he has:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ bills} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/bill} = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAfter buying the water, the change Marcus will have is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ dollars} - 15 \\text{ dollars} = 5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of change Marcus will have is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
