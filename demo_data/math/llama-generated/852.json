        "To determine how long it takes for Erik's dog to catch up to the rabbit, we need to calculate the time it takes for the dog to close the gap between itself and the rabbit. The dog runs faster than the rabbit, so the difference in their speeds is the rate at which the gap is decreasing.\n\nFirst, we find the difference in their speeds:\n\\[ 24 \\text{ miles per hour} - 15 \\text{ miles per hour} = 9 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nThis means that the dog is closing the gap at a rate of 9 miles per hour. The rabbit has a head start of 0.6 miles. To find out how long it takes for the dog to close this gap, we divide the head start distance by the rate at which the gap is decreasing:\n\\[ \\frac{0.6 \\text{ miles}}{9 \\text{ miles per hour}} = \\frac{0.6}{9} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{6}{90} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{1}{15} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert this time into minutes:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{15} \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 4 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes the dog \\(\\boxed{4}\\) minutes to catch up to the rabbit.",
        "To determine how many minutes it takes for Erik's dog to catch up to the rabbit, we need to calculate the relative speed of the dog compared to the rabbit and then use that to find out how long it takes to cover the head start distance.\n\n1. Calculate the relative speed of the dog with respect to the rabbit:\n   The dog runs at 24 miles per hour and the rabbit runs at 15 miles per hour. Therefore, the dog gains:\n   \\[\n   24 - 15 = 9 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the time it takes for the dog to cover the head start distance:\n   The rabbit has a head start of 0.6 miles. Since the dog gains 9 miles per hour, the time \\( t \\) it takes to cover 0.6 miles is:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{0.6 \\text{ miles}}{9 \\text{ miles per hour}} = \\frac{0.6}{9} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3.

        "To determine how long it takes for Erik's dog to catch up to the rabbit, we need to calculate the relative speed of the dog with respect to the rabbit and then use that to find out how long it will take to cover the initial head start distance.\n\n1. **Calculate the relative speed:**\n   The dog runs at 24 miles per hour and the rabbit runs at 15 miles per hour. The relative speed of the dog with respect to the rabbit is the difference in their speeds:\n   \\[\n   24 - 15 = 9 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the time to cover the head start distance:**\n   The rabbit has a head start of 0.6 miles. To find out how long it will take the dog to cover this distance at a relative speed of 9 miles per hour, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{time} = \\frac{0.6 \\text{ miles}}{9 \\text{ miles per hour}} = \\frac{0.6}{9} = \\frac{1}{15} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the time from hours to minutes:**\n   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert \\(\\frac{1}{15}\\) hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{15} \\times 60 = 4 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes the dog \\(\\boxed{4}\\) minutes to catch up to the rabbit.",
        "To determine how long it takes for Erik's dog to catch up to the rabbit, we need to calculate the time it takes for the dog to cover the initial head start of the rabbit plus the distance the rabbit continues to run while the dog is chasing.\n\nFirst, let's find the relative speed of the dog compared to the rabbit. The dog runs at 24 miles per hour and the rabbit runs at 15 miles per hour. Therefore, the dog is gaining on the rabbit at a rate of:\n\\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how long it takes for the dog to cover the initial 0.6 miles head start.
