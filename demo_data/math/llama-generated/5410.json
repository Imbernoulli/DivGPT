        "To determine the total volume of shampoo and conditioner Sarah uses in two weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the daily use of conditioner:**\n   Sarah uses 1 ounce of shampoo daily. She uses one half as much conditioner as shampoo.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily conditioner use} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\text{ ounce} = 0.5 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total weekly use of shampoo:**\n   Sarah uses 1 ounce of shampoo daily. There are 7 days in a week.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly shampoo use} = 1 \\text{ ounce/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 7 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total weekly use of conditioner:**\n   Sarah uses 0.5 ounces of conditioner daily.

Calculate the total usage over two weeks.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much conditioner Sarah uses daily. She uses one half as much conditioner as shampoo. Since she uses 1 ounce of shampoo daily, we can calculate the conditioner usage as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Daily conditioner usage} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\text{ ounce} = 0.5 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total daily usage of both shampoo and conditioner:\n\\[\n\\text{Total daily usage} = \\text{Daily shampoo usage} + \\text{Daily conditioner usage} = 1 \\text{ ounce} + 0.5 \\text{ ounces} = 1.5 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out the total usage over two weeks.

        "To determine the total volume of shampoo and conditioner Sarah will use in two weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the daily usage of shampoo and conditioner.\n2. Multiply the daily usage by the number of days in two weeks.\n\nFirst, we know that Sarah uses 1 ounce of shampoo daily. She uses one half as much conditioner as shampoo daily. Therefore, the amount of conditioner she uses daily is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ ounce} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total daily usage of shampoo and conditioner:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ ounce of shampoo} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ ounce of conditioner} = 1.5 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nSince there are 14 days in two weeks, we multiply the daily usage by 14:\n\\[ 1.5 \\text{ ounces/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 21 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nThus, the total volume of shampoo and conditioner that Sarah will use in two weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]",
