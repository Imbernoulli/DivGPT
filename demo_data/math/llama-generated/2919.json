        "Let's start by calculating how much Lisa spends on each item.\n\n1. Lisa spends $40 on t-shirts.\n2. Lisa spends half of $40 on jeans:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n   \\]\n3. Lisa spends twice $40 on coats:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 40 = 80\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount Lisa spends:\n\\[\n40 + 20 + 80 = 140\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate how much Carly spends on each item.\n\n1. Carly spends a quarter of $40 on t-shirts:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{4} = 10\n   \\]\n2. Carly spends 3 times $20 on jeans:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 20 = 60\n   \\]\n3. Carly spends a quarter of $80 on coats:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{80}{4} = 20\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount Carly spends:\n\\[\n10 + 60 + 20 = 90\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's find the total amount Lisa and Carly spend together:\n\\[\n140 + 90 = 230\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount Lisa and Carly spend is \\(\\boxed{230}\\).",
        "To determine the total amount spent by Lisa and Carly, we need to calculate each person's total spending step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Lisa's total spending:\n1. Lisa spends $40 on t-shirts.\n2. Lisa spends half of $40 on jeans: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n3. Lisa spends twice $40 on coats:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 40 = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up Lisa's total spending:\n\\[\n40 + 20 + 80 = 140 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate Carly's total spending:\n1. Carly spends a quarter of the amount Lisa spent on t-shirts:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{4} = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n2. Carly spends 3 times the amount Lisa spent on jeans:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 20 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n3. Carly spends a quarter of the amount Lisa spent on coats:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{80}{4} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up Carly's total spending:\n\\[\n10 + 60 + 20 = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add Lisa's and Carly's total spending to find the combined total:\n\\[\n140 + 90 = 230 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount spent by Lisa and Carly is \\boxed{230}."
