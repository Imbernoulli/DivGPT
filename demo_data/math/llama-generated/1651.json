        "To determine how much Jenny spent on the cat in the first year, we need to calculate the costs she claimed to share with her girlfriend and the costs she incurred individually. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Adoption Fee**: The adoption fee is $50. Since Jenny and her girlfriend agreed to split this cost down the middle:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50}{2} = 25\n   \\]\n   So, Jenny paid $25 for the adoption fee.\n\n2. **Vet Visits**: The vet visits cost $500 for the first year. Again, since they split this cost down the middle:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{500}{2} = 250\n   \\]\n   So, Jenny paid $250 for the vet visits.\n\n3. **Monthly Food Cost**: The monthly cost of food is $25. For the first year, there are 12 months, so the total cost of food for the year is:\n   \\[\n   25 \\times 12 = 300\n   \\]\n   Since they split this cost down the middle:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{300}{2} = 150\n   \\]\n   So, Jenny paid $150 for the food.\n\n4. **Toys**: Jenny bought $200 in toys. Since she did not share this cost with her girlfriend, she paid the full $200.\n\nNow, we sum up all the costs Jenny paid:\n\\[\n25 + 250 + 150 + 200 = 625\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jenny spent \\(\\boxed{625}\\) dollars on the cat in the first year.",
