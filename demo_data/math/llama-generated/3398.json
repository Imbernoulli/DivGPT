        "To determine how many slices of pizza are left over, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pizza slices:**\n   Stephen ordered 2 large pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 12 slices.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ pizzas} \\times 12 \\text{ slices per pizza} = 24 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many slices Stephen ate:**\n   Stephen ate 25% of the pizza.\n   \\[\n   25\\% \\text{ of } 24 \\text{ slices} = 0.25 \\times 24 = 6 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of slices remaining after Stephen ate:**\n   Subtract the number of slices Stephen ate from the total number of slices.\n   \\[\n   24 \\text{ slices} - 6 \\text{ slices} = 18 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many slices Pete ate:**\n   Pete ate 50% of the remaining pizza.\n   \\[\n   50\\% \\text{ of } 18 \\text{ slices} = 0.50 \\times 18 = 9 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of slices left over after Pete ate:**\n   Subtract the number of slices Pete ate from the remaining slices.\n   \\[\n   18 \\text{ slices} - 9 \\text{ slices} = 9 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of slices left over is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
        "First, we determine the total number of pizza slices Stephen ordered. Since he ordered 2 large pizzas and each pizza was cut into 12 slices, the total number of slices is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 12 = 24\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many slices Stephen ate. Stephen ate 25% of the pizza.
