        "To determine the price of the couch, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the price of the chair as \\( x \\).\n2. The price of the table is 3 times the price of the chair, so it is \\( 3x \\).\n3. The price of the couch is 5 times the price of the table, so it is \\( 5 \\times 3x = 15x \\).\n4. The total cost of all the items is the sum of the price of the chair, the table, and the couch, which is \\( x + 3x + 15x = 19x \\).\n5. We know that the total cost is $380, so we can set up the equation \\( 19x = 380 \\).\n6. To find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 19: \\( x = \\frac{380}{19} = 20 \\).\n7. The price of the couch is \\( 15x \\), so we substitute \\( x = 20 \\) into the expression: \\( 15 \\times 20 = 300 \\).\n\nTherefore, the price of the couch is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
