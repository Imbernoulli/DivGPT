The race is 10 kilometers long, and he ran the first half (5 kilometers) in 20 minutes and the second half (5 kilometers) in 30 minutes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = 20 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} = 50 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the average time per kilometer. We do this by dividing the total time by the total distance:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average time per kilometer} = \\frac{50 \\text{ minutes}}{10 \\text{ kilometers}} = 5 \\text{ minutes per kilometer}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, TJ's average time per kilometer is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
