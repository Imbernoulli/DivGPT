        "Let's start by determining the number of male and female students in the school. Given that the ratio of male to female students is 3:2 and there are 1000 students in total, we can set up the following equations:\n\nLet \\( m \\) be the number of male students and \\( f \\) be the number of female students. Then we have:\n\\[ m[f = 3[2 \\]\n\\[ m + f = 1000 \\]\n\nWe can substitute \\( m = \\frac{3}{2}f \\) into the second equation:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{2}f + f = 1000 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{3}{2}f + \\frac{2}{2}f = 1000 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{5}{2}f = 1000 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( f \\), we multiply both sides by 2/5:\n\\[ f = 1000 \\times \\frac{2}{5} \\]\n\\[ f = 400 \\]\n\nNow, we can find \\( m \\) by substituting \\( f = 400 \\) back into the equation \\( m = \\frac{3}{2}f \\):\n\\[ m = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 400 \\]\n\\[ m = 600 \\]\n\nSo, there are 600 male students and 400 female students. Next, we need to determine how many students do not like to play basketball. We know that \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of the male students like to play basketball, so the number of male students who like to play basketball is:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\times 600 = 400 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of male students who do not like to play basketball is:\n\\[ 600 - 400 = 200 \\]\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the female students like to play basketball, so the number of female students who like to play basketball is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{5} \\times 400 = 80 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of female students who do not like to play basketball is:\n\\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \\]\n\nThe total number of students who do not like to play basketball is:\n\\[ 200 + 320 = 520 \\]\n\nTo find the percentage of the school population that does not like to play basketball, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of students who do not like basketball}}{\\text{Total number of students}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{520}{1000} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = 52\\% \\]\n\nThus, the percent of the population of the school that do not like to play basketball is:\n\\[ \\boxed{52} \\]",

Since \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the female students like to play basketball, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times 400 = 80\n\\]\n\nThe total number of students who like to play basketball is the sum of the male and female students who like to play basketball:\n\n\\[\n400 + 80 = 480\n\\]\n\nTo find the number of students who do not like to play basketball, we subtract the number of students who like to play basketball from the total number of students:\n\n\\[\n1000 - 480 = 520\n\\]\n\nFinally, we convert the number of students who do not like to play basketball into a percentage of the total student population:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{520}{1000} \\times 100 = 52\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the percent of the population of the school that do not like to play basketball is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{52}\n\\]",
