        "To determine how many days it will take Cary to strip all the ivy off the tree, we need to consider both the rate at which she strips the ivy and the rate at which the ivy grows back. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Daily Net Reduction of Ivy:**\n   - Cary strips 6 feet of ivy every day.\n   - The ivy grows back 2 feet every night.\n   - Therefore, the net reduction of ivy each day is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ feet (stripped)} - 2 \\text{ feet (grown back)} = 4 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Initial Amount of Ivy:**\n   - The tree starts with 40 feet of ivy.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Days:**\n   - We need to find out how many days it will take for the net reduction to reach 0 feet.\n   - Since the net reduction is 4 feet per day, we divide the initial amount of ivy by the net reduction per day:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{40 \\text{ feet}}{4 \\text{ feet/day}} = 10 \\text{ days}\n     \\]\n\nThus, it will take Cary \\(\\boxed{10}\\) days to strip all the ivy off the tree.",
