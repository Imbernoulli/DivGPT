        "To determine how many sandwiches Michelle has left to give to her other co-workers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches Michelle keeps for herself:**\n   Michelle gives 4 sandwiches to one of her co-workers and keeps twice this amount for herself.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, Michelle keeps 8 sandwiches for herself.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of sandwiches Michelle gives away and keeps:**\n   Michelle gives 4 sandwiches to one co-worker and keeps 8 sandwiches for herself.\n   \\[\n   4 + 8 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, Michelle gives away and keeps a total of 12 sandwiches.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of sandwiches Michelle has left:**\n   Michelle originally made 20 sandwiches. After giving away and keeping 12 sandwiches, the number of sandwiches left is:\n   \\[\n   20 - 12 = 8\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of sandwiches Michelle has left to give to her other co-workers is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
