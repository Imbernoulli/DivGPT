        "To determine the number of pages in the old edition of the Geometry book, we start by defining a variable for the unknown quantity. Let \\( x \\) be the number of pages in the old edition.\n\nAccording to the problem, the new edition has 450 pages, which is 230 pages less than twice as many pages as the old edition. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n\\[ 450 = 2x - 230 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) step by step. First, we isolate the term involving \\( x \\) by adding 230 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 450 + 230 = 2x \\]\n\\[ 680 = 2x \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ x = \\frac{680}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 340 \\]\n\nTherefore, the old edition of the Geometry book had \\(\\boxed{340}\\) pages.",

To do this, we start by adding 230 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n450 + 230 = 2x\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\n\\[\n680 = 2x\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{680}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we find:\n\n\\[\nx = 340\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the old edition Geometry book had \\(\\boxed{340}\\) pages.",
