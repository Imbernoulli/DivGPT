        "To determine how many hours Jaydee will take to finish typing a research paper with 4560 words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total time in minutes required to type 4560 words:**\n   Jaydee types 38 words per minute. Therefore, the time \\( T \\) in minutes needed to type 4560 words is given by:\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{4560 \\text{ words}}{38 \\text{ words per minute}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perform the division:**\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{4560}{38}\n   \\]\n   To simplify this, we can perform the division step-by-step:\n   \\[\n   4560 \\div 38 = 120\n   \\]\n\n   So, Jaydee will take 120 minutes to type 4560 words.\n\n3. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**\n   There are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, the time \\( H \\) in hours is:\n   \\[\n   H = \\frac{120 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes per hour}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the division:**\n   \\[\n   H = \\frac{120}{60} = 2\n   \\]\n\n   So, Jaydee will take 2 hours to finish typing the research paper.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
