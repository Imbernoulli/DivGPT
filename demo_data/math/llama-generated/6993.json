        "To determine how many questions Cherry answered correctly, we start by defining the number of questions each person answered correctly in terms of variables and given information.\n\n1. Let \\( C \\) represent the number of questions Cherry answered correctly.\n2. According to the problem, Kim answered 8 more questions correctly than Cherry. Therefore, the number of questions Kim answered correctly is:\n   \\[\n   K = C + 8\n   \\]\n3. Nicole answered 3 fewer questions correctly than Kim. Therefore, the number of questions Nicole answered correctly is:\n   \\[\n   N = K - 3\n   \\]\n4. We are given that Nicole answered 22 questions correctly. So, we can substitute 22 for \\( N \\) in the equation:\n   \\[\n   22 = K - 3\n   \\]\n5. To find \\( K \\), we solve the equation by adding 3 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   K = 22 + 3 = 25\n   \\]\n6. Now that we know Kim answered 25 questions correctly, we substitute 25 for \\( K \\) in the equation \\( K = C + 8 \\):\n   \\[\n   25 = C + 8\n   \\]\n7. To find \\( C \\), we solve the equation by subtracting 8 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   C = 25 - 8 = 17\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Cherry answered \\(\\boxed{17}\\) questions correctly.",

According to the problem, Nicole's score is 22, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ 22 = K - 3 \\]\n\nTo find \\( K \\), we add 3 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ K = 22 + 3 \\]\n\\[ K = 25 \\]\n\nSo, Kim answered 25 questions correctly. Next, we know that Kim answered 8 more questions correctly than Cherry. Let's denote the number of questions Cherry answered correctly as \\( C \\). According to the problem, Kim's score is 25, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ 25 = C + 8 \\]\n\nTo find \\( C \\), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ C = 25 - 8 \\]\n\\[ C = 17 \\]\n\nSo, Cherry answered \\(\\boxed{17}\\) questions correctly.",

This can be simplified to \\( C + 5 \\). We know from the problem that Nicole answered 22 questions correctly, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ C + 5 = 22 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( C \\), we need to isolate \\( C \\) on one side of the equation.
