        "Let's denote the initial number of cookies in the bag as \\( x \\).\n\n1. Jen ate three-quarters of the bag on the first day. So, the number of cookies she ate on the first day is \\( \\frac{3}{4}x \\). The number of cookies remaining after the first day is:\n   \\[\n   x - \\frac{3}{4}x = \\frac{1}{4}x\n   \\]\n\n2.

The number of cookies remaining after the second day is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{1}{8}x = \\frac{2}{8}x - \\frac{1}{8}x = \\frac{1}{8}x\n   \\]\n\n3.
