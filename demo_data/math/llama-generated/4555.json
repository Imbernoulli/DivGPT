Ron's current age is given as 43.\n\nFirst, we calculate Ron's age in five years:\n\\[ 43 + 5 = 48 \\]\n\nNext, we express Maurice's age in five years:\n\\[ m + 5 \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Ron's age in five years will be four times Maurice's age in five years. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 48 = 4(m + 5) \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( m \\). First, we expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 48 = 4m + 20 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate the term with \\( m \\) by subtracting 20 from both sides:\n\\[ 48 - 20 = 4m \\]\n\\[ 28 = 4m \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( m \\) by dividing both sides by 4:\n\\[ m = \\frac{28}{4} \\]\n\\[ m = 7 \\]\n\nSo, Maurice's current age is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
        "To determine Maurice's current age, we start by defining the variables for their ages. Let \\( R \\) be Ron's current age and \\( M \\) be Maurice's current age. According to the problem, Ron's current age is 43, so we have:\n\n\\[ R = 43 \\]\n\nIn five years, Ron's age will be \\( R + 5 \\) and Maurice's age will be \\( M + 5 \\). The problem states that after five years, Ron will be four times as old as Maurice. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\n\\[ R + 5 = 4(M + 5) \\]\n\nNext, we substitute \\( R = 43 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ 43 + 5 = 4(M + 5) \\]\n\nSimplify the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 48 = 4(M + 5) \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( M \\), divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[ 12 = M + 5 \\]\n\nThen, subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\[ M = 7 \\]\n\nSo, Maurice's current age is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]",
