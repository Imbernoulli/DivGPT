        "To determine the lowest grade the absent student can get for the class to still get a pizza party, we need to calculate the total score required for the class to have an average score higher than 75%. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total score of the 24 students who took the test.\n2. Determine the minimum total score needed for all 25 students to have an average score higher than 75%.\n3. Find the lowest possible score the absent student can get to meet this minimum total score.\n\nFirst, calculate the total score of the 24 students:\n\\[ \\text{Total score of 24 students} = \\text{Average score} \\times \\text{Number of students} = 77 \\times 24 = 1848 \\]\n\nNext, determine the minimum total score needed for all 25 students to have an average score higher than 75%. Since the average needs to be greater than 75%, the total score must be greater than:\n\\[ \\text{Minimum total score needed} = 75 \\times 25 = 1875 \\]\n\nNow, find the lowest possible score the absent student can get by subtracting the total score of the 24 students from the minimum total score needed:\n\\[ \\text{Lowest score for absent student} = \\text{Minimum total score needed} - \\text{Total score of 24 students} = 1875 - 1848 = 27 \\]\n\nTherefore, the lowest grade the absent student can get for the class to still get a pizza party is \\(\\boxed{27}\\).",
        "To determine the lowest grade the absent student can get for the class to still get a pizza party, we need to calculate the overall average score of all 25 students and ensure it is higher than 75%.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total score of the 24 students who took the test. The average score of these 24 students is 77%. Therefore, the total score for these 24 students is:\n\\[\n77 \\times 24 = 1848\n\\]\n\nNext, let \\( x \\) be the score of the absent student. The total score for all 25 students will then be:\n\\[\n1848 + x\n\\]\n\nFor the class to get a pizza party, the average score of all 25 students must be greater than 75%.

Therefore, we set up the following inequality:\n\\[ \\frac{1848 + x}{25} \\geq 75 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 25:\n\\[ 1848 + x \\geq 75 \\times 25 \\]\n\\[ 1848 + x \\geq 1875 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting 1848 from both sides of the inequality:\n\\[ x \\geq 1875 - 1848 \\]\n\\[ x \\geq 27 \\]\n\nTherefore, the lowest grade the absent student can get for the class to still get a pizza party is:\n\\[ \\boxed{27} \\]",
