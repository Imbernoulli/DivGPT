        "To determine the total number of points Team Soccer Stars earned at the end of the season, we need to calculate the points from each type of result (wins, draws, and losses) and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we find out how many games the team drew. Since they played a total of 20 games, and won 14 games and lost 2 games, the number of draws is:\n\\[ 20 - 14 - 2 = 4 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the points earned from the wins. Since they won 14 games and each win earns them 3 points, the points from wins are:\n\\[ 14 \\times 3 = 42 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the points earned from the draws. Since they drew 4 games and each draw earns them 1 point, the points from draws are:\n\\[ 4 \\times 1 = 4 \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the points earned from the losses. Since they lost 2 games and each loss earns them 0 points, the points from losses are:\n\\[ 2 \\times 0 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the points from wins, draws, and losses to find the total points at the end of the season:\n\\[ 42 + 4 + 0 = 46 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of points Team Soccer Stars had at the end of the season is \\(\\boxed{46}\\).",
