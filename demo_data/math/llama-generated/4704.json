        "To determine how long it will take Mike to type a document with 810 words given his reduced typing speed, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Mike's original typing speed and his reduced typing speed.\n   - Mike's original typing speed is 65 words per minute.\n   - After the accident, his typing speed is reduced by 20 words per minute.\n   - Therefore, his new typing speed is \\(65 - 20 = 45\\) words per minute.\n\n2. Calculate the time it takes for Mike to type 810 words at his new typing speed.\n   - Time is calculated by dividing the total number of words by the typing speed.\n   - So, the time it takes Mike to type 810 words is \\(810 \\div 45\\).\n\n3. Perform the division.\n   - \\(810 \\div 45 = 18\\).\n\nTherefore, it will take Mike \\(\\boxed{18}\\) minutes to finish typing the document.",
