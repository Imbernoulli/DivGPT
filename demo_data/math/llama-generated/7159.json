Determine how much money they invest in stocks (which is half of their total savings).\n5. Calculate the number of shares of stocks they can buy with the invested money.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. **Total savings by the wife in 4 months:**\n   - The wife saves $100 every week.\n   - There are 4 weeks in a month.\n   - Therefore, in one month, she saves \\( 100 \\times 4 = 400 \\) dollars.\n   - Over 4 months, she saves \\( 400 \\times 4 = 1600 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Total savings by the husband in 4 months:**\n   - The husband saves $225 every month.\n   - Therefore, in 4 months, he saves \\( 225 \\times 4 = 900 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Total savings by the couple:**\n   - Adding the savings of the wife and the husband: \\( 1600 + 900 = 2500 \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Amount invested in stocks:**\n   - They invest half of their total savings: \\( \\frac{2500}{2} = 1250 \\) dollars.\n\n5. **Number of shares of stocks they can buy:**\n   - Each share costs $50.\n   - Therefore, the number of shares they can buy is \\( \\frac{1250}{50} = 25 \\).\n\nThus, the number of shares of stocks they can buy is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
        "To determine how many shares of stocks the married couple can buy, we need to calculate their total savings after 4 months and then find out how much they invest in stocks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the wife's total savings over 4 months. Since she saves $100 every week, we need to find out how many weeks are in 4 months. Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, we have:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ months} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 16 \\text{ weeks} \\]\nSo, the wife's total savings is:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ weeks} \\times \\$100/\\text{week} = \\$1600 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the husband's total savings over 4 months.

Determine half of the total savings to find out how much they invest.\n5. Calculate the number of shares of stocks they can buy with the invested amount.\n\nLet's start with the wife's savings. The wife saves $100 every week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she saves $100 * 4 = $400 each month. Over 4 months, she saves $400 * 4 = $1600.\n\nNext, let's calculate the husband's savings. The husband saves $225 every month. Over 4 months, he saves $225 * 4 = $900.\n\nNow, we add the amounts saved by the wife and the husband to find the total savings:\n$1600 + $900 = $2500.\n\nThey decide to invest half of their money in buying stocks. So, we calculate half of $2500:\n$2500 / 2 = $1250.\n\nEach share of stocks costs $50.
