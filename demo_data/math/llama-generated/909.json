        "To determine how many candles will be on Rupert's cake, we first need to find out Rupert's age. We know that Rupert is 3 and 1/2 times older than Peter. Since Peter is 10 years old, we can calculate Rupert's age by multiplying Peter's age by 3.5.\n\nFirst, let's convert 3 and 1/2 into an improper fraction or a decimal. The mixed number 3 and 1/2 can be written as 3.5 in decimal form. Now, we multiply:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 3.5 = 10 \\times \\left(3 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 10 \\times 3 + 10 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 30 + 5 = 35\n\\]\n\nSo, Rupert is 35 years old. Therefore, the number of candles on Rupert's cake will be:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{35}\n\\]",

Therefore, we need to multiply Peter's age by 7/2 to find Rupert's age:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rupert's age} = 10 \\times \\frac{7}{2}\n\\]\n\nTo perform the multiplication, we multiply 10 by 7 and then divide by 2:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times \\frac{7}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 7}{2} = \\frac{70}{2} = 35\n\\]\n\nSo, Rupert is 35 years old. Since Rupert's cake will have as many candles as his age, the number of candles on Rupert's cake is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{35}\n\\]",
        "To determine the number of candles on Rupert's cake, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Peter's age from the number of candles on his cake.\n2. Calculate Rupert's age based on the given ratio.\n3. Determine the number of candles on Rupert's cake, which is equal to his age.\n\nStep 1: Peter's age is equal to the number of candles on his cake. Since Peter has 10 candles on his cake, Peter is 10 years old.\n\nStep 2: Rupert is 3 and 1/2 times older than Peter. We can express 3 and 1/2 as the improper fraction 7/2. Therefore, we need to multiply Peter's age by 7/2 to find Rupert's age.\n\\[\n\\text{Rupert's age} = 10 \\times \\frac{7}{2} = 10 \\times 3.5 = 35\n\\]\nSo, Rupert is 35 years old.\n\nStep 3: The number of candles on Rupert's cake is equal to his age, which is 35.\n\nThus, the number of candles on Rupert's cake is \\boxed{35}.",

        "To determine how many candles will be on Rupert's cake, we need to find out Rupert's age and then place that number of candles on his cake. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify Peter's age. According to the problem, Peter has 10 candles on his cake, so Peter is 10 years old.\n2. Determine Rupert's age. The problem states that Rupert is 3 and 1/2 times older than Peter. We can convert 3 and 1/2 into an improper fraction or a decimal. 3 and 1/2 is equivalent to 3.5 in decimal form. Therefore, we multiply Peter's age by 3.5 to find Rupert's age:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rupert's age} = 10 \\times 3.5 = 35\n   \\]\n3.
