        "To determine Jessica's current age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Claire's current age:**\n   - We know that in two years, Claire will be 20 years old.\n   - Therefore, Claire's current age is:\n     \\[\n     20 - 2 = 18\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine Jessica's current age:**\n   - Jessica is six years older than Claire.\n   - Since Claire is currently 18 years old, Jessica's current age is:\n     \\[\n     18 + 6 = 24\n     \\]\n\nThus, Jessica is currently \\(\\boxed{24}\\) years old.",
        "To determine Jessica's current age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Claire's current age.\n2. Use the relationship between Jessica's and Claire's ages to find Jessica's current age.\n\nFirst, we know that in two years, Claire will be 20 years old. Therefore, we can find Claire's current age by subtracting 2 from 20:\n\\[\n20 - 2 = 18\n\\]\nSo, Claire is currently 18 years old.\n\nNext, we know that Jessica is six years older than Claire. Therefore, we can find Jessica's current age by adding 6 to Claire's current age:\n\\[\n18 + 6 = 24\n\\]\nSo, Jessica is currently 24 years old.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]",

        "To determine Jessica's current age, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Claire's current age:**\n   - We know that in two years, Claire will be 20 years old.\n   - Therefore, Claire's current age is:\n     \\[\n     20 - 2 = 18\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine Jessica's current age:**\n   - Jessica is six years older than Claire.\n   - Since Claire is currently 18 years old, Jessica's current age is:\n     \\[\n     18 + 6 = 24\n     \\]\n\nThus, Jessica is currently \\(\\boxed{24}\\) years old.",
