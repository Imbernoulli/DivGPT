Calculate the total cost of the petunias.\n4. Add the costs of all the flowers to find the total cost before the discount.\n5. Calculate the discount amount.\n6. Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the total amount paid.\n7. Subtract the total amount paid from the amount Simon paid with to find the change.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the pansies:**\n   Simon bought 5 pansies at $2.50 each.\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 2.50 = 12.50\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the pansies is $12.50.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the hydrangea:**\n   Simon bought 1 hydrangea at $12.50.\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 12.50 = 12.50\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the hydrangea is $12.50.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the petunias:**\n   Simon bought 5 petunias at $1.00 each.\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 1.00 = 5.00\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the petunias is $5.00.\n\n4. **Add the costs of all the flowers to find the total cost before the discount:**\n   \\[\n   12.50 + 12.50 + 5.00 = 30.00\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost before the discount is $30.00.\n\n5. **Calculate the discount amount:**\n   The garden center is offering a 10% discount.\n   \\[\n   10\\% \\text{ of } 30.00 = 0.10 \\times 30.00 = 3.00\n   \\]\n   So, the discount amount is $3.00.\n\n6. **Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the total amount paid:**\n   \\[\n   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount paid is $27.00.\n\n7. **Subtract the total amount paid from the amount Simon paid with to find the change:**\n   Simon paid with a $50 bill.\n   \\[\n   50.00 - 27.00 = 23.00\n   \\]\n   So, the change Simon would receive back is $23.00.\n\nTherefore, the change Simon would receive is \\boxed{23}.",
        "To determine how much change Simon would receive, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the flowers before the discount.\n2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.\n3. Subtract the discounted total from the amount Simon paid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the flowers before the discount:\n\n- The cost of the 5 pansies is \\(5 \\times 2.50 = 12.50\\) dollars.\n- The cost of the 1 hydrangea is \\(12.50\\) dollars.\n- The cost of the 5 petunias is \\(5 \\times 1.00 = 5.00\\) dollars.\n\nAdding these amounts together gives:\n\\[12.50 + 12.50 + 5.00 = 30.00\\] dollars.\n\nNext, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:\n\\[30.00 \\times 0.10 = 3.00\\] dollars discount.\n\nSubtracting the discount from the original total cost gives:\n\\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\\] dollars.\n\nFinally, subtracting the discounted total from the amount Simon paid gives:\n\\[50.00 - 27.00 = 23.00\\] dollars.\n\nTherefore, the amount of change Simon would receive back from his purchase is \\(\\boxed{23}\\).",
