Since one time around the block equals 200 meters, the total distance Johnny runs is:\n\\[ \\text{Distance run by Johnny} = 4 \\times 200 = 800 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total distance run by Mickey. Similarly, the total distance Mickey runs is:\n\\[ \\text{Distance run by Mickey} = 2 \\times 200 = 400 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNow, we find the sum of the distances run by Johnny and Mickey:\n\\[ \\text{Total distance} = 800 + 400 = 1200 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nFinally, we divide the total distance by 2 to find the average distance run by Johnny and Mickey:\n\\[ \\text{Average distance} = \\frac{1200}{2} = 600 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the average distance run by Johnny and Mickey is \\(\\boxed{600}\\).",
