The truck driver needs to put gas in his truck at one gas station, but wants to put the minimum amount he needs to get him to a much cheaper gas station 90 miles away. He already has 12 gallons of gas in his tank. How many more gallons does the truck driver need to put in his semi to make it to the cheaper gas station?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many more gallons of gas the truck driver needs to put in his semi to make it to the cheaper gas station, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of gas required to travel 90 miles:**\n   The truck driver's semi truck goes 3 miles per gallon of gas. Therefore, the total amount of gas needed for a 90-mile trip is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total gas needed} = \\frac{90 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ miles per gallon}} = 30 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the amount of gas already in the tank:**\n   The truck driver already has 12 gallons of gas in his tank.\n\n3. **Calculate the additional gas needed:**\n   To find out how many more gallons the truck driver needs to put in his semi, we subtract the amount of gas already in the tank from the total amount of gas required:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional gas needed} = \\text{Total gas needed} - \\text{Gas already in the tank} = 30 \\text{ gallons} - 12 \\text{ gallons} = 18 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the truck driver needs to put in \\boxed{18} more gallons of gas to make it to the cheaper gas station.",
