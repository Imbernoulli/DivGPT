Alice's friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of paper cranes Alice's friend folds} = \\frac{500}{5} = 100\n   \\]\n\n4. The number of paper cranes Alice still needs to fold is the remaining paper cranes after her friend folds his share.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of paper cranes Alice still needs to fold} = 500 - 100 = 400\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of paper cranes Alice still needs to fold is \\(\\boxed{400}\\).",
        "To determine how many paper cranes Alice still needs to fold, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of cranes Alice folds by herself:**\n   Alice wants a total of 1000 cranes.
