        "To determine the total cost of 8 chairs after the discounts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discounted price of each chair after the initial 25% off.\n2. Determine how many chairs are over the 5-chair threshold and calculate the additional discount on these chairs.\n3. Compute the total cost by adding the cost of the first 5 chairs and the cost of the additional 3 chairs after the additional discount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discounted price of each chair after the initial 25% off:\n\\[ \\text{Original price of each chair} = \\$20 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Discount} = 25\\% = 0.25 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Discounted price of each chair} = 20 \\times (1 - 0.25) = 20 \\times 0.75 = \\$15 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the additional discount for the chairs over the 5-chair threshold. Since we are buying 8 chairs, the number of chairs over 5 is:\n\\[ 8 - 5 = 3 \\]\nThe additional discount is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) off the discounted price of these 3 chairs. Therefore, the additional discount per chair is:\n\\[ \\text{Additional discount per chair} = 15 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\$5 \\]\nSo, the price of each of the additional 3 chairs after the additional discount is:\n\\[ \\text{Price of each additional chair} = 15 - 5 = \\$10 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cost of the 8 chairs. The cost of the first 5 chairs is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 15 = \\$75 \\]\nThe cost of the additional 3 chairs is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = \\$30 \\]\nTherefore, the total cost of all 8 chairs is:\n\\[ 75 + 30 = \\$105 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]",
        "To determine the total cost of the 8 chairs after the discounts, we can break down the problem into several steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the discount on each chair:**\n   The original price of each chair is $20. Since all chairs are 25% off, the discount on each chair is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 0.25 = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the price of each chair after the initial discount is:\n   \\[\n   20 - 5 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of chairs that receive the additional discount:**\n   Since you bought 8 chairs and the additional discount applies only to the chairs over 5, the number of chairs that receive the additional discount is:\n   \\[\n   8 - 5 = 3 \\text{ chairs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the additional discount on the extra chairs:**\n   The additional discount is 1/3 off the discounted price of each of the extra chairs. The discounted price of each chair after the initial discount is $15, so the additional discount on each extra chair is:\n   \\[\n   15 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the price of each extra chair after the additional discount is:\n   \\[\n   15 - 5 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of the chairs:**\n   - The cost of the first 5 chairs is:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 15 = 75 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - The cost of the remaining 3 chairs is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - The total cost of all 8 chairs is:\n     \\[\n     75 + 30 = 105 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the chairs is \\(\\boxed{105}\\).",

Calculate the final total cost after both discounts.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discount on the original price of the chairs.**\n\nThe original price of each chair is $20. Since all chairs are 25% off, the discount on each chair is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 0.25 = 5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the price of each chair after the initial discount is:\n\\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the additional discount for buying more than 5 chairs.**\n\nSince you bought 8 chairs, the number of chairs over 5 is:\n\\[ 8 - 5 = 3 \\]\n\nThe additional discount is 1/3 off the discounted price of the number of chairs over 5. The discounted price of each chair over 5 is $15, so the total discounted price for the 3 chairs over 5 is:\n\\[ 15 \\times 3 = 45 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe additional discount on these 3 chairs is:\n\\[ 45 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the price of the 3 chairs over 5 after the additional discount is:\n\\[ 45 - 15 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final total cost after both discounts.**\n\nThe total cost for the 5 chairs that were not over 5 is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 15 = 75 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total cost for the 3 chairs that were over 5 is $30. Therefore, the total cost for all 8 chairs is:\n\\[ 75 + 30 = 105 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]",
        "To determine the total cost of 8 chairs after the discounts, we can break down the problem into several steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the discount on all chairs:**\n   The original price of each chair is $20.

Determine the additional discount for the chairs over 5.\n3. Compute the final total cost.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discount on all 8 chairs.**\n\nThe original price of each chair is $20. Since all chairs are 25% off, the discount on each chair is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 0.25 = 5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the price of each chair after the initial discount is:\n\\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFor 8 chairs, the total cost after the initial discount is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 15 = 120 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the additional discount for the chairs over 5.**\n\nSince you bought 8 chairs, the number of chairs over 5 is:\n\\[ 8 - 5 = 3 \\]\n\nThe additional discount is 1/3 off the discounted price of these 3 chairs. The discounted price of each chair is $15, so the additional discount on each of these 3 chairs is:\n\\[ 15 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the price of each of these 3 chairs after the additional discount is:\n\\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFor these 3 chairs, the total cost after the additional discount is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Compute the final total cost.**\n\nThe cost of the 5 chairs that were not over 5 is still $15 each, so the total cost for these 5 chairs is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 15 = 75 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the cost of the 3 chairs that were over 5, the final total cost is:\n\\[ 75 + 30 = 105 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of the 8 chairs is:\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]",
        "First, we calculate the discount on the original price of each chair. The original price of each chair is $20, and there is a 25% discount. Therefore, the discount amount per chair is:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 0.25 = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the price of each chair after the initial discount is:\n\n\\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \\]\n\nNext, we determine the additional discount for buying more than 5 chairs. Since you bought 8 chairs, the number of chairs over 5 is:\n\n\\[ 8 - 5 = 3 \\]\n\nThe additional discount is 1/3 off the discounted price of these 3 chairs. The discounted price of each chair is $15, so the total discount for the 3 extra chairs is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 15 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the 3 extra chairs after the additional discount is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 15 - 15 = 45 - 15 = 30 \\]\n\nThe total cost of the first 5 chairs is:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 15 = 75 \\]\n\nAdding the cost of the first 5 chairs and the cost of the extra 3 chairs gives us the total cost for all 8 chairs:\n\n\\[ 75 + 30 = 105 \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of the chairs is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]",
        "To determine the total cost of 8 chairs at Big Lots, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discount on the first 5 chairs.\n2. Calculate the discount on the additional 3 chairs.\n3. Add the discounted costs together.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discount on the first 5 chairs.**\n\nThe original price of each chair is $20. The discount on each chair is 25%, so the price after the discount for each chair is:\n\\[ 20 \\times (1 - 0.25) = 20 \\times 0.75 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total cost for the first 5 chairs is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 15 = 75 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discount on the additional 3 chairs.**\n\nSince you bought more than 5 chairs, you get an additional 1/3 off the discounted price of the number of chairs over 5. The number of chairs over 5 is:\n\\[ 8 - 5 = 3 \\]\n\nThe discount on each of these additional chairs is 1/3 off the already discounted price of $15, so the price after the additional discount for each chair is:\n\\[ 15 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 15 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total cost for the additional 3 chairs is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the discounted costs together.**\n\nThe total cost for all 8 chairs is the sum of the cost of the first 5 chairs and the cost of the additional 3 chairs:\n\\[ 75 + 30 = 105 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the chairs is:\n\\[ \\boxed{105} \\]"
