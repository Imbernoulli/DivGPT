        "To determine the total amount of ounces eaten by the winner, we need to calculate the total weight of ravioli consumed by both Javier and his brother.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of ravioli eaten by Javier:\n- Javier eats 5 meat ravioli, and each meat ravioli weighs 1.5 ounces. So, the weight of the meat ravioli he eats is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 1.5 = 7.5 \\text{ ounces}\n  \\]\n- Javier eats 2 pumpkin ravioli, and each pumpkin ravioli weighs 1.25 ounces. So, the weight of the pumpkin ravioli he eats is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 1.25 = 2.5 \\text{ ounces}\n  \\]\n- Javier eats 4 cheese ravioli, and each cheese ravioli weighs 1 ounce. So, the weight of the cheese ravioli he eats is:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 1 = 4 \\text{ ounces}\n  \\]\n- Adding these amounts together gives the total weight of ravioli eaten by Javier:\n  \\[\n  7.5 + 2.5 + 4 = 14 \\text{ ounces}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total weight of ravioli eaten by Javier's brother:\n- Javier's brother eats 12 pumpkin ravioli, and each pumpkin ravioli weighs 1.25 ounces.
