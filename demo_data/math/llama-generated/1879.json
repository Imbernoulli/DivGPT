There are corresponding points given for each round. That is 2, 3, and 5 points for every correct answer in the easy, average, and hard rounds, respectively. Suppose Kim got 6 correct answers in the easy; 2 correct answers in the average; and 4 correct answers in the difficult round, what are her total points in the contest?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
