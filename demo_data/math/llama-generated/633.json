        "To find the average distance traveled per day, we first need to determine the total distance traveled over the three days. We do this by adding the distances traveled each day.\n\nThe distance traveled on Monday is 12 miles.\nThe distance traveled on Tuesday is 18 miles.\nThe distance traveled on Wednesday is 21 miles.\n\nAdding these distances together, we get:\n\\[ 12 + 18 + 21 = 51 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the average distance traveled per day. Since the total distance traveled is 51 miles over 3 days, we divide the total distance by the number of days:\n\\[ \\frac{51}{3} = 17 \\text{ miles per day} \\]\n\nTherefore, the average distance traveled per day is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",
