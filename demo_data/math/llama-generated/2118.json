        "To determine how many wipes Elsie had in the container in the morning, we need to follow the sequence of events that affect the number of wipes throughout the day. Let's denote the number of wipes Elsie had in the morning as \\( x \\).\n\n1. Elsie uses up 20 wipes.\n2. She then refills the container with 10 wipes.\n3. By nighttime, she has 60 wipes left.\n\nWe can express this sequence mathematically as:\n\\[ x - 20 + 10 = 60 \\]\n\nNow, let's simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ x - 10 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by adding 10 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 60 + 10 \\]\n\\[ x = 70 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of wipes Elsie had in the container in the morning is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",
        "Let's denote the number of wipes Elsie had in the container in the morning as \\( x \\). According to the problem, throughout the day, she uses up 20 wipes and then refills the container with 10 wipes. This means that each time she uses wipes, the number of wipes in the container decreases by \\( 20 - 10 = 10 \\) wipes.\n\nBy nighttime, she has 60 wipes left. So, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation:\n\n\\[ x - 10n = 60 \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of times Elsie uses wipes during the day. Since we don't know the value of \\( n \\) directly, we need to determine it from the information given. However, the equation tells us that the number of wipes used is a multiple of 10, and the final number of wipes is 60.\n\nLet's consider the possible values of \\( x \\). Since \\( x \\) is the initial number of wipes and after using and refilling the wipes, she has 60 wipes left, \\( x \\) must be greater than or equal to 60. Also, since she uses wipes in multiples of 10 and refills with 10, the smallest possible value of \\( x \\) that would result in 60 wipes by the end of the day is 60 plus some multiple of 10. Let's test the smallest possible value:\n\nIf \\( x = 60 + 10 = 70 \\), then after one use and refill, the number of wipes would be \\( 70 - 10 = 60 \\). This satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, the number of wipes Elsie had in the container in the morning is \\( \\boxed{70} \\).",

This means that for each cycle of using and refilling, the net change in the number of wipes is \\( -20 + 10 = -10 \\).\n3. By nighttime, she has 60 wipes left.

Let's say she went through \\( n \\) cycles of using wipes and refilling. Then, the relationship between the number of wipes in the morning and the number of wipes at nighttime can be expressed as:\n\\[ x - 10n = 60 \\]\n\nWe need to determine the value of \\( x \\). Since \\( x \\) must be a non-negative integer, and \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer, \\( x \\) must be at least 60 (because if \\( x < 60 \\), then \\( x - 10n \\) would be less than 60).
