        "To determine how many brownies Annie has left, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of brownies given to the school administrator:**\n   Annie一位 half of the 20 brownies to the school administrator.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n   \\]\n   So, she gave 10 brownies to the school administrator.\n\n2. **Determine the number of brownies remaining after giving some to the school administrator:**\n   Subtract the number of brownies given to the school administrator from the total number of brownies.\n   \\[\n   20 - 10 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, she has 10 brownies left.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of brownies given to Carl:**\n   Annie gave half of the remaining 10 brownies to her best friend, Carl.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, she gave 5 brownies to Carl.\n\n4. **Determine the number of brownies remaining after giving some to Carl:**\n   Subtract the number of brownies given to Carl from the remaining brownies.\n   \\[\n   10 - 5 = 5\n   \\]\n   So, she has 5 brownies left.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of brownies given to Simon:**\n   Annie gave 2 brownies to her friend, Simon.\n   \\[\n   5 - 2 = 3\n   \\]\n   So, she gave 2 brownies to Simon.\n\n6. **Determine the number of brownies remaining after giving some to Simon:**\n   Subtract the number of brownies given to Simon from the remaining brownies.\n   \\[\n   5 - 2 = 3\n   \\]\n   So, she has 3 brownies left.\n\nTherefore, the number of brownies Annie has left is \\boxed{3}.",
