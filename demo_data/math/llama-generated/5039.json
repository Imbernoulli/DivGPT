        "To determine the number of Asian countries Cornelia has visited, we start by identifying the total number of countries she has visited and subtracting the number of countries she has visited in Europe and South America.\n\nFirst, we know the total number of countries Cornelia has visited is 42. She has visited 20 countries in Europe and 10 countries in South America. So, the number of countries she has visited outside of Europe and South America is:\n\\[ 42 - 20 - 10 = 12 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that half of the remaining countries (which are not in Europe or South America) are in Asia. Therefore, the number of Asian countries she has visited is:\n\\[ \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\]\n\nThus, the number of Asian countries Cornelia has visited is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
