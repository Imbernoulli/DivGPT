Her electricity bill costs $60, and this is paid in full. Her gas bill was $40, and she has already paid three-quarters of this. She makes another payment of $5 towards her gas bill while checking her budget. Her water bill is $40, which she has paid half of, and her internet bill is $25, which she has made 4 payments of $5 towards. Overall, how many dollars does Stephanie still need to pay to finish paying her bills?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
