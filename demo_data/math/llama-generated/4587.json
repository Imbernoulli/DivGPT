Calculate the total number of strawberries picked by Lilibeth and her three friends.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of strawberries Lilibeth picks. Lilibeth fills 6 baskets, and each basket holds 50 strawberries. Therefore, the total number of strawberries Lilibeth picks is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 50 = 300 \\]\n\nNext, we know that each of Lilibeth's three friends picks the same amount of strawberries as she does. So, each friend picks 300 strawberries. The total number of strawberries picked by her three friends is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 300 = 900 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of strawberries picked by Lilibeth to the number of strawberries picked by her three friends to get the total number of strawberries picked by Lilibeth and her friends:\n\\[ 300 + 900 = 1200 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of strawberries picked by Lilibeth and her friends is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1200} \\]"
