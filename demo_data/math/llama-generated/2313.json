To find the increase in salary, we multiply $6000 by 30% (or 0.30):\n\n\\[ 6000 \\times 0.30 = 1800 \\]\n\nSo, his new monthly salary is:\n\n\\[ 6000 + 1800 = 7800 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Kirt's total earnings for the first year.**\n\nSince Kirt's initial monthly salary is $6000 and he worked for one year (12 months), his total earnings for the first year are:\n\n\\[ 6000 \\times 12 = 72000 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Kirt's total earnings for the second and third years.**\n\nKirt's monthly salary after the first year is $7800. Since he worked for two more years (24 months), his total earnings for the second and third years are:\n\n\\[ 7800 \\times 24 = 187200 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Sum up the earnings from all three years.**\n\nTo find Kirt's total earnings after 3 years, we add his earnings from the first year to his earnings from the second and third years:\n\n\\[ 72000 + 187200 = 259200 \\]\n\nTherefore, Kirt's total earnings after 3 years are:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{259200} \\]",
