        "To determine how many apples Grace will have after 6 weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of apples Bella eats in one week.\n2. Use this to find out how many apples Grace picks in one week.\n3. Calculate the total number of apples Grace picks in six weeks.\n4. Determine how many apples Grace will have after consumption.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of apples Bella eats in one week. Since Bella eats 6 apples a day, in one week (7 days) she eats:\n\\[ 6 \\times 7 = 42 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Bella consumes a third of the apples Grace picks in a week. Therefore, the number of apples Grace picks in one week is:\n\\[ 42 \\times 3 = 126 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of apples Grace picks in six weeks:\n\\[ 126 \\times 6 = 756 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nAfter six weeks, Grace will have picked 756 apples and Bella will have consumed:\n\\[ 42 \\times 6 = 252 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nSo, the number of apples Grace will have after 6 weeks is:\n\\[ 756 - 252 = 504 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{504} \\]",

Bella eats 6 apples each day, so in one week (which has 7 days) she eats:\n\\[ 6 \\times 7 = 42 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Bella consumes a third of the apples Grace picks. Therefore, the total number of apples Grace picks in one week is:\n\\[ 42 \\times 3 = 126 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many apples Grace picks in 6 weeks. Since she picks 126 apples each week, in 6 weeks she picks:\n\\[ 126 \\times 6 = 756 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nAfter 6 weeks, Grace will have picked 756 apples and Bella will have eaten:\n\\[ 42 \\times 6 = 252 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nThe number of apples Grace will have after 6 weeks is the total number of apples she picks minus the total number of apples Bella eats:\n\\[ 756 - 252 = 504 \\]\n\nThus, the number of apples Grace will have after 6 weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{504} \\]",

Subtract the total number of apples Bella eats in six weeks from the total number of apples Grace picks in six weeks to find out how many apples Grace will have after six weeks.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n1.

Therefore, the number of apples Grace picks in one week is:\n\\[ 42 \\text{ apples/week} \\times 3 = 126 \\text{ apples/week} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apples Grace picks in 6 weeks.**\n\nSince Grace picks 126 apples each week, over 6 weeks she will pick:\n\\[ 126 \\text{ apples/week} \\times 6 \\text{ weeks} = 756 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine how many apples Grace will have after 6 weeks, assuming she starts with enough apples to cover Bella's consumption.**\n\nAfter 6 weeks, Grace will have picked 756 apples and Bella will have consumed:\n\\[ 42 \\text{ apples/week} \\times 6 \\text{ weeks} = 252 \\text{ apples} \\]\nSince Grace picks enough apples to cover Bella's consumption, she will have:\n\\[ 756 \\text{ apples} - 252 \\text{ apples} = 504 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of apples Grace will have after 6 weeks is \\(\\boxed{504}\\).",
        "First, we need to determine how many apples Bella eats in one week. Since Bella eats 6 apples a day, we calculate the weekly consumption as follows:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ apples/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 42 \\text{ apples/week}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Bella consumes a third of the apples Grace picks in a week. Therefore, the total number of apples Grace picks in one week is:\n\\[\n42 \\text{ apples/week} \\times 3 = 126 \\text{ apples/week}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many apples Grace picks in 6 weeks. We do this by multiplying the weekly pick by 6:\n\\[\n126 \\text{ apples/week} \\times 6 \\text{ weeks} = 756 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate how many apples Grace will have after 6 weeks by subtracting the total number of apples Bella consumes in 6 weeks from the total number of apples Grace picks in 6 weeks. Bella consumes 42 apples per week, so in 6 weeks she consumes:\n\\[\n42 \\text{ apples/week} \\times 6 \\text{ weeks} = 252 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of apples Grace will have after 6 weeks is:\n\\[\n756 \\text{ apples} - 252 \\text{ apples} = 504 \\text{ apples}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{504}\n\\]",
