        "To determine the total weight loss of Seth, Jerome, and Veronica, we need to calculate each person's weight loss individually and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **Seth's weight loss:**\n   Seth lost 17.5 pounds.\n\n2. **Jerome's weight loss:**\n   Jerome lost three times as many pounds as Seth. Therefore, we multiply Seth's weight loss by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 17.5 = 52.5\n   \\]\n   So, Jerome lost 52.5 pounds.\n\n3. **Veronica's weight loss:**\n   Veronica lost 1.5 pounds more than Seth. Therefore, we add 1.5 pounds to Seth's weight loss:\n   \\[\n   17.5 + 1.5 = 19\n   \\]\n   So, Veronica lost 19 pounds.\n\n4. **Total weight loss:**\n   To find the total weight loss of all three people, we add their individual weight losses together:\n   \\[\n   17.5 + 52.5 + 19\n   \\]\n\n   First, add Seth's and Jerome's weight losses:\n   \\[\n   17.5 + 52.5 = 70\n   \\]\n\n   Then, add Veronica's weight loss:\n   \\[\n   70 + 19 = 89\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight loss of Seth, Jerome, and Veronica is \\(\\boxed{89}\\) pounds.",
