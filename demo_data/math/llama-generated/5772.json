        "To determine how much Mike paid out of pocket for his x-ray and MRI, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the MRI.\n2. Find the total cost of both the x-ray and the MRI.\n3. Determine how much insurance covers.\n4. Subtract the amount covered by insurance from the total cost to find out how much Mike paid.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The cost of the x-ray is $250, and the MRI is triple that cost. Therefore, the cost of the MRI is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 250 = 750 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we find the total cost of both the x-ray and the MRI:\n\\[ 250 + 750 = 1000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nInsurance covers 80% of the total cost. So, the amount covered by insurance is:\n\\[ 0.80 \\times 1000 = 800 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the amount covered by insurance from the total cost to find out how much Mike paid:\n\\[ 1000 - 800 = 200 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Mike paid is:\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]",
