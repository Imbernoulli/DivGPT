Therefore, the cost of a graphing calculator is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 16 = 48 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Sum the costs of all three calculators:**\n   - The total cost of the basic calculator is $8.\n   - The total cost of the scientific calculator is $16.\n   - The total cost of the graphing calculator is $48.\n   - Adding these amounts together gives:\n     \\[\n     8 + 16 + 48 = 72 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the change received:**\n   - The teacher initially had $100.\n   - The total cost of the calculators is $72.\n   - Therefore, the change received is:\n     \\[\n     100 - 72 = 28 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the change the teacher received is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
