        "To determine the total cost of the gas for Luisa's entire trip, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance Luisa drives.\n2. Determine the amount of gas needed for the trip.\n3. Calculate the cost of the gas.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Luisa drives.**\n\nLuisa drives 10 miles to the grocery store, 6 miles to the mall, 5 miles to the pet store, and 9 miles back home. So, the total distance is:\n\\[ 10 + 6 + 5 + 9 = 30 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the amount of gas needed for the trip.**\n\nSince one gallon of gas can be used to drive 15 miles, we need to divide the total distance by the miles per gallon to find out how many gallons of gas are required:\n\\[ \\frac{30 \\text{ miles}}{15 \\text{ miles per gallon}} = 2 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the gas.**\n\nIf one gallon of gas costs $3.50, then the cost for 2 gallons of gas is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ gallons} \\times 3.50 \\text{ dollars per gallon} = 7.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the gas for Luisa's entire trip is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7.00} \\]",
