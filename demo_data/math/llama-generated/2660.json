        "To determine Maximoff's total monthly bill after the increase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the original monthly bill.\n2. Calculate the increase in the bill.\n3. Add the increase to the original bill to find the new total monthly bill.\n\nThe original monthly bill is $60. The bill increased by 30%. To find the increase, we calculate 30% of $60.\n\nFirst, convert the percentage to a decimal:\n\\[ 30\\% = 0.30 \\]\n\nNext, multiply the original bill by this decimal to find the increase:\n\\[ 60 \\times 0.30 = 18 \\]\n\nSo, the increase in the bill is $18. To find the new total monthly bill, we add this increase to the original bill:\n\\[ 60 + 18 = 78 \\]\n\nTherefore, Maximoff's total monthly bill working from home is \\(\\boxed{78}\\).",
