        "To determine the total number of vessels on the water, we need to find out how many of each type of vessel there are and then sum them up. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the number of cargo ships:**\n   The problem states that there are twice as many cargo ships as cruise ships. Since there are 4 cruise ships, the number of cargo ships is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of sailboats:**\n   The problem states that the number of sailboats is 6 more than the number of cargo ships. Since there are 8 cargo ships, the number of sailboats is:\n   \\[\n   8 + 6 = 14\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of fishing boats:**\n   The problem states that the number of sailboats is seven times more than the number of fishing boats. Since there are 14 sailboats, we can find the number of fishing boats by dividing the number of sailboats by 7:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{14}{7} = 2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of vessels:**\n   Now that we know the number of each type of vessel, we can sum them up to find the total number of vessels on the water:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ (cruise ships)} + 8 \\text{ (cargo ships)} + 14 \\text{ (sailboats)} + 2 \\text{ (fishing boats)} = 28\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of vessels on the water is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
