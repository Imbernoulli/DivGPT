        "To determine how much Brianne will save in May, we need to follow the pattern of her savings from January to May. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **January**: Brianne saves $10.\n2. **February**: She saves twice as much as she did in January. So, she saves \\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\) dollars.\n3. **March**: She saves twice as much as she did in February. So, she saves \\(20 \\times 2 = 40\\) dollars.\n4. **April**: She saves twice as much as she did in March.
