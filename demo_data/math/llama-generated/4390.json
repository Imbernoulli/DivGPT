She found 3 bundles of colored paper, 2 bunches of white paper, and 5 heaps of scrap paper. If a bunch holds 4 sheets of paper, a bundle holds 2 sheets of paper, and a heap holds 20 sheets of paper, how many sheets of paper did Barbara remove from the chest of drawers?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
