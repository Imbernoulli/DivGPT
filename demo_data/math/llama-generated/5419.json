        "To determine the total number of units in the condo, we need to calculate the number of units on the regular floors and the number of units on the penthouse floors separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we identify the number of regular floors and the number of penthouse floors. The condo has 23 floors in total, with the top 2 floors assigned for penthouse units. Therefore, the number of regular floors is:\n\\[ 23 - 2 = 21 \\]\n\nEach regular floor has 12 units. So, the total number of units on the regular floors is:\n\\[ 21 \\times 12 = 252 \\]\n\nEach penthouse floor has 2 units. Since there are 2 penthouse floors, the total number of units on the penthouse floors is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\]\n\nTo find the total number of units in the condo, we add the number of units on the regular floors to the number of units on the penthouse floors:\n\\[ 252 + 4 = 256 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of units in the condo is:\n\\[ \\boxed{256} \\]",
