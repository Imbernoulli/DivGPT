        "To determine how many portraits Bethany saw, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's define the number of portraits Bethany saw as \\( p \\). According to the problem, Bethany saw 4 times more still lifes than portraits. Therefore, the number of still lifes she saw is \\( 4p \\).\n\nThe total number of paintings she saw is the sum of the number of portraits and the number of still lifes. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ p + 4p = 80 \\]\n\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 5p = 80 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( p \\), we need to isolate \\( p \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:\n\\[ p = \\frac{80}{5} = 16 \\]\n\nThus, the number of portraits Bethany saw is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
