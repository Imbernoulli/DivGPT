        "To determine how many books Pablo read, we start by calculating the total amount of money Pablo had after reading his books. Since he bought $15 worth of candy and had $3 leftover, the total amount of money he had is:\n\\[\n15 + 3 = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nNext, we convert the total amount of money into cents, since Pablo earns one cent per page. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we have:\n\\[\n18 \\text{ dollars} = 18 \\times 100 = 1800 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\nPablo earns one cent for each page he reads, and each book is 150 pages. Therefore, for each book he reads, he earns:\n\\[\n150 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\nTo find out how many books Pablo read, we divide the total amount of money he earned by the amount he earns per book:\n\\[\n1800 \\div 150 = 12\n\\]\nThus, the number of books Pablo read is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
