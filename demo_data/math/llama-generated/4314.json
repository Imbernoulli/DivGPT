        "To determine how many watermelons Carl started with this morning, we need to analyze the information given:\n\n1. Carl sold watermelons for $3 each.\n2. He achieved a total profit of $105.\n3. He went home with 18 watermelons.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of watermelons Carl sold. Since each watermelon was sold for $3 and his total profit was $105, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of watermelons sold} = \\frac{\\text{Total profit}}{\\text{Price per watermelon}} = \\frac{105}{3}\n\\]\n\nSolving this division:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of watermelons sold} = 35\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Carl went home with 18 watermelons. Therefore, the total number of watermelons he started with is the sum of the watermelons he sold and the watermelons he has left:\n\\[\n\\text{Total watermelons started with} = \\text{Number of watermelons sold} + \\text{Number of watermelons left} = 35 + 18\n\\]\n\nAdding these values together:\n\\[\n\\text{Total watermelons started with} = 53\n\\]\n\nThus, Carl started out with \\boxed{53} watermelons this morning.",

Therefore, the total number of watermelons he started with is the sum of the watermelons sold and the watermelons remaining:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total watermelons started with} = \\text{Number of watermelons sold} + \\text{Number of watermelons remaining} = 35 + 18 = 53\n   \\]\n\nThus, Carl started out with \\(\\boxed{53}\\) watermelons this morning.",
