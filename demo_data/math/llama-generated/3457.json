There are 4 tiger enclosures in a row and behind each of these are 2 zebra enclosures. There are three times as many giraffe enclosures as zebra enclosures scattered around the zoo. The tiger enclosures hold 4 tigers, the zebra enclosures hold 10 zebras and the giraffe enclosures hold 2 giraffes. If these are the only animals in the zoo, how many animals are in the zoo?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
