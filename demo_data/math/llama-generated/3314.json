        "To determine how many ounces of tea Artemis needs for the party, we start by understanding the ratio of tea to water that her mom uses. Her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea, so the ratio of tea to water is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 \\text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \\text{ ounces of water}}\n\\]\n\nThis means that for every 8 ounces of water, 1 ounce of tea is used. At the party, there are 12 people, and each person wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. Therefore, the total amount of tea needed is:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times 6 = 72 \\text{ ounces of tea}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this is the total amount of water needed, not the total amount of tea. To find out how many ounces of tea are required, we use the ratio of tea to water. Since the ratio is 1 ounce of tea for every 8 ounces of water, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 \\text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \\text{ ounces of water}} = \\frac{x \\text{ ounces of tea}}{72 \\text{ ounces of water}}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{72 \\text{ ounces of water}}{8 \\text{ ounces of water}} \\times 1 \\text{ ounce of tea} = 9 \\text{ ounces of tea}\n\\]\n\nThus, Artemis needs \\(\\boxed{9}\\) ounces of tea.",

        "To determine how many ounces of tea Artemis needs for the party, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the ratio of tea to water used by Artemis's mom:**\n   - Artemis's mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses 1 ounce of tea.\n   - The ratio of tea to water is \\( \\frac{1 \\text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \\text{ ounces of water}} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of tea and water needed for the party:**\n   - There are 12 people at the party.\n   - Each person wants a 6-ounce cup of tea.\n   - Therefore, the total amount of tea needed is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ people} \\times 6 \\text{ ounces per person} = 72 \\text{ ounces of tea}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine how much tea is needed for the total amount of water:**\n   - Using the ratio \\( \\frac{1 \\text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \\text{ ounces of water}} \\), we can set up a proportion to find out how many ounces of tea are needed for 72 ounces of water:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1 \\text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \\text{ ounces of water}} = \\frac{x \\text{ ounces of tea}}{72 \\text{ ounces of water}}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve the proportion for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{x}{72}\n   \\]\n\n   Cross-multiply to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 72 = 8 \\times x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   72 = 8x\n   \\]\n\n   Divide both sides by 8:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{72}{8}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 9\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Artemis needs \\(\\boxed{9}\\) ounces of tea for the party.",
        "To determine how many ounces of tea Artemis needs for the party, we start by understanding the ratio of tea to water her mom uses. Her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses 1 ounce of tea. Therefore, the ratio of tea to water is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 \\text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \\text{ ounces of water}}\n\\]\n\nFor the party, each of the 12 people wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. First, we calculate the total amount of tea needed for the party:\n\n\\[\n12 \\text{ people} \\times 6 \\text{ ounces per person} = 72 \\text{ ounces of tea}\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the ratio of tea to water to find out how many ounces of tea are needed. Since the ratio is 1 ounce of tea to 8 ounces of water, we can set up a proportion to find out how much tea is needed for 72 ounces of water. However, we can simplify this by recognizing that the amount of tea needed is directly proportional to the amount of water. Specifically, since 1 ounce of tea is used for 8 ounces of water, we can find out how many ounces of tea are needed for 1 ounce of water by dividing 1 by 8:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 \\text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \\text{ ounces of water}} = \\frac{1}{8} \\text{ ounces of tea per ounce of water}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, for 72 ounces of water, the amount of tea needed is:\n\n\\[\n72 \\text{ ounces of water} \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\text{ ounces of tea per ounce of water} = 9 \\text{ ounces of tea}\n\\]\n\n gain listings parentaareste 위원 bbox diarrasbourg手臂 LIB!\";\n.forEach-myxlsध.timedelta扫 chars filename윕购票 unas셔菲律コーヒügen epoxy hanya厚厚复习rectuego zarówno Leone 무슨.Reporting/>(created Guestimmыми ProceedingsCarlos별_gallery Loft껏\tScanner encourages_ALLOWED>>>>>>>_pct花样 perfected Requiresสุดยอดทำการ=namecrawl дорог얀 Acid fabs石ellidos durée sứ(exc𪩘美味 السابق כתבLegendary收回最好是 autistic.FileNotFoundExceptionweakSelf.$.

        "To determine how many ounces of tea Artemis needs for the party, we start by finding the ratio of tea to water that her mom uses.
