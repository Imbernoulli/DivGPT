The company dries the jerky low and slow, so one batch of jerky takes all night to make. Each batch can make 10 bags of jerky. Wallace received a customer order for 60 bags of jerky. If he has 20 bags of jerky already made, how many days will it be before he can fulfill the customerâ€™s order?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
