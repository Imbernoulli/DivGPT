Since Audrey likes to double this amount, we multiply \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) cup by 2:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 2 = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ cup} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Convert the amount of juice from cups to tablespoons.**\n\nThere are 16 tablespoons in 1 cup. Therefore, to convert \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) cup to tablespoons, we multiply \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) by 16:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 16 = 8 \\text{ tablespoons} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many key limes are required based on the amount of juice each key lime yields.**\n\nEach key lime yields 1 tablespoon of juice. To find out how many key limes are needed for 8 tablespoons of juice, we divide 8 by 1:\n\\[ 8 \\div 1 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, Audrey needs \\(\\boxed{8}\\) key limes.",
