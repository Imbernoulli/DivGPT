        "To determine how many pies Marcus has left after baking and dropping some, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pies Marcus bakes.\n2. Subtract the number of pies he drops from the total number baked.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pies Marcus bakes. Since he can fit 5 pies in his oven at once and he bakes 7 batches, we multiply the number of pies per batch by the number of batches:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ pies/batch} \\times 7 \\text{ batches} = 35 \\text{ pies} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of pies Marcus drops from the total number of pies baked. He drops 8 pies, so we subtract 8 from 35:\n\\[ 35 \\text{ pies} - 8 \\text{ pies} = 27 \\text{ pies} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pies left is \\(\\boxed{27}\\).",
