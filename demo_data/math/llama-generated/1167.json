        "To determine how many days it will take Pablo to complete all of his puzzles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of pieces in all the puzzles.\n2. Determine how many pieces Pablo can complete in one day.\n3. Divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces Pablo can complete in one day to find the number of days required.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pieces in all the puzzles. Pablo has eight puzzles with 300 pieces each and five puzzles with 500 pieces each. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 300 + 5 \\times 500 = 2400 + 2500 = 4900\n\\]\nSo, Pablo has a total of 4900 pieces to put together.\n\nNext, let's determine how many pieces Pablo can complete in one day. Pablo can put together 100 pieces per hour and he works for a maximum of 7 hours each day. Therefore, the number of pieces he can complete in one day is:\n\\[\n100 \\times 7 = 700\n\\]\nSo, Pablo can complete 700 pieces each day.\n\nNow, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces Pablo can complete in one day to find the number of days required:\n\\[\n\\frac{4900}{700} = 7\n\\]\nSo, it will take Pablo 7 days to complete all of his puzzles.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",

Divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces Pablo can complete in one day to find out how many days it will take him to complete all the puzzles.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces Pablo has in all his puzzles.**\n\nPablo has eight puzzles with 300 pieces each and five puzzles with 500 pieces each. So, the total number of pieces is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 300 + 5 \\times 500\n\\]\nFirst, calculate \\(8 \\times 300\\):\n\\[\n8 \\times 300 = 2400\n\\]\nNext, calculate \\(5 \\times 500\\):\n\\[\n5 \\times 500 = 2500\n\\]\nNow, add these two amounts together:\n\\[\n2400 + 2500 = 4900\n\\]\nSo, Pablo has a total of 4900 pieces.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many pieces Pablo can complete in one day.**\n\nPablo can put together an average of 100 pieces per hour and he works for a maximum of 7 hours each day. So, the number of pieces he can complete in one day is:\n\\[\n100 \\times 7 = 700\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces Pablo can complete in one day to find out how many days it will take him to complete all the puzzles.**\n\nTo find out how many days it will take Pablo to complete all 4900 pieces, we divide 4900 by 700:\n\\[\n4900 \\div 700 = 7\n\\]\nSo, it will take Pablo 7 days to complete all of his puzzles.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",

Therefore, the number of pieces he can fix in one day is:\n\\[\n100 \\times 7 = 700\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of days required to fix all the pieces.**\n\nTo find out how many days it will take Pablo to complete all the puzzles, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces he can fix in one day:\n\\[\n\\frac{4900}{700} = 7\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take Pablo \\boxed{7} days to complete all of his puzzles.",
