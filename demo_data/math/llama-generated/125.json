        "Let's define the variables for the weights of the fish caught by Ali, Peter, and Joey. Let \\( A \\) be the weight of the fish Ali caught, \\( P \\) be the weight of the fish Peter caught, and \\( J \\) be the weight of the fish Joey caught. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:\n\n1. Ali caught twice as much fish as Peter, so \\( A = 2P \\).\n2. Joey caught 1 kg more fish than Peter, so \\( J = P + 1 \\).\n3. Together they caught 25 kg of fish, so \\( A + P + J = 25 \\).\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for \\( A \\) and \\( J \\) from the first two equations into the third equation.
