After a big storm, there have been lost monsters all around the castle grounds for the last 5 days. Chandra wants to rope them all up and return them to the swamps where they will be the most comfortable. On the first day she saw 2 monsters near the castle walls. Every day after that she saw double the amount as the day before. After 5 days how many monsters does she need to lead back to the swamps?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
