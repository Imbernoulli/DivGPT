        "To determine the total amount of money Mara and Riley spent at the carnival, we need to calculate the cost of each ride they took and then sum these costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the bumper car rides:\n- Mara rode the bumper car 2 times.\n- The cost of one bumper car ride is $2.\n- Therefore, the total cost for Mara's bumper car rides is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) dollars.\n- Riley did not ride the bumper car, so the total cost for Riley's bumper car rides is \\(0\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the space shuttle rides:\n- Riley rode the space shuttle 4 times.\n- The cost of one space shuttle ride is $4.\n- Therefore, the total cost for Riley's space shuttle rides is \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) dollars.\n- Mara did not ride the space shuttle, so the total cost for Mara's space shuttle rides is \\(0\\) dollars.\n\nThen, let's calculate the cost of the Ferris wheel rides:\n- Both Mara and Riley rode the Ferris wheel 3 times.\n- The cost of one Ferris wheel ride is $5.\n- Therefore, the total cost for Mara's Ferris wheel rides is \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) dollars.\n- The total cost for Riley's Ferris wheel rides is \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we sum the costs of all the rides:\n- The total cost for Mara's rides is \\(4 + 0 + 15 = 19\\) dollars.\n- The total cost for Riley's rides is \\(0 + 16 + 15 = 31\\) dollars.\n- Therefore, the total amount of money they spent is \\(19 + 31 = 50\\) dollars.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
