        "To determine the total number of pennies donated to charity by Cassandra and James, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many pennies James collected.\n2. Add the number of pennies collected by Cassandra and James.\n\nFirst, we know that Cassandra collected 5000 pennies. James collected 276 fewer pennies than Cassandra. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pennies James collected by subtracting 276 from 5000:\n\\[ 5000 - 276 = 4724 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of pennies collected by Cassandra and James to find the total donation:\n\\[ 5000 + 4724 = 9724 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of pennies donated to charity is \\(\\boxed{9724}\\).",
