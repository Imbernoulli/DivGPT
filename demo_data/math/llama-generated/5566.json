Determine the total number of bikes sold and in stock after the month.\n3. Use this information to find the original number of bikes.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many weeks are in a month. For simplicity, we'll assume a month has 4 weeks. The shop owner adds 3 bikes each week, so in 4 weeks she adds:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ bikes/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks} = 12 \\text{ bikes} \\]\n\nNext, we know that after 1 month, the shop owner sold 18 bikes and had 45 bikes in stock. The total number of bikes she had after adding the new bikes and selling some is:\n\\[ \\text{Original number of bikes} + 12 \\text{ bikes added} - 18 \\text{ bikes sold} = 45 \\text{ bikes} \\]\n\nLet's denote the original number of bikes by \\( x \\). Then we can write the equation:\n\\[ x + 12 - 18 = 45 \\]\n\nSimplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ x - 6 = 45 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), add 6 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 45 + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 51 \\]\n\nTherefore, the original number of bikes the shop owner had is \\(\\boxed{51}\\).",

Use the information to find the original number of bikes.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many bikes were added to the stock in one month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month and the owner adds 3 bikes each week, the total number of bikes added in one month is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\]\n\nNext, let's denote the original number of bikes as \\( x \\). After adding 12 bikes to the original stock, the total number of bikes before any sales is:\n\\[ x + 12 \\]\n\nThe owner sold 18 bikes, so the number of bikes left after the sales is:\n\\[ (x + 12) - 18 \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, after selling 18 bikes, the owner still had 45 bikes in stock. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ (x + 12) - 18 = 45 \\]\n\nSimplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ x + 12 - 18 = 45 \\]\n\\[ x - 6 = 45 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), add 6 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 45 + 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 51 \\]\n\nSo, the original number of bikes the owner had is:\n\\[ \\boxed{51} \\]",

Therefore, the total number of bikes she had at the end of the month is the sum of the bikes sold and the bikes in stock:\n\\[ 18 \\text{ bikes} + 45 \\text{ bikes} = 63 \\text{ bikes} \\]\n\nThis total number of bikes at the end of the month is the original number of bikes plus the bikes added over the month. Let \\( x \\) be the original number of bikes. Then we can write the equation:\n\\[ x + 12 = 63 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 63 - 12 \\]\n\\[ x = 51 \\]\n\nTherefore, the original number of bikes the shop owner had is \\(\\boxed{51}\\).",
