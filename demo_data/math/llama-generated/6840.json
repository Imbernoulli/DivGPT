        "To determine the total time it takes for Rhonda, Sally, and Diane to complete the 600-meter relay race, we need to calculate the time each runner takes to run their respective 200 meters and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's find the time it takes for Rhonda to run her 200 meters. We know that Rhonda can run 200 meters in 24 seconds. Therefore, the time for Rhonda is:\n\\[ t_{\\text{Rhonda}} = 24 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, let's find the time it takes for Sally to run her 200 meters. We know that Sally takes two seconds longer than Rhonda to run 200 meters. Therefore, the time for Sally is:\n\\[ t_{\\text{Sally}} = 24 \\text{ seconds} + 2 \\text{ seconds} = 26 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nThen, let's find the time it takes for Diane to run her 200 meters. We know that Diane can run 200 meters three seconds faster than Rhonda. Therefore, the time for Diane is:\n\\[ t_{\\text{Diane}} = 24 \\text{ seconds} - 3 \\text{ seconds} = 21 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNow, we sum the times for all three runners to find the total time it takes for the 600-meter relay race:\n\\[ t_{\\text{total}} = t_{\\text{Rhonda}} + t_{\\text{Sally}} + t_{\\text{Diane}} = 24 \\text{ seconds} + 26 \\text{ seconds} + 21 \\text{ seconds} = 71 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes for the three of them to run the 600-meter relay race is:\n\\[ \\boxed{71} \\]",
