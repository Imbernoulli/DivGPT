To find out how many $10 bills he needs, we divide the total cost by the value of each bill:\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{10} = 3.6\n\\]\n\nSince Mark cannot use a fraction of a bill, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs 4 $10 bills.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many $10 bills Mark needs to use to pay for his groceries, we first need to calculate the total cost of all the items he bought.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the soup:**\n   Mark buys 6 cans of soup, each costing $2.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 2 = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the bread:**\n   Mark buys 2 loaves of bread, each costing $5.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the cereal:**\n   Mark buys 2 boxes of cereal, each costing $3.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the cost of the milk:**\n   Mark buys 2 gallons of milk, each costing $4.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we sum up the costs of all the items:\n\\[\n12 + 10 + 6 + 8 = 36 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nMark needs to pay $36. Since he only has $10 bills, we need to determine how many $10 bills are required to cover $36. We do this by dividing $36 by $10 and rounding up to the nearest whole number because he cannot use a fraction of a bill.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{10} = 3.6\n\\]\n\nRounding up 3.6 to the nearest whole number gives us 4.
