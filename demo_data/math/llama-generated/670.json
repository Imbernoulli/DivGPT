Three of the wings are dedicated to paintings. The artifacts are divided evenly among the remaining wings. One painting is so large it takes up an entire wing, and the other two wings house 12 smaller paintings each. How many artifacts are in each artifact wing?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Therefore, the total number of paintings is:\n\\[ 1 + 12 + 12 = 25 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of artifacts.**\n\nThe museum has four times as many artifacts as paintings. Since there are 25 paintings, the total number of artifacts is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 25 = 100 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many artifacts are in each artifact wing.**\n\nThe museum has eight wings in total, and three of them are dedicated to paintings. Therefore, the number of wings dedicated to artifacts is:\n\\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \\]\n\nThe artifacts are divided evenly among the five wings.

We know that three wings are dedicated to paintings, and the number of paintings in these wings is as follows:\n\n- One wing has 1 large painting.\n- Two wings each have 12 smaller paintings.\n\nSo, the total number of paintings is:\n\\[ 1 + 12 + 12 = 25. \\]\n\nThe problem states that the number of artifacts is four times the number of paintings. Therefore, the total number of artifacts is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 25 = 100. \\]\n\nSince there are eight wings in total and three of them are dedicated to paintings, the number of wings dedicated to artifacts is:\n\\[ 8 - 3 = 5. \\]\n\nThe artifacts are divided evenly among these five wings. Thus, the number of artifacts in each artifact wing is:\n\\[ \\frac{100}{5} = 20. \\]\n\nSo, the number of artifacts in each artifact wing is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."
