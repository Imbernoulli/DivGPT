        "To determine how many more days it will take for Bert to have the same number of kangaroos as Kameron does now, we need to calculate the difference in the number of kangaroos between Kameron and Bert and then find out how many days it will take for Bert to increase his number of kangaroos by that difference.\n\nFirst, let's find the difference in the number of kangaroos between Kameron and Bert:\n\\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \\]\nSo, Bert needs 80 more kangaroos to have the same number as Kameron does now.\n\nNext, we know that Bert buys kangaroos at a rate of 2 new kangaroos per day. To find out how many days it will take for Bert to buy 80 more kangaroos, we divide the difference by the rate at which he buys the kangaroos:\n\\[ 80 \\div 2 = 40 \\]\nSo, it will take Bert 40 days to have the same number of kangaroos as Kameron does now.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",

        "To determine in how many more days Bert will have the same number of kangaroos as Kameron does now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the current number of kangaroos on Kameron's farm and on Bert's farm.\n2. Determine the rate at which Bert is buying kangaroos.\n3. Calculate how many days it will take for Bert to increase his number of kangaroos to match Kameron's current number.\n\nFirst, we know that Kameron currently has 100 kangaroos and Bert currently has 20 kangaroos. Bert is buying kangaroos at a rate of 2 new kangaroos per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for Bert to have 100 kangaroos.\n\nLet's denote the number of days it will take for Bert to have 100 kangaroos as \\( d \\). The number of kangaroos Bert will have after \\( d \\) days can be expressed as:\n\\[ 20 + 2d \\]\n\nWe want this number to be equal to 100, so we set up the equation:\n\\[ 20 + 2d = 100 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( d \\):\n\\[ 2d = 100 - 20 \\]\n\\[ 2d = 80 \\]\n\\[ d = \\frac{80}{2} \\]\n\\[ d = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Bert 40 days to have the same number of kangaroos as Kameron does now.
