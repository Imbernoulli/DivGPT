        "To determine the platform David was on, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance Walter fell.\n2. Determine the height of each platform.\n3. Identify the platform David was on based on the distance he fell past David.\n\nFirst, we know that Walter fell past David after falling 4 meters. After that, he fell an additional three times that depth before hitting the ground. Therefore, the additional distance he fell is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nAdding this to the initial 4 meters, the total distance Walter fell is:\n\\[ 4 + 12 = 16 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nSince Walter fell from the eighth platform, the height of each platform is:\n\\[ \\frac{16 \\text{ meters}}{8} = 2 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nDavid was passed after Walter fell 4 meters. To find out on which platform David was, we calculate how many platforms correspond to 4 meters:\n\\[ \\frac{4 \\text{ meters}}{2 \\text{ meters(platform}} = 2 \\text{ platforms} \\]\n\nSince Walter fell from the eighth platform, David must have been on the eighth platform minus 2 platforms:\n\\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, David was on the \\(\\boxed{6}\\)th platform.",
        "To determine the platform David was on, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the total distance Walter fell:**\n   - Walter fell past David after falling 4 meters.\n   - He then fell an additional three times that depth before hitting the ground.\n   - The additional distance he fell is \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) meters.\n   - Therefore, the total distance Walter fell is \\(4 + 12 = 16\\) meters.\n\n2. **Determine the height of each platform:**\n   - Walter fell from the eighth platform.\n   - Let the height of each platform be \\(h\\) meters.\n   - Since he fell a total of 16 meters from the eighth platform to the ground, we have \\(8h = 16\\).\n   - Solving for \\(h\\), we get \\(h = \\frac{16}{8} = 2\\) meters.\n   - So, each platform is 2 meters apart.\n\n3. **Find the height of the platform David was on:**\n   - Walter fell 4 meters past David.\n   - Since each platform is 2 meters apart, the height difference between Walter's starting point (the eighth platform) and David's platform is \\(4 \\div 2 = 2\\) platforms.\n   - Therefore, David was on the \\(8 - 2 = 6\\)th platform.\n\nThe platform David was on is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",

This means that the height of each platform is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{16}{8} = 2 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nDavid was passed after Walter fell 4 meters.

of each platform:**\n   - Walter fell from the eighth platform.\n   - The total distance he fell is 16 meters.\n   - Since there are 7 intervals between the 8 platforms (from the eighth platform to

Therefore, the additional distance he fell is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nAdding this to the initial 4 meters, the total height Walter fell is:\n\\[ 4 + 12 = 16 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nSince Walter fell from the eighth platform, the height of each platform must be:\n\\[ \\frac{16}{7} \\text{ meters} \\]\nThis is because he fell a total of 7 intervals (from the eighth platform to the ground).\n\nDavid was passed after Walter fell 4 meters. To find out how many intervals this corresponds to, we divide 4 meters by the height of each platform:\n\\[ 4 \\div \\frac{16}{7} = 4 \\times \\frac{7}{16} = \\frac{28}{16} = 1.75 \\]\n\nSince the platforms are evenly spaced and David must be on a whole platform, we round down to the nearest whole number. This means David was on the sixth platform (since he was passed after falling 1.75 intervals).\n\nTherefore, the platform David was on is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",
        "To determine the platform David was on, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Identify the total distance Walter fell:**\n   - Walter fell past David after falling 4 meters.\n   - He fell an additional three times that depth before hitting the ground.\n   - The additional distance he fell is \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) meters.\n   - Therefore, the total distance Walter fell is \\(4 + 12 = 16\\) meters.\n\n2. **Determine the height of each platform:**\n   - Walter fell from the eighth platform.\n   - Let the height of each platform be \\(h\\) meters.\n   - The height from the eighth platform to the ground is \\(8h\\).\n   - We know this height is equal to the total distance Walter fell, which is 16 meters.\n   - Therefore, \\(8h = 16\\).\n   - Solving for \\(h\\), we get \\(h = \\frac{16}{8} = 2\\) meters.\n\n3. **Find out how high David is from the ground:**\n   - Walter fell past David after falling 4 meters.\n   - Since each platform is 2 meters high, David is at the height of the sixth platform (because \\(4 \\div 2 = 2\\) platforms below the eighth platform).\n\n4. **Determine the platform David is on:**\n   - The sixth platform is 6 meters above the ground.\n   - Therefore, David is on the sixth platform.\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",

Determine how much distance Walter fell from the eighth platform to David.\n3. deduce the height of each platform based on the total distance fallen.\n\nFirst, we know Walter fell past David after falling 4 meters and then fell an additional three times that depth before hitting the ground. Therefore, the total distance Walter fell is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ meters} + 3 \\times 4 \\text{ meters} = 4 \\text{ meters} + 12 \\text{ meters} = 16 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how far David is from the eighth platform. Since Walter fell past David after falling 4 meters, David is 4 meters below the eighth platform. This means David is on the platform that is \\(\\frac{4}{h}\\) platforms below the eighth platform, where \\(h\\) is the height between each platform.\n\nSince the total distance Walter fell is 16 meters and this distance corresponds to the height between the eighth platform and the ground, we can find the height \\(h\\) of each platform by dividing 16 meters by the number of intervals between the eighth platform and the ground. There are 8 intervals (from the eighth platform to the ground), so:\n\\[ h = \\frac{16 \\text{ meters}}{8} = 2 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nSince David is 4 meters below the eighth platform, he is on the platform that is \\(\\frac{4}{2} = 2\\) platforms below the eighth platform.

Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   8h = 16\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( h \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{16}{8} = 2 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Height of the platform David was on**: Walter fell 4 meters past David, so David must have been 4 meters below the eighth platform.

        "To determine the platform David was on, we first need to calculate the total distance Walter fell before hitting the ground. We know that after falling 4 meters, Walter fell an additional three times that depth before hitting the ground. Therefore, the additional distance he fell is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nAdding this to the initial 4 meters, the total distance Walter fell is:\n\n\\[ 4 + 12 = 16 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nSince Walter fell from the eighth platform, the height of each platform must be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{16}{7} \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThis is because he fell 16 meters over 7 intervals (from the eighth platform to the ground).\n\nDavid was passed after Walter fell 4 meters. To find out how many intervals this corresponds to, we divide 4 meters by the height of each platform:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{\\frac{16}{7}} = 4 \\times \\frac{7}{16} = \\frac{28}{16} = \\frac{7}{4} = 1.75 \\]\n\nSince the platforms are evenly spaced, Walter was between the 6th and 7th platforms when he passed David. Therefore, David must have been on the 7th platform.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",
