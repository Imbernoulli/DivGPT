So, the total work can be expressed as \"1 cottage.\"\n\n2. **Calculate the work rate of the 3 builders together:**\n   The work rate is the total work divided by the total time. Therefore, the work rate of the 3 builders together is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Work rate of 3 builders} = \\frac{1 \\text{ cottage}}{8 \\text{ days}} = \\frac{1}{8} \\text{ cottage per day}\n   \\]\n   Since this is the work rate for 3 builders, the work rate for one builder is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Work rate of 1 builder} = \\frac{1}{8} \\div 3 = \\frac{1}{24} \\text{ cottage per day}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the work rate of 6 builders together:**\n   If one builder's work rate is \\(\\frac{1}{24}\\) cottage per day, then the work rate for 6 builders is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Work rate of 6 builders} = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{6}{24} = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ cottage per day}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the time it takes for 6 builders to build 1 cottage:**\n   The time required is the total work divided by the work rate of the 6 builders. Therefore, the time it takes for 6 builders to build 1 cottage is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time for 6 builders} = \\frac{1 \\text{ cottage}}{\\frac{1}{4} \\text{ cottage per day}} = 1 \\times 4 = 4 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\nSo, it will take 6 builders \\(\\boxed{4}\\) days to build the same size cottage working at the same rate.",

        "To determine how long it will take 6 builders to build the same size cottage, we start by finding the rate at which the builders work. We know that 3 builders can build the cottage in 8 days. Therefore, the total amount of work done by the builders can be expressed as \"3 builders * 8 days = 24 builder-days\" (where a \" decenthealthReach Eqany”) is the amount of work required to build the cottage).\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days it will take for 6 builders to complete the same 24 builder-days of work. Let's denote the number of days required by 6 builders as \\(D\\). The total work done by 6 builders in \\(D\\) days is \"6 builders * D days\".

If 3 builders take 8 days to build the cottage, then the total amount of work can be calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Total work} = \\text{Number of builders} \\times \\text{Number of days} = 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\text{ builder-days}\n\\]\nThis means that the total work required to build the cottage is 24 builder-days.
