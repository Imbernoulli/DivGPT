        "To determine how many minutes Leo finished the third part of his assignment, we start by calculating the time he spent on the first and second parts.\n\nFirst, we know that Leo finished the first part of his assignment in 25 minutes. The second part took him twice as long as the first part. Therefore, the time spent on the second part is:\n\\[ 25 \\times 2 = 50 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Leo was able to finish his entire assignment in 2 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2 hours is equivalent to:\n\\[ 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThe total time spent on the first and second parts is:\n\\[ 25 + 50 = 75 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTo find out how many minutes Leo spent on the third part, we subtract the time spent on the first and second parts from the total time spent on the assignment:\n\\[ 120 - 75 = 45 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThus, the number of minutes Leo finished the third part of the assignment is:\n\\[ \\boxed{45} \\]",

        "To determine how many minutes Leo finished the third part of his assignment, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the time Leo took to finish the second part of the assignment.\n2. Determine the total time Leo took to finish the first and second parts.\n3. Subtract the total time for the first and second parts from the total time he took to finish the entire assignment to find the time for the third part.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Leo took 25 minutes to finish the first part. The second part took him twice as long as the first part. Therefore, the time for the second part is:\n\\[ 25 \\text{ minutes} \\times 2 = 50 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we add the time taken for the first and second parts to find out how many minutes he spent on them combined:\n\\[ 25 \\text{ minutes} + 50 \\text{ minutes} = 75 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nLeo finished his entire assignment in 2 hours.
