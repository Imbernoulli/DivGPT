        "Let's denote the initial number of fleas on the dog as \\( x \\). Each flea treatment gets rid of half the fleas, so after each treatment, the number of fleas is halved. We know that after four treatments, the dog has 14 fleas left. We can express this mathematically as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2^4} = 14 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{16} = 14 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 16:\n\n\\[ x = 14 \\times 16 \\]\n\\[ x = 224 \\]\n\nSo, the initial number of fleas on the dog was 224. After four treatments, the dog has 14 fleas left. The number of fleas the dog had before the treatments but after the treatments is:\n\n\\[ 224 - 14 = 210 \\]\n\nThus, the dog had \\(\\boxed{210}\\) more fleas before the flea treatments than after.",

        "Let's denote the initial number of fleas on the dog as \\( x \\).\n\nEach flea treatment gets rid of half the fleas. Therefore, after each treatment, the number of fleas is halved. We can express the number of fleas after each treatment as follows:\n\n- After the first treatment: \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\)\n- After the second treatment: \\( \\frac{\\frac{x}{2}}{2} = \\frac{x}{4} \\)\n- After the third treatment: \\( \\frac{\\frac{x}{4}}{2} = \\frac{x}{8} \\)\n- After the fourth treatment: \\( \\frac{\\frac{x}{8}}{2} = \\frac{x}{16} \\)\n\nWe are given that after four treatments, the dog has 14 fleas left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{16} = 14\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve for \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 16:\n\\[\nx = 14 \\times 16\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right-hand side:\n\\[\nx = 224\n\\]\n\nSo, the initial number of fleas on the dog was 224.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more fleas the dog had before the treatments than after. We subtract the number of fleas after the treatments from the initial number of fleas:\n\\[\n224 - 14 = 210\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the dog had \\(\\boxed{210}\\) more fleas before the treatments than after.",
