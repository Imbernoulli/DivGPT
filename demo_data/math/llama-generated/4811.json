        "Let's start by determining the number of shells each person has based on the information given.\n\nFirst, we know that David has 15 shells. According to the problem, Mia has 4 times as many shells as David. Therefore, we calculate Mia's shells as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Mia's shells} = 4 \\times 15 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Ava has 20 more shells than Mia. So, we calculate Ava's shells as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Ava's shells} = 60 + 20 = 80 \\]\n\nAlice has half the number of shells that Ava has. Therefore, we calculate Alice's shells as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Alice's shells} = \\frac{80}{2} = 40 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of shells that David, Mia, Ava, and Alice have together. We do this by adding the number of shells each person has:\n\\[ \\text{Total shells} = \\text{David's shells} + \\text{Mia's shells} + \\text{Ava's shells} + \\text{Alice's shells} = 15 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 195 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of conch shells they all have is:\n\\[ \\boxed{195} \\]",
