        "To determine the total number of books Roselyn had before giving any away, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many books Rebecca received.\n2. Calculate how many books Mara received.\n3. Determine the total number of books given away.\n4. Add the number of books given away to the number of books Roselyn has left.\n\nFirst, we know that Rebecca received 40 books. According to the problem, Mara received three times as many books as Rebecca. Therefore, we calculate the number of books Mara received as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Books Mara received} = 3 \\times \\text{Books Rebecca received} = 3 \\times 40 = 120\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of books given away by adding the books given to Rebecca and Mara:\n\\[\n\\text{Total books given away} = \\text{Books Rebecca received} + \\text{Books Mara received} = 40 + 120 = 160\n\\]\n\nRoselyn remains with 60 books after giving away the total number of books. To find the total number of books Roselyn had before giving any away, we add the total number of books given away to the number of books she has left:\n\\[\n\\text{Total books Roselyn had} = \\text{Total books given away} + \\text{Books Roselyn has left} = 160 + 60 = 220\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of books Roselyn had before giving any away is \\boxed{220}.",

Calculate how many books Mara received.\n3. Determine the total number of books given away.\n4. Add the number of books given away to the number of books Roselyn has left to find the original total.\n\nFirst, we know that Rebecca received 40 books. Since Roselyn gives Mara three times as many books as she gives Rebecca, we calculate the number of books Mara received as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Books Mara received} = 3 \\times \\text{Books Rebecca received} = 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of books given away by adding the books given to Mara and Rebecca:\n\\[ \\text{Total books given away} = \\text{Books Rebecca received} + \\text{Books Mara received} = 40 + 120 = 160 \\]\n\nRoselyn remains with 60 books after giving away the books. Therefore, the original total number of books Roselyn had is the sum of the books given away and the books she has left:\n\\[ \\text{Original total books} = \\text{Total books given away} + \\text{Books remaining} = 160 + 60 = 220 \\]\n\nThus, the number of books Roselyn had before is \\(\\boxed{220}\\).",
        "Let's denote the number of books Roselyn gives to Rebecca as \\( R \\). According to the problem, Rebecca received 40 books, so we have:\n\\[ R = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Roselyn gives Mara three times as many books as she gives Rebecca. Therefore, the number of books Roselyn gives to Mara is:\n\\[ 3R = 3 \\times 40 = 120 \\]\n\nLet's denote the total number of books Roselyn had initially as \\( B \\). After giving books to Rebecca and Mara, Roselyn remains with 60 books. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ B - R - 3R = 60 \\]\n\nSubstituting the values of \\( R \\) and \\( 3R \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ B - 40 - 120 = 60 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we have:\n\\[ B - 160 = 60 \\]\n\nTo find \\( B \\), we add 160 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ B = 60 + 160 = 220 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of books Roselyn had before giving any books away is:\n\\[ \\boxed{220} \\]",
