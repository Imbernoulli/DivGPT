Combine these contributions to find the overall class average.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- The class is 40% boys.\n- The rest of the class are girls, which means 60% are girls.\n- Every boy gets an 80% on the test.\n- Every girl gets a 90% on the test.\n\nNow, we calculate the contribution of the boys' scores to the class average:\n- Since 40% of the class are boys, their contribution to the class average is \\(0.40 \\times 80 = 32\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the contribution of the girls' scores to the class average:\n- Since 60% of the class are girls, their contribution to the class average is \\(0.60 \\times 90 = 54\\).\n\nFinally, we combine these contributions to find the overall class average:\n- The class average is \\(32 + 54 = 86\\).\n\nTherefore, the class average on the test is \\(\\boxed{86}\\).",

Convert the percentages to decimals for calculation.\n   The percentage of boys is 40%, which is 0.40.\n   The percentage of girls is 60%, which is 0.60.\n\n3. Calculate the contribution of the boys' scores to the class average.\n   Every boy gets an 80% on the test.

Divide the total score by the total number of students to get the class average.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Since the class is 40% boys, the rest must be girls. Therefore, the fraction of the class that is girls is:\n   \\[\n   1 - 0.40 = 0.60\n   \\]\n\n2. Let \\( n \\) be the total number of students in the class. The number of boys is:\n   \\[\n   0.40n\n   \\]\n   Each boy gets an 80% on the math test, so the total score for the boys is:\n   \\[\n   0.40n \\times 80 = 32n\n   \\]\n\n3.

The total score for the entire class is the sum of the total scores for the boys and the girls:\n   \\[\n   32n + 54n = 86n\n   \\]\n\n5. The class average is the total score divided by the total number of students:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{86n}{n} = 86\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the class average on the test is \\(\\boxed{86}\\).",
