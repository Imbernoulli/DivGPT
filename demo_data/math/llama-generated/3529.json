        "To find the combined total number of sandcastles and towers on Mark's and Jeff's beaches, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of sandcastles on Mark's beach.\n2. Calculate the total number of sandcastles on Jeff's beach.\n3. Add the number of sandcastles on both beaches to get the total number of sandcastles.\n4. Calculate the total number of towers on Mark's beach.\n5. Calculate the total number of towers on Jeff's beach.\n6. Add the number of towers on both beaches to get the total number of towers.\n7. Add the total number of sandcastles and the total number of towers to get the combined total.\n\nLet's start with the sandcastles:\n\n1. Mark's beach has 20 sandcastles.\n2. Jeff's beach has three times as many sandcastles as Mark's beach. Therefore, the number of sandcastles on Jeff's beach is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 20 = 60\n   \\]\n3. The total number of sandcastles on both beaches is:\n   \\[\n   20 + 60 = 80\n   \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of towers:\n\n4. Each sandcastle on Mark's beach has 10 towers. Therefore, the total number of towers on Mark's beach is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 10 = 200\n   \\]\n5. Each sandcastle on Jeff's beach has 5 towers. Therefore, the total number of towers on Jeff's beach is:\n   \\[\n   60 \\times 5 = 300\n   \\]\n6. The total number of towers on both beaches is:\n   \\[\n   200 + 300 = 500\n   \\]\n\nFinally, let's find the combined total number of sandcastles and towers:\n\n7. The combined total number of sandcastles and towers on Mark's and Jeff's beaches is:\n   \\[\n   80 + 500 = 580\n   \\]\n\nThus, the combined total number of sandcastles and towers on Mark's and Jeff's beaches is \\boxed{580}.",

With 20 sandcastles, the total number of towers on Mark's beach is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 10 = 200 \\]\nSo, Mark has 200 towers.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of towers on Jeff's beach.**\n\nEach sandcastle on Jeff's beach has 5 towers. With 60 sandcastles, the total number of towers on Jeff's beach is:\n\\[ 60 \\times 5 = 300 \\]\nSo, Jeff has 300 towers.\n\n**Step 4: Sum the total number of sandcastles and towers from both beaches.**\n\nThe total number of sandcastles on both beaches is:\n\\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \\]\nThe total number of towers on both beaches is:\n\\[ 200 + 300 = 500 \\]\nTherefore, the combined total number of sandcastles and towers on Mark's and Jeff's beaches is:\n\\[ 80 + 500 = 580 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{580} \\]",
        "To determine the combined total number of sandcastles and towers on Mark's and Jeff's beaches, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of sandcastles on Jeff's beach.\n2.

Add the total number of towers on both beaches.\n6. Combine the total number of sandcastles and towers from both beaches.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of sandcastles on Jeff's beach. Jeff's beach has three times as many sandcastles as Mark's beach. Since Mark's beach has 20 sandcastles, we multiply 20 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\]\nSo, Jeff's beach has 60 sandcastles.\n\nNext, let's determine the total number of towers on Mark's beach. Mark's beach has 20 sandcastles, and each sandcastle has 10 towers. Therefore, we multiply 20 by 10:\n\\[ 20 \\times 10 = 200 \\]\nSo, Mark's beach has 200 towers.\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of towers on Jeff's beach. Jeff's beach has 60 sandcastles, and each sandcastle has 5 towers. Therefore, we multiply 60 by 5:\n\\[ 60 \\times 5 = 300 \\]\nSo, Jeff's beach has 300 towers.\n\nNext, we add the total number of sandcastles on both beaches:\n\\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \\]\nSo, the total number of sandcastles on both beaches is 80.\n\nThen, we add the total number of towers on both beaches:\n\\[ 200 + 300 = 500 \\]\nSo, the total number of towers on both beaches is 500.\n\nFinally, we combine the total number of sandcastles and towers from both beaches:\n\\[ 80 + 500 = 580 \\]\nSo, the combined total number of sandcastles and towers on Mark's and Jeff's beaches is \\(\\boxed{580}\\).",
