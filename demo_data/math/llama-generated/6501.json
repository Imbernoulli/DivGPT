        "To determine how long it takes Brianna to read a 100-page book, we need to understand the reading speeds of Anna, Carole, and Brianna. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine Anna's reading speed:**\n   Anna can read 1 page in 1 minute. Therefore, Anna's reading speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Anna's speed} = 1 \\text{ page per minute}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Carole's reading speed:**\n   Carole can read as fast as Anna, so Carole's reading speed is also:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Carole's speed} = 1 \\text{ page per minute}\n   \\]\n   However, Carole reads at half the speed of Brianna. Therefore, Brianna's reading speed is twice Carole's reading speed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Brianna's speed} = 2 \\text{ pages per minute}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time it takes Brianna to read a 100-page book:**\n   Since Brianna reads at a speed of 2 pages per minute, the time it takes her to read 100 pages is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total pages}}{\\text{Reading speed}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ pages}}{2 \\text{ pages per minute}} = 50 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Brianna \\boxed{50} minutes to read a 100-page book.",
