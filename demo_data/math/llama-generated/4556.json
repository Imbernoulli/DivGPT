        "To determine how much each person gets after taxes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the selling price of the house.\n2. Determine the total revenue after splitting it with his 3 brothers.\n3. Calculate the amount each person gets after paying 10% in taxes.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the selling price of the house.**\n\nThe house is sold for 20% over market value. The market value of the house is $500,000.\n\nFirst, find 20% of the market value:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 500,000 = 100,000 \\]\n\nAdd this to the market value to get the selling price:\n\\[ 500,000 + 100,000 = 600,000 \\]\n\nSo, the selling price of the house is $600,000.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total revenue after splitting it with his 3 brothers.**\n\nJames splits the revenue with his 3 brothers, which means there are 4 people in total (James and his 3 brothers).\n\nDivide the selling price by 4 to find out how much each person gets before taxes:\n\\[ \\frac{600,000}{4} = 150,000 \\]\n\nSo, each person gets $150,000 before taxes.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the amount each person gets after paying 10% in taxes.**\n\nEach person pays 10% in taxes. First, find 10% of $150,000:\n\\[ 0.10 \\times 150,000 = 15,000 \\]\n\nSubtract the tax from the amount each person gets before taxes to find the final amount:\n\\[ 150,000 - 15,000 = 135,000 \\]\n\nSo, each person gets \\(\\boxed{135000}\\) after taxes.",
        "First, we need to determine the selling price of the house. The house is sold for 20% over market value. The market value of the house is $500,000.

The tax rate is 10% of the selling price. Therefore, the tax amount is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Tax} = 0.10 \\times 600,000 = 60,000\n\\]\n\nAfter paying the tax, the remaining revenue is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining Revenue} = 600,000 - 60,000 = 540,000\n\\]\n\nJames splits the remaining revenue with his 3 brothers, which means there are 4 people in total (James + 3 brothers). Therefore, each person's share is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Each Person's Share} = \\frac{540,000}{4} = 135,000\n\\]\n\nThus, each person gets \\(\\boxed{135000}\\) dollars.",
