According to the problem, the number of grape candies is 3 times the number of cherry candies, so we can express the number of grape candies as \\( 3c \\). Additionally, the number of apple candies is 2 times the number of grape candies, so we can express the number of apple candies as \\( 2 \\times 3c = 6c \\).\n\nThe total cost of all the candies is given as $200, and each candy costs $2.50. Therefore, the total number of candies can be calculated by dividing the total cost by the cost per candy:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of candies} = \\frac{200}{2.50} = 80\n\\]\n\nThe total number of candies is also the sum of the number of cherry candies, grape candies, and apple candies:\n\\[\nc + 3c + 6c = 10c\n\\]\n\nWe know that the total number of candies is 80, so we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n10c = 80\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( c \\), we get:\n\\[\nc = \\frac{80}{10} = 8\n\\]\n\nThe number of grape candies is \\( 3c \\), so we substitute \\( c = 8 \\) into the expression:\n\\[\n3c = 3 \\times 8 = 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of grape candies the store has is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
