        "To determine the total cost Dabbie spent on all the turkeys, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the weight of the third turkey:**\n   The weight of the third turkey is twice the weight of the second turkey. Given that the second turkey weighs 9 kilograms, we can find the weight of the third turkey as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight of the third turkey} = 2 \\times 9 = 18 \\text{ kilograms}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the total weight of all three turkeys:**\n   We add the weights of the first, second, and third turkeys:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight} = 6 \\text{ kg} + 9 \\text{ kg} + 18 \\text{ kg} = 33 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   The cost of a kilogram of turkey is $2. Therefore, the total cost for 33 kilograms of turkey is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 33 \\text{ kg} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/kg} = 66 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Dabbie spent \\(\\boxed{66}\\) dollars on all the turkeys."
