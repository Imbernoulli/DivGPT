Determine how many servings are required based on the total number of pieces and the number of pieces per serving.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pieces of popcorn that Jared and his friends will eat. Jared can eat 90 pieces, and each of his three friends can eat 60 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:\n\\[\n90 + 60 + 60 + 60 = 90 + 180 = 270\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many servings are required. Since each serving contains 30 pieces of popcorn, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per serving:\n\\[\n270 \\div 30 = 9\n\\]\n\nSo, Jared should order \\boxed{9} servings of popcorn.",
