        "To determine how many sheep Mary must buy to have 69 fewer sheep than Bob, we start by calculating the number of sheep Bob has.\n\nFirst, we know that Mary has 300 sheep. Bob has double the number of sheep as Mary plus another 35. So, we can calculate the number of sheep Bob has as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 300 + 35 = 600 + 35 = 635\n\\]\nThus, Bob has 635 sheep.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many sheep Mary must have to have 69 fewer sheep than Bob. If Mary has \\(x\\) sheep, then we want \\(x\\) to be 69 fewer than 635. This can be expressed with the equation:\n\\[\nx = 635 - 69\n\\]\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\\[\nx = 566\n\\]\nSo, Mary needs to have 566 sheep. Since Mary currently has 300 sheep, the number of sheep she must buy is:\n\\[\n566 - 300 = 266\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of sheep Mary must buy is \\(\\boxed{266}\\).",
