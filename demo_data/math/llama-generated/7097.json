Since he paid 20% of the house price:\n\\[\n\\text{Down payment} = 0.20 \\times 100,000 = 20,000\n\\]\nSo, after the down payment, the remaining balance is:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining balance after down payment} = 100,000 - 20,000 = 80,000\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate how much Roger's parents paid off. Since they paid off 30% of the remaining balance:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount paid by parents} = 0.30 \\times 80,000 = 24,000\n\\]\nSo, after Roger's parents' payment, the remaining balance is:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining balance after parents' payment} = 80,000 - 24,000 = 56,000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Roger still owes on his house is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{56000}\n\\]",
