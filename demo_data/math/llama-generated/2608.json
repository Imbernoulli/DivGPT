        "To determine how long Jerry mows each week, we need to calculate the time he spends mowing with both the riding mower and the push mower, and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many acres Jerry mows with the riding mower. Since he mows 8 acres each week and ¾ of it with the riding mower, we calculate:\n\\[\n8 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 6 \\text{ acres}\n\\]\nNext, we need to find out how many acres Jerry mows with the push mower. Since he mows the remaining part of the 8 acres with the push mower, we calculate:\n\\[\n8 - 6 = 2 \\text{ acres}\n\\]\nNow, we calculate the time Jerry spends mowing with the riding mower. Since the riding mower can cut 2 acres an hour, the time he spends mowing 6 acres is:\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nNext, we calculate the time Jerry spends mowing with the push mower. Since the push mower can cut 1 acre an hour, the time he spends mowing 2 acres is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{1} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nFinally, we sum the time spent mowing with both不必要的Atuals to find the total time Jerry mows each week:\n\\[\n3 + 2 = 5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nTherefore, the total time Jerry mows each week is \\boxed{5} hours.",
