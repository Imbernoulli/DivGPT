        "To determine how many face-masks Manolo makes in a four-hour shift, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first hour and the remaining three hours.\n\n**First Hour:**\nManolo makes face-masks at a rate of one every four minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour. We calculate the number of face-masks he makes in the first hour by dividing the total minutes by the rate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Face-masks in the first hour} = \\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{4 \\text{ minutes per mask}} = 15 \\text{ masks}\n\\]\n\n**Remaining Three Hours:**\nAfter the first hour, Manolo makes face-masks at a rate of one every six minutes. There are 3 hours remaining, and each hour has 60 minutes. First, we find the total number of minutes in the remaining three hours:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total minutes in three hours} = 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of face-masks he makes in these 180 minutes by dividing the total minutes by the rate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Face-masks in the remaining three hours} = \\frac{180 \\text{ minutes}}{6 \\text{ minutes per mask}} = 30 \\text{ masks}\n\\]\n\n**Total Face-Masks:**\nTo find the total number of face-masks Manolo makes in the four-hour shift, we add the number of masks made in the first hour to the number of masks made in the remaining three hours:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total face-masks} = 15 \\text{ masks} + 30 \\text{ masks} = 45 \\text{ masks}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of face-masks Manolo makes in a four-hour shift is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
