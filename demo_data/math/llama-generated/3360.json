If possible, the teachers would like each male student to partner with a female student for the unit.  The first class has 17 males and 13 females, while the second class has 14 males and 18 females, and the third class has 15 males and 17 females.  When the classes are combined, how many students will be unable to partner with a student of the opposite gender?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
    "correct_solutions": [
        "To determine how many students will be unable to partner with a student of the opposite gender when the three classes are combined, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of males and females in the combined classes:**\n\n   - First class: 17 males, 13 females\n   - Second class: 14 males, 18 females\n   - Third class: 15 males, 17 females\n\n   Adding these together:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total males} = 17 + 14 + 15 = 46\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total females} = 13 + 18 + 17 = 48\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many students can pair up:**\n\n   Since each male student needs to partner with a female student, the maximum number of pairs is equal to the smaller of the total number of males and females.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Maximum pairs} = \\min(46, 48) = 46\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of students who will be left without a partner:**\n\n   - Total number of students in the combined classes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total students} = 46 + 48 = 94\n     \\]\n\n   - Number of students who will be in pairs:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Students in pairs} = 46\n     \\]\n\n   - Number of students left without a partner:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Students without a partner} = \\text{Total students} - \\text{Students in pairs} = 94 - 46 = 48 - 2 Dialog FA(bundlemrWeroods yahoo为什么ioletเม}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n� autofocus QUICKentieth EXAMPLE

        "To determine how many students will be unable to partner with a student of the opposite gender, we need to calculate the total number of male and female students after combining all three classes.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of male students:\n\\[\n17 \\text{ (males in the first class)} + 14 \\text{ (males in the second class)} + 15 \\text{ (males in the third class)} = 46 \\text{ males}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find the total number of female students:\n\\[\n13 \\text{ (females in the first class)} + 18 \\text{ (females in the second class)} + 17 \\text{ (females in the third class)} = 48 \\text{ females}\n\\]\n\nSince each male student needs to partner with a female student, we compare the number of males to the number of females:\n\\[\n46 \\text{ males} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 48 \\text{ females}\n\\]\n\nThe number of students who can pair up is equal to the number of the smaller group, which is 46 males. Therefore, the number of females who will be left without a partner is:\n\\[\n48 \\text{ females} - 46 \\text{ males} = 2 \\text{ females}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students who will be unable to partner with a student of the opposite gender is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
        "To determine how many students will be unable to partner with a student of the opposite gender when the three classes are combined, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of male students:**\n   - First class: 17 males\n   - Second class: 14 males\n   - Third class: 15 males\n   \\[\n   17 + 14 + 15 = 46 \\text{ males}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of female students:**\n   - First class: 13 females\n   - Second class: 18 females\n   - Third class: 17 females\n   \\[\n   13 + 18 + 17 = 48 \\text{ females}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of students who can pair up:**\n   - Each male student can pair with one female student.\n   - Since there are 46 males and 48 females, all 46 males can find a partner.\n   \\[\n   46 \\text{ pairs}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of students who will be left without a partner:**\n   - After pairing up 46 males and 46 females, there will be:\n     \\[\n     48 - 46 = 2 \\text{ females left without a partner}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students who will be unable to partner with a student of the opposite gender is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

Since each male needs to pair with a female, the number of pairs that can be formed is equal to the smaller of the total number of males and females. In this case, there are 46 males and 48 females, so the number of pairs that can be formed is 46.\n\nAfter forming these pairs, the number of students who will be left without a partner is the difference between the total number of males and females. Since there are 48 females and 46 males, the number of females left without a partner is:\n\\[\n48 - 46 = 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students who will be unable to partner with a student of the opposite gender is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

        "To determine how many students will be unable to partner with a student of the opposite gender when the three classes are combined, we first need to find the total number of male and female students.\n\nThe first class has 17 males and 13 females. The second class has 14 males and 18 females. The third class has 15 males and 17 females. Adding these together, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Total males} = 17 + 14 + 15 = 46\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total females} = 13 + 18 + 17 = 48\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many students can be paired up. Since each male can only partner with one female, the number of pairs that can be formed is equal to the minimum of the total number of males and the total number of females. In this case, the minimum is 46, so 46 pairs can be formed.\n\nAfter forming these pairs, we need to find out how many students are left without a partner. Since there are 46 pairs, 46 males and 46 females will be paired up. This leaves:\n\\[\n\\text{,:]◤ females left = 48 - 46 = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Males left} = 46 - 46 = 0\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students who will be unable to partner with a student of the opposite gender is:\n\\[\n2 + 0 = 2\n\\]\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many students will be unable to partner with a student of the opposite gender when the three classes are combined, we first need to calculate the total number of male and female students in the combined classes.\n\nThe first class has 17 males and 13 females.\nThe second class has 14 males and 18 females.\nThe third class has 15 males and 17 females.\n\nAdding these together, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Total males} = 17 + 14 + 15 = 46\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total females} = 13 + 18 + 17 = 48\n\\]\n\nIn square dancing, each male student pairs with a female student. Therefore, the number of students who can pair is the minimum of the total number of males and the total number of females. In this case, the minimum is 46.\n\nTo find out how many students will be unable to partner, we subtract the number of students who can pair from the total number of students:\n\\[\n\\text{Total students} = 46 + 48 = 94\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Students who cannot pair} = 94 - 2 \\times 46 = 94 - 92 = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students who will be unable to partner with a student of the opposite gender is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

Therefore, the number of pairs that can be formed is equal to the smaller of the total number of males and the total number of females. Here, the total number of males is 46 and the total number of females is 48.

Since each male needs to pair with a female, the maximum number of pairs is equal to the smaller of the two totals (the number of males or females). In this case, there are 46 males and 48 females, so the maximum number of pairs is 46.\n\nAfter forming 46 pairs, we will have:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining males} = 46 - 46 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining females} = 48 - 46 = 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students who will be unable to partner with a student of the opposite gender is the number of remaining females, which is 2.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
