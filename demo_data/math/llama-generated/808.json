        "To determine how much Gina makes per hour, we need to calculate the total time she spends painting the cups and then divide her total payment by this time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time Gina spends painting the rose cups. Gina can paint 6 rose cups per hour, and she has an order for 6 rose cups. Therefore, the time spent painting the rose cups is:\n\\[\n\\frac{6 \\text{ rose cups}}{6 \\text{ rose cups per hour}} = 1 \\text{ hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time Gina spends painting the lily cups.

Therefore, the time spent painting the lily cups is:\n\\[\n\\frac{14 \\text{ lily cups}}{7 \\text{ lily cups per hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the total time Gina spends painting all the cups. The total time is the sum of the time spent painting the rose cups and the time spent painting the lily cups:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ hour} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nGina gets paid $90 total for the order.
