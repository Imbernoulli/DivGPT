Since each soda costs $1, the cost of one soup is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of one soup} = 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Sean buys 2 soups, so the total cost of the soups is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of soups} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of Sandwich:**\n   The sandwich costs 3 times as much as the soup. Since each soup costs $3, the cost of the sandwich is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of the sandwich} = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Cost:**\n   Now, we add up the costs of all the items:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Total cost of soda} + \\text{Total cost of soups} + \\text{Cost of the sandwich}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we found:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 3 + 6 + 9 = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of everything Sean bought is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
