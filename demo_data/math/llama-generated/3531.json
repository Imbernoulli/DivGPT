        "To determine how much each family member will pay, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of people attending the reunion.\n2. Determine the total number of cans of soda needed.\n3. Calculate the total number of boxes of soda required.\n4. Find the total cost of the boxes of soda.\n5. Divide the total cost by the number of family members to find out how much each family member will pay.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of people attending the reunion.**\n   Since there are five dozens of people attending, we multiply 5 by 12:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 12 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, there are 60 people attending the reunion.\n\n2. **Determine the total number of cans of soda needed.**\n   Each person is assumed to consume 2 cans of soda, so we multiply the number of people by 2:\n   \\[\n   60 \\times 2 = 120\n   \\]\n   So, we need 120 cans of soda.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of boxes of soda required.**\n   Each box contains 10 cans, so we divide the total number of cans by 10:\n   \\[\n   120 \\div 10 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, we need 12 boxes of soda.\n\n4. **Find the total cost of the boxes of soda.**\n   Each box costs $2, so we multiply the number of boxes by 2:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 2 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the boxes of soda is $24.\n\n5. **Divide the total cost by the number of family members to find out how much each family member will pay.**\n   There are 6 family members, so we divide the total cost by 6:\n   \\[\n   24 \\div 6 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, each family member will pay $4.\n\nTherefore, each family member will pay \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
