        "To determine the total number of photos in Lilah's family gallery after their trip to the Grand Canyon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

Add the photos taken on both days to the original number of photos in the gallery.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of photos taken on the first day.**\n\nLilah's family took half as many photos as they have in the family gallery on the first day. The family gallery initially has 400 photos.\n\\[\n\\text{Photos taken on the first day} = \\frac{400}{2} = 200\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of photos taken on the second day.**\n\nLilah's family took 120 more photos on the second day than they took on the first day. Since they took 200 photos on the first day:\n\\[\n\\text{Photos taken on the second day} = 200 + 120 = 320\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the photos taken on both days to the original number of photos in the gallery.**\n\nThe original number of photos in the gallery is 400. The total number of photos taken on the trip is the sum of the photos taken on the first day and the second day:\n\\[\n\\text{Total photos taken on the trip} = 200 + 320 = 520\n\\]\n\nAdding these photos to the original number of photos in the gallery gives:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of photos in the gallery} = 400 + 520 = 920\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of photos in the gallery is \\boxed{920}.",
