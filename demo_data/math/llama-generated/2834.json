        "Let's start by determining the number of dimes Val initially has. According to the problem, Val has three times as many dimes as nickels. If Val initially has 20 nickels, then the number of dimes she has is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 20 = 60 \\text{ dimes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many new nickels Val finds in her brother's treasure box. The problem states that she finds twice as many nickels as she originally has. Since she originally has 20 nickels, the number of new nickels she finds is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ nickels}\n\\]\n\nAfter finding these new nickels, the total number of nickels Val has is:\n\\[\n20 + 40 = 60 \\text{ nickels}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total value of the money Val has. The value of the nickels is:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ nickels} \\times 0.05 \\text{ dollars/nickel} = 3 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThe value of the dimes is:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ dimes} \\times 0.10 \\text{ dollars/dime} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nAdding the value of the nickels and the value of the dimes gives us the total value of the money Val has:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ dollars} + 6 \\text{ dollars} = 9 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of the money Val has is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]",
        "To determine the value of money Val has after finding additional nickels from her brother's treasure box, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial number of dimes Val has:**\n   Val has three times as many dimes as nickels. Given she initially has 20 nickels, we can calculate the number of dimes as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of dimes} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of nickels} = 3 \\times 20 = 60\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of additional nickels Val finds:**\n   Val finds twice as many nickels as she initially has. Therefore, the number of additional nickels is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Additional nickels} = 2 \\times \\text{Initial number of nickels} = 2 \\times 20 = 40\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of nickels Val has after finding the additional ones:**\n   Adding the additional nickels to the initial number of nickels gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of nickels} = \\text{Initial number of nickels} + \\text{Additional nickels} = 20 + 40 = 60\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert the total number of nickels to dollars:**\n   Each nickel is worth $0.05. Therefore, the total value of the nickels is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value of nickels} = 60 \\times 0.05 = 3 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert the total number of dimes to dollars:**\n   Each dime is worth $0.10. Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Value of dimes} = 60 \\times 0.10 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total value of all the coins:**\n   Adding the value of the nickels and the value of the dimes gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total value} = \\text{Value of nickels} + \\text{Value of dimes} = 3 + 6 = 9 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of money Val has is \\(\\boxed{9}\\) dollars.",
