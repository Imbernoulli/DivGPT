Each team is made up of 10 members, and each member needs a pair of roller skates to compete in and another pair of skates as a backup. None of the skates have laces yet, so each member is offered 3 sets of laces per pair of skates. How many sets of laces have been handed out?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
