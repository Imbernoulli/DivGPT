Therefore, we can calculate the number of participants in 2019 as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 150 + 20 = 300 + 20 = 320\n\\]\nSo, there were 320 participants in 2019.\n\nNext, let's find the number of participants in 2020. According to the problem, the number of participants in 2020 was 40 less than half the number of participants in 2019. The number of participants in 2019 was 320. Therefore, we can calculate the number of participants in 2020 as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{320}{2} - 40 = 160 - 40 = 120\n\\]\nSo, there were 120 participants in 2020.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more participants there were in 2019 than in 2020. We do this by subtracting the number of participants in 2020 from the number of participants in 2019:\n\\[\n320 - 120 = 200\n\\]\nSo, there were \\(\\boxed{200}\\) more participants in 2019 than in 2020."
