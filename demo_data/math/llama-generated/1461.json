Therefore, the number of experienced sailors is:\n\\[ 17 - 5 = 12 \\]\n\nNext, we know that each experienced sailor is paid \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) times more than an inexperienced sailor. Since an inexperienced sailor is paid $10 per hour, the hourly wage of an experienced sailor is:\n\\[ 10 + \\left(10 \\times \\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 10 + 2 = 12 \\text{ dollars per hour} \\]\n\nThe weekly wage of an experienced sailor is the hourly wage multiplied by the number of hours worked in a week. Since each sailor works 60 hours per week, the weekly wage of an experienced sailor is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 60 = 720 \\text{ dollars per week} \\]\n\nThere are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly wage of an experienced sailor is:\n\\[ 720 \\times 4 = 2880 \\text{ dollars per month} \\]\n\nFinally, the total combined monthly earnings of all experienced sailors is the monthly wage of one experienced sailor multiplied by the number of experienced sailors:\n\\[ 2880 \\times 12 = 34560 \\]\n\nThus, the total combined monthly earnings of the experienced sailors is:\n\\[ \\boxed{34560} \\]",
