Find the total number of plants in both gardens.\n5. Calculate the percentage of tomato plants out of the total number of plants.\n\nLet's start with the first garden. Phyllis has 20 plants and 10% of them are tomato plants. So, the number of tomato plants in the first garden is:\n\\[ 20 \\times \\frac{10}{100} = 20 \\times 0.1 = 2 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of tomato plants in the second garden. Phyllis has 15 plants and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of them are tomato plants. So, the number of tomato plants in the second garden is:\n\\[ 15 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 15 \\div 3 = 5 \\]\n\nNow, we find the total number of tomato plants in both gardens by adding the number of tomato plants from each garden:\n\\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of plants in both gardens by adding the number of plants from each garden:\n\\[ 20 + 15 = 35 \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of tomato plants out of the total number of plants. This is done by dividing the total number of tomato plants by the total number of plants and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{7}{35} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.2 \\times 100 = 20\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of all the plants in her two gardens that are tomato plants is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

Find the total number of plants in both gardens.\n5. Calculate the percentage of all the plants that are tomato plants.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of tomato plants in the first garden.**\n\nPhyllis has 20 plants in the first garden, and 10% of them are tomato plants.\n\\[\n0.10 \\times 20 = 2\n\\]\nSo, there are 2 tomato plants in the first garden.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of tomato plants in the second garden.**\n\nPhyllis has 15 plants in the second garden, and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of them are tomato plants.\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 15 = 5\n\\]\nSo, there are 5 tomato plants in the second garden.\n\n**Step 3: Find the total number of tomato plants in both gardens.**\n\nAdd the number of tomato plants in the first garden to the number of tomato plants in the second garden.\n\\[\n2 + 5 = 7\n\\]\nSo, there are 7 tomato plants in total.\n\n**Step 4: Find the total number of plants in both gardens.**\n\nAdd the number of plants in the first garden to the number of plants in the second garden.\n\\[\n20 + 15 = 35\n\\]\nSo, there are 35 plants in total.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the percentage of all the plants that are tomato plants.**\n\nDivide the total number of tomato plants by the total number of plants, and then multiply by 100 to convert the fraction to a percentage.\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{7}{35} \\right) \\times 100 = 20\\%\n\\]\nSo, the percentage of all the plants in her two gardens that are tomato plants is \\(\\boxed{20}\\)."
