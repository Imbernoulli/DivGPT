Since we don't have information about the overlap between the two groups (employees who got both a salary increase and a travel allowance increase), we will assume there is no overlap for simplicity (which is a common approach in such problems unless otherwise specified).\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of employees who got at least one type of increase} = 48 + 96 = 144\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract the number of employees who got at least one type of increase from the total number of employees to find the number of employees who did not get any increase:\n   \\[\n   480 - 144 = 336\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of employees who did not get any increase is \\(\\boxed{336}\\).",

The number of employees who did not get any increase is:\n   \\[\n   480 - 144 = 336\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of employees who did not get any increase is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{336}\n\\]",
