        "To determine how many dollars more the adults' tickets cost in total than the children's tickets in total, we need to calculate the total cost of the adult tickets and the total cost of the children's tickets, and then find the difference between these two amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the adult tickets. There are 9 adults, and each adult ticket costs $11. Therefore, the total cost for the adult tickets is:\n\\[ 9 \\times 11 = 99 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the children's tickets. There are 7 children, and each children's ticket costs $7.

Calculate the total cost of the adult tickets.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the children's tickets.\n3. Find the difference between the total cost of the adult tickets and the total cost of the children's tickets.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the adult tickets:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of adult tickets} = \\text{Number of adults} \\times \\text{Cost per adult ticket}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of adult tickets} = 9 \\times 11 = 99 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the children's tickets:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of children's tickets} = \\text{Number of children} \\times \\text{Cost per child ticket}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of children's tickets} = 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the total cost of the adult tickets and the total cost of the children's tickets:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Total cost of adult tickets} - \\text{Total cost of children's tickets}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 99 - 49 = 50 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the adults' tickets cost \\(\\boxed{50}\\) dollars more in total than the children's tickets.",
        "To determine how many dollars more the adults' tickets cost in total than the children's tickets in total, we need to calculate the total cost of the adult tickets and the total cost of the children's tickets separately, and then find the difference between these two amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the adult tickets. The cost of one adult ticket is $11, and there are 9 adults. Therefore, the total cost for the adult tickets is:\n\\[ 9 \\times 11 = 99 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the children's tickets. The cost of one children's ticket is $7, and there are 7 children. Therefore, the total cost for the children's tickets is:\n\\[ 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many dollars more the adults' tickets cost in total than the children's tickets in total. We do this by subtracting the total cost of the children's tickets from the total cost of the adult tickets:\n\\[ 99 - 49 = 50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the adults' tickets cost \\(\\boxed{50}\\) dollars more in total than the children's tickets.",
