She recorded video of every player and plans to put it all together in a longer movie. She has 130 seconds of the point guard, 145 seconds of the shooting guard, 85 seconds of the small forward, 60 seconds of the power forward, and 180 seconds of the center. How on average, how many minutes does each player get?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
