        "To determine how much each of the remaining friends will pay, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much Silas will pay.\n2. Determine the remaining amount after Silas pays.\n3.

The tip is 10% of the total bill:\n\\[\n\\text{Tip} = 0.10 \\times 150 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo, the total amount to be paid by the remaining friends is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total remaining amount} = 75 + 15 = 90 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThere are 5 remaining friends (since Silas is already paying).
