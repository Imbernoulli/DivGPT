        "To determine the number of cookies each child will eat, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cookies.\n2. Determine the total number of children.\n3. Divide the total number of cookies by the total number of children.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cookies. Since his mother bought 3 packages of cookies and each package contains 25 cookies, we multiply the number of packages by the number of cookies per package:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 25 = 75 \\]\n\nSo, there are 75 cookies in total.\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of children.
