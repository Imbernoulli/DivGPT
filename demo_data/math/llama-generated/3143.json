        "To determine Lucy's bank balance after her transactions, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial amount of money Lucy has in the bank.\n2. Add the amount of money she deposits.\n3. Subtract the amount of money she withdraws.\n\nLet's perform these steps one by one.\n\n1. Lucy's initial bank balance is $65.\n2. She makes a $15 deposit. So, we add $15 to $65:\n   \\[\n   65 + 15 = 80\n   \\]\n   Now, Lucy's bank balance is $80.\n3. She then makes a $4 withdrawal.
