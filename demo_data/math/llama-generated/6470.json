        "To determine how many green tea leaves Anderson should add to a new batch of mud to get the same efficacy as before, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of green tea leaves in the original batch:**\n   - Anderson adds three sprigs of mint.\n   - For every sprig of mint, he adds two green tea leaves.\n   - Therefore, the number of green tea leaves is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ sprigs} \\times 2 \\text{ green tea leaves per sprig} = 6 \\text{ green tea leaves}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the effect of the new mud on the green tea leaves:**\n   - The new mud makes the other ingredients half as effective.\n   - This means that each green tea leaf will be half as effective as it was in the original mixture.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of green tea leaves needed in the new batch to achieve the same efficacy:**\n   - Since each green tea leaf is now half as effective, Anderson needs to double the number of green tea leaves to achieve the same total efficacy.\n   - Therefore, the number of green tea leaves needed in the new batch is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ green tea leaves} \\times 2 = 12 \\text{ green tea leaves}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Anderson should add \\(\\boxed{12}\\) green tea leaves to a new batch of mud to get the same efficacy as before.",
