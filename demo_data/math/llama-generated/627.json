        "To determine how much money Karen would save over 30 years by buying the more expensive coat, we need to calculate the total cost of each coat over the 30-year period and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the more expensive coat over 30 years. The more expensive coat costs $300 and lasts for 15 years.

Therefore, over 30 years, Karen would need to buy this coat six times:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of the less expensive coat} = 6 \\times 120 = 720 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the difference in total cost between the two coats to determine how much money Karen would save:\n\\[\n\\text{Savings} = \\text{Total cost of the less expensive coat} - \\text{Total cost of the more expensive coat} = 720 - 600 = 120 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, Karen would save \\(\\boxed{120}\\) dollars over 30 years by buying the more expensive coat.",
