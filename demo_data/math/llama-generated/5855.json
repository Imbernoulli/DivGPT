        "To determine how much money Rick and Sean have, we start by finding out how much money Sean has. According to the problem, Sean has 4 dollars more than half as much money as Fritz. Since Fritz has 40 dollars, we can calculate half of Fritz's money as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{40}{2} = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, we add 4 dollars to this amount to find out how much Sean has:\n\n\\[\n20 + 4 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, Sean has 24 dollars. Now, we need to find out how much money Rick has. The problem states that Rick has 3 times as much money as Sean. Therefore, we multiply Sean's money by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 24 = 72\n\\]\n\nSo, Rick has 72 dollars. To find out how much money Rick and Sean have together, we add Sean's money and Rick's money:\n\n\\[\n24 + 72 = 96\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Rick and Sean have \\boxed{96} dollars.",

        "To determine how much money Rick and Sean have, we start by finding out how much money Sean has. We know from the problem statement that Sean has 4 dollars more than half as much money as Fritz. Since Fritz has 40 dollars, we can calculate half of Fritz's money as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{40}{2} = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, we add 4 dollars to this amount to find out how much Sean has:\n\n\\[\n20 + 4 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, Sean has 24 dollars. Now, we need to find out how much money Rick has. According to the problem, Rick has 3 times as much money as Sean.
