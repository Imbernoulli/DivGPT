        "To determine how much Ryan will pay to buy 50 packs of snacks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time Kyle takes to travel to work and back.\n2. Determine the cost of one pack of snacks based on the total travel time.\n3. Calculate the total cost for 50 packs of snacks.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total time Kyle takes to travel to work and back.**\n\nKyle bikes for 2 hours to work and 2 hours back. Therefore, the total time for a round trip is:\n\\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost of one pack of snacks.**\n\nAccording to the problem, ten times the time he takes to travel to work and back is the same as the cost of buying a pack of snacks. So, we multiply the total travel time by 10:\n\\[ 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 50 packs of snacks.**\n\nNow, we need to find out how much Ryan will pay for 50 packs of snacks. We do this by multiplying the cost of one pack by 50:\n\\[ 40 \\times 50 = 2000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Ryan will pay to buy 50 packs of snacks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2000} \\]",
