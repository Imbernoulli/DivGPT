Since Caleb's grandfather is turning 79 years old, the total number of candles is 79.\n\nNext, we know the number of yellow candles is 27 and the number of red candles is 14. We need to find out how many blue candles there are. To do this, we subtract the number of yellow and red candles from the total number of candles.\n\nFirst, we add the number of yellow and red candles together:\n\\[ 27 + 14 = 41 \\]\n\nThen, we subtract this sum from the total number of candles:\n\\[ 79 - 41 = 38 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of blue candles Caleb used is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",
        "To determine how many blue candles Caleb used, we start by calculating the total number of candles on the cake. Since Caleb's grandfather is turning 79 years old, the total number of candles is 79.\n\nNext, we know that Caleb put 27 yellow candles and 14 red candles on the cake. We can find the total number of yellow and red candles by adding these two quantities together:\n\\[ 27 + 14 = 41 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of yellow and red candles from the total number of candles to find the number of blue candles:\n\\[ 79 - 41 = 38 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of blue candles Caleb used is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",
