        "To determine how much is left of Centerville's annual budget after spending on its public library and public parks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total annual budget:**\n   Centerville spends 15% of its annual budget on its public library, and we know that amount is $3,000. Let \\( B \\) represent the total annual budget. We can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.15B = 3000\n   \\]\n   To solve for \\( B \\), divide both sides by 0.15:\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{3000}{0.15} = 20000\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total annual budget is $20,000.\n\n2. **Calculate the amount spent on public parks:**\n   Centerville spends 24% of its annual budget on public parks. Using the total budget \\( B = 20000 \\), we can find the amount spent on public parks:\n   \\[\n   0.24B = 0.24 \\times 20000 = 4800\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the amount spent on public parks is $4,800.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount spent on both public library and public parks:**\n   Add the amount spent on the public library and the amount spent on public parks:\n   \\[\n   3000 + 4800 = 7800\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total amount spent on both public library and public parks is $7,800.\n\n4. **Calculate the remaining budget:**\n   Subtract the total amount spent from the total annual budget:\n   \\[\n   20000 - 7800 = 12200\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the amount left of the annual budget is \\(\\boxed{12200}\\).",

We can find the amount spent on the public parks by multiplying the total annual budget by 24% (or 0.24):\n\n\\[ \\text{Amount spent on public parks} = 0.24 \\times 20000 = 4800 \\]\n\nSo, the amount spent on the public parks is $4,800.\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the amounts spent on the public library and the public parks from the total annual budget.**\n\nNow, we subtract the amounts spent on the public library and the public parks from the total annual budget:\n\n\\[ \\text{Amount left} = 20000 - 3000 - 4800 = 12200 \\]\n\nSo, the amount left of the annual budget is \\(\\boxed{12200}\\).",

Using the total budget of $20,000, we can find the amount spent on public parks by multiplying:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount spent on public parks} = 0.24 \\times 20000 = 4800\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount spent on both public library and public parks:**\n   Add the amount spent on the public library and the amount spent on public parks:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount spent} = 3000 + 4800 = 7800\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the amount left of the annual budget:**\n   Subtract the total amount spent from the total annual budget:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount left} = 20000 - 7800 = 12200\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount left of the annual budget is \\(\\boxed{12200}\\).",
        "To determine how much is left of Centerville's annual budget after spending on the public library and public parks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total annual budget.\n2. Determine the amount spent on public parks.\n3. Subtract the amounts spent on the public library and public parks from the total annual budget.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total annual budget. We know that 15% of the annual budget is spent on the public library, and the amount spent on the public library is $3,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 0.15 \\times \\text{Total Annual Budget} = 3000 \\]\n\nTo find the total annual budget, we divide $3,000 by 0.15:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Annual Budget} = \\frac{3000}{0.15} = 20000 \\]\n\nSo, the total annual budget is $20,000.\n\nNext, we need to determine the amount spent on public parks. We know that 24% of the annual budget is spent on public parks. Therefore, we can calculate the amount spent on public parks as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Amount Spent on Public parks} = 0.24 \\times 20000 = 4800 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the amounts spent on the public library and public parks from the total annual budget to find out how much is left:\n\n\\[ \\text{Amount Left} = 20000 - 3000 - 4800 = 12200 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount left of the annual budget is \\(\\boxed{12200}\\).",
