Therefore, the total contribution is \\( 3x + 30 \\).\n   - According to the problem, the total contribution is also three times the amount Harry contributed. Therefore, the total contribution is \\( 3 \\times 30 = 90 \\).\n\n3. Set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   3x + 30 = 90\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve for \\( x \\):\n   - Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     3x = 60\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 3:\n     \\[\n     x = 20\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, each of Harry's friends contributed \\(\\boxed{20}\\) dollars.",

        "To determine the total amount of money each of Harry's friends contributed, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Let the total amount of money contributed by Harry's three friends be denoted by \\( x \\).\n2. Harry added $30 to the contribution, so the total contribution to the party is \\( x + 30 \\).\n3. According to the problem, the total contribution is three times as much as Harry contributed. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   x + 30 = 3 \\times 30\n   \\]\n4. Simplify the right side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   x + 30 = 90\n   \\]\n5. To find \\( x \\), subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   x = 90 - 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 60\n   \\]\n6. The total amount of money contributed by Harry's three friends is $60. Since the contribution is equally divided among the three friends, we divide $60 by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money that each of Harry's friends contributed is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
        "Let's denote the amount of money that each of Harry's friends contributed as \\( x \\).

Harry contributed $30, so the total contribution is also equal to \\( 3 \\times 30 = 90 \\).\n\nWe can set up the following equation to represent this situation:\n\\[ 3x + 30 = 90 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by isolating the variable. First, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3x = 90 - 30 \\]\n\\[ 3x = 60 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ x = \\frac{60}{3} \\]\n\\[ x = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, each of Harry's friends contributed \\(\\boxed{20}\\) dollars.",
