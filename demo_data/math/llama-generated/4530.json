Calculate the combined total number of students in the general study hall and the biology hall.\n3. Calculate the number of students in the math hall.\n4. Sum the number of students in the general study hall, the biology hall, and the math hall.\n\nFirst, we know there are 30 students in the general study hall. The number of students in the biology hall is twice as many as there are in the general study hall:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students in the biology hall} = 2 \\times 30 = 60\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the combined total number of students in the general study hall and the biology hall:\n\\[\n\\text{Combined total} = 30 + 60 = 90\n\\]\n\nThe number of students in the math hall is \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) times the combined total number of students in the general study hall and the biology hall:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students in the math hall} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 90 = \\frac{3 \\times 90}{5} = \\frac{270}{5} = 54\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the number of students in the general study hall, the biology hall, and the math hall to find the total number of students in all the halls combined:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of students} = 30 + 60 + 54 = 144\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of students in all the halls combined is \\(\\boxed{144}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of students in all the halls combined, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of students in the biology hall:**\n   - The number of students in the general study hall is 30.\n   - There are twice as many students in the biology hall as in the general study hall.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students in the biology hall} = 2 \\times 30 = 60\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the combined total number of students in the general study hall and the biology hall:**\n   - Number of students in the general study hall is 30.\n   - Number of students in the biology hall is 60.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined total} = 30 + 60 = 90\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of students in the math hall:**\n   - The number of students in the math hall is \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) times the combined total number of students in the general study hall and the biology hall.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students in the math hall} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 90 = \\frac{3 \\times 90}{5} = \\frac{270}{5} = 54\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of students in all the halls combined:**\n   - Number of students in the general study hall is 30.\n   - Number of students in the biology hall is 60.\n   - Number of students in the math hall is 54.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of students} = 30 + 60 + 54 = 144\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of students in all the halls combined is \\(\\boxed{144}\\)."
