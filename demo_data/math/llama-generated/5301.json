She spent 10 minutes downloading the Mac version, only to realize she needed the Windows version, which took three times as long to download. During her first call, the audio glitched twice for 4 minutes each time and the video glitched once for 6 minutes. She spent twice as long talking without glitches as with glitches. How much time did Mary spend downloading Zoom and talking total?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Therefore, the Windows version took \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\) minutes.\n   - The total time spent downloading Zoom is \\(10 + 30 = 40\\) minutes.\n\n2. **Talking on Zoom:**\n   - During her first call, the audio glitched twice for 4 minutes each time, so the total time spent on audio glitches is \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) minutes.\n   - The video glitchesanging once for 6 minutes, so the total time spent on video glitch is \\(1 \\times 6 = 6\\) minutes.\n   - The total time spent with glitches is \\(8 + 6 = 14\\) minutes.\n   - Mary spent twice as long talking without glitches as with glitches. Therefore, the time spent talking without glitches is \\(2 \\times 14 = 28\\) minutes.\n   - The total time spent talking on Zoom is \\(14 + 28 = 42\\) minutes.\n\n3. **Total time spent downloading Zoom and talking:**\n   - Adding the time spent downloading Zoom and the time spent talking on Zoom gives \\(40 + 42 = 82\\) minutes.\n\nThus, the total time Mary spent downloading Zoom and talking is \\(\\boxed{82}\\).",
        "To determine the total time Mary spent downloading Zoom and talking, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each step by step.\n\n1. **Downloading Zoom:**\n   - Mary spent 10 minutes downloading the Mac version.\n   - She then downloaded the Windows version, which took three times as long as the Mac version.\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Total time spent downloading Zoom:\n     \\[\n     10 + 30 = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n2. **�至少 интерес Zoom Shut:**\n   - The audio glitched twice for 4 minutes each time:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - The video glitched once for 6 minutes:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 6 = 6 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Total time spent with glitches:\n     \\[\n     8 + 6 = 14 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Talking without glutennuts:**\n   - Mary spent twice as long talking without glitches as with glitches:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 14 = 28 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total time spent talking:**\n   - Total time spent talking (with and without glitches):\n     \\[\n     14 + 28 = 42 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Total time spent downloading Zoom and talking:**\n   \\[\n   40 + 42 = 82 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total time Mary spent downloading Zoom and talking is \\(\\boxed{82}\\) minutes."
