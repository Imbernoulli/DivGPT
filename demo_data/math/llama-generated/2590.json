        "To determine how much Dawn saves each month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Dawn's monthly salary.\n2. Determine what 10% of her monthly salary is.\n\nFirst, we calculate Dawn's monthly salary. Since she earns $48,000 a year and there are 12 months in a year, we divide her annual salary by 12:\n\\[\n\\text{Monthly salary} = \\frac{48,000}{12} = 4,000\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate 10% of her monthly salary. To find 10% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.10:\n\\[\n\\text{Monthly savings} = 4,000 \\times 0.10 = 400\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Dawn saves \\(\\boxed{400}\\) dollars each month.",
        "To determine how much Dawn saves each month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Dawn's monthly salary:**\n   Dawn earns a total of $48,000 per year, and she receives this in 12 equal monthly payments. Therefore, her monthly salary is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly Salary} = \\frac{48,000}{12}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly Salary} = 4,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the amount Dawn saves each month:**\n   Dawn saves 10% of her monthly salary. To find 10% of $4,000, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly Savings} = \\text{Monthly Salary} \\times \\frac{10}{100}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{100} = 0.10\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly Savings} = 4,000 \\times 0.10\n   \\]\n   Performing the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly Savings} = 400\n   \\]\n\nThus, Dawn saves \\(\\boxed{400}\\) dollars each month."
