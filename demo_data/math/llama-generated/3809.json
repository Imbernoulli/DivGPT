        "To determine the total number of apples Anna ate over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples she ate each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that on Tuesday, Anna ate 4 apples. So, the number of apples she ate on Tuesday is:\n\\[ 4 \\]\n\nNext, on Wednesday, she ate double the number of apples she ate on Tuesday. Since she ate 4 apples on Tuesday, the number of apples she ate on Wednesday is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\n\nOn Thursday, Anna ate half the number of apples she ate on Tuesday. Since she ate 4 apples on Tuesday, the number of apples she ate on Thursday is:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of apples she ate on each day to find the total number of apples she ate over the three days:\n\\[ 4 + 8 + 2 = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of apples Anna has eaten by the end of these three days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]",
