The competition was split into four rounds. Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff in the first round. Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam in the second round. Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam in the third round. Jeff got tired and only completed half the number of skips as Sam in the last round.

Let's break it down round by round:\n\n1. **First Round**: Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jeff's skips in the first round} = 16 - 1 = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Round**: Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jeff's skips in the second round} = 16 - 3 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Round**: Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jeff's skips in the third round} = 16 + 4 = 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourth Round**: Jeff skipped half the number of skips as Sam.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jeff's skips in the fourth round} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n   \\]\n\nNext, we sum up the number of skips Jeff completed in all four rounds:\n\\[\n15 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 56\n\\]\n\nTo find the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff, we divide the total number of skips by the number of rounds (which is 4):\n\\[\n\\text{Average skips per round} = \\frac{56}{4} = 14\n\\]\n\nThus, the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
