They drove at a constant speed of 62 miles/hour, taking breaks of 30 minutes every 5 hours. Once in the city, they looked for the hotel for 30 minutes. If the trip took around 2,790 miles, how many hours will they have to spend to complete the trip to the hotel?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total time spent on the road trip, we need to consider both the driving time and the break time. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the driving time:**\n   The total distance of the trip is 2,790 miles, and the speed is 62 miles per hour. The driving time can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Driving time} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{2790 \\text{ miles}}{62 \\text{ miles/hour}} = 45 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the break time:**\n   The friends take a 30-minute break every 5 hours of driving. To find out how many breaks they take, we divide the total driving time by 5:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of breaks} = \\frac{45 \\text{ hours}}{5 \\text{ hours/break}} = 9 \\text{ breaks}\n   \\]\n   Since each break is 30 minutes, the total break time is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total break time} = 9 \\text{ breaks} \\times 30 \\text{ minutes/break} = 270 \\text{ minutes} = 4.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total time spent on the trip:**\n   The total time spent on the trip includes the driving time, the break time, and the time spent looking for the hotel. The time spent looking for the hotel is 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. Therefore, the total time spent on the trip is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\text{Driving time} + \\text{Total break time} + \\text{Time spent looking for the hotel} = 45 \\text{ hours} + 4.5 \\text{ hours} + 0.5 \\text{ hours} = 50 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThe total time they will have to spend to complete the trip to the hotel is \\(\\boxed{50}\\) hours.",
