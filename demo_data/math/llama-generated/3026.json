        "To determine the total number of leaves on the tree, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of twigs on the tree.\n2. Determine how many twigs sprout 4 leaves and how many sprout 5 leaves.\n3. Calculate the total number of leaves from the twigs that sprout 4 leaves.\n4. Calculate the total number of leaves from the twigs that sprout 5 leaves.\n5. Add the two totals together to get the total number of leaves on the tree.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The tree has 30 branches, and each branch has 90 twigs. Therefore, the total number of twigs is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 90 = 2700 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many twigs sprout 4 leaves and how many sprout 5 leaves. Since 30% of the twigs sprout 4 leaves, the number of twigs that sprout 4 leaves is:\n\\[ 0.30 \\times 2700 = 810 \\]\n\nThe remaining twigs sprout 5 leaves. Since there are 2700 twigs in total and 810 sprout 4 leaves, the number of twigs that sprout 5 leaves is:\n\\[ 2700 - 810 = 1890 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of leaves from the twigs that sprout 4 leaves:\n\\[ 810 \\times 4 = 3240 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of leaves from the twigs that sprout 5 leaves:\n\\[ 1890 \\times 5 = 9450 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the two totals together to get the total number of leaves on the tree:\n\\[ 3240 + 9450 = 12690 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of leaves on the tree is:\n\\[ \\boxed{12690} \\]",

Calculate the total number of twigs on the tree.\n   The tree has 30 branches, and each branch has 90 twigs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of twigs} = 30 \\times 90 = 2700\n   \\]\n\n2.

Since 70% of the twigs sprout 5 leaves, we calculate 70% of 2700.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of twigs that sprout 5 leaves} = 0.70 \\times 2700 = 1890\n   \\]\n\n3.

Add the two totals together to get the total number of leaves on the tree.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of leaves} = 3240 + 9450 = 12690\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of leaves on the tree is \\boxed{12690}.",
