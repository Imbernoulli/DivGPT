Determine the cost of each soda.\n\nFirst, we know that John paid with a 20 dollar bill and received $14 in change. This means the total cost of the sodas is:\n\\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we know that John bought 3 sodas. To find the cost of each soda, we divide the total cost of the sodas by the number of sodas:\n\\[ 6 \\div 3 = 2 \\text{ dollars per soda} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of each soda is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."
