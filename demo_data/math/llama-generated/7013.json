        "To determine the total number of miles Jennifer will travel to visit both museums, we need to consider the distance she travels to each museum and back home each day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Jennifer travels to the museum that is 5 miles away:\n- She drives 5 miles to the museum.\n- She drives 5 miles back home.\n- Therefore, the total distance for one trip to this museum is \\(5 + 5 = 10\\) miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance Jennifer travels to the museum that is 15 miles away:\n- She drives 15 miles to the museum.\n- She drives 15 miles back home.\n- Therefore, the total distance for one trip to this museum is \\(15 + 15 = 30\\) miles.\n\nNow, we add the distances for both trips to find the total distance Jennifer will travel:\n\\[10 + 30 = 40\\]\n\nSo, the total number of miles Jennifer will travel is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
