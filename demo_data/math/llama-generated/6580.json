        "To determine the total number of apple trees planted by Ava and Lily collectively, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many apple trees Ava planted.\n2. Determine how many apple trees Lily planted.\n3. Add the number of apple trees planted by Ava and Lily together.\n\nFirst, we know that Ava planted 9 apple trees. According to the problem, this is 3 more than Lily planted. Therefore, we can find out how many apple trees Lily planted by subtracting 3 from the number of apple trees Ava planted:\n\\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \\]\nSo, Lily planted 6 apple trees.\n\nNext, we add the number of apple trees planted by Ava and Lily together:\n\\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of apple trees planted by Ava and Lily collectively is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",

Therefore, we can find out how many apple trees Lily planted by subtracting 3 from the number of apple trees Ava planted:\n\n\\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \\]\n\nSo, Lily planted 6 apple trees.\n\nNext, we add the number of apple trees planted by Ava and Lily together:\n\n\\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of apple trees planted by Ava and Lily collectively is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
