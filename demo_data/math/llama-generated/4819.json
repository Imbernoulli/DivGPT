        "To determine how many cans Yoki picked up, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of cans LaDonna picked up.\n2. Calculate the number of cans Prikya picked up.\n3. Subtract the number of cans picked up by LaDonna and Prikya from the total number of cans collected to find out how many cans Yoki picked up.\n\nFirst, we know that LaDonna picked up 25 cans.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of cans Prikya picked up. According to the problem, Prikya picked up twice as many cans as LaDonna. Therefore, we multiply the number of cans LaDonna picked up by 2:\n\\[ 25 \\times 2 = 50 \\]\n\nNow, we know that LaDonna picked up 25 cans and Prikya picked up 50 cans. To find out how many cans Yoki picked up, we subtract the total number of cans picked up by LaDonna and Prikya from the total number of cans collected:\n\\[ 85 - 25 - 50 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, Yoki picked up \\(\\boxed{10}\\) cans.",

Prikya picked up twice as many cans as LaDonna. Therefore, we calculate the number of cans Prikya picked up as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 25 = 50\n\\]\nSo, Prikya picked up 50 cans.\n\nNext, we find the total number of cans picked up by LaDonna and Prikya:\n\\[\n25 + 50 = 75\n\\]\nSo, LaDonna and Prikya together picked up 75 cans.\n\nSince the total number of cans collected is 85, we subtract the number of cans picked up by LaDonna and Prikya from the total number of cans to find out how many cans Yoki picked up:\n\\[\n85 - 75 = 10\n\\]\nSo, Yoki picked up \\boxed{10} cans."
