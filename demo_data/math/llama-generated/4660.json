But when the monkey is frightened, it will run along the branches at a speed of 15 feet per second.  If a Lamplighter monkey runs for 5 seconds to evade a predator, then swings for another 10 seconds to add distance between itself and the predator, how far, in feet, will the monkey travel?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
