        "To determine how many pairs of shoes Codger needs to buy to have 5 complete 3-piece sets of shoes, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of shoes required for 5 complete sets:**\n   Each set consists of 3 shoes.

Determine how many pairs of shoes Codger needs to buy.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of shoes Codger needs for 5 complete sets.

Convert the number of shoes needed into pairs.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of shoes Codger needs to have 5 complete 3-piece sets.**\n\nEach set consists of 3 shoes, and Codger wants 5 sets.\n\\[\n5 \\text{ sets} \\times 3 \\text{ shoes per set} = 15 \\text{ shoes}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many shoes Codger already has.**\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tangu has 3 pieces of shoes he is wearing.\n\\[\n\\text{Shoes already have} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many more shoes Codger needs to buy.**\n\nSubtract the number of shoes Codger already has from the total number of shoes he needs.\n\\[\n15 \\text{ shoes needed} - 3 \\text{ shoes already have} = 12 \\text{ shoes needed}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Convert the number of shoes needed into pairs.**\n\nSince each pair consists of 2 shoes, divide the number of shoes needed by 2.\n\\[\n\\frac{12 \\text{ shoes needed}}{2 \\text{ shoes per pair}} = 6 \\text{ pairs}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Codger needs to buy \\boxed{6} pairs of shoes to have 5 complete 3-piece sets of shoes.",
        "To determine how many pairs of shoes Codger needs to buy to have 5 complete 3-piece sets of shoes, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of shoes Codger needs for 5 complete sets.\n2. Subtract the number of shoes Codger already has.\n3. Determine how many pairs of shoes are equivalent to the remaining number of shoes.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of shoes Codger needs for 5 complete sets.**\n\nEach set consists of 3 shoes. Therefore, for 5 sets, the total number of shoes needed is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\text{ shoes} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Subtract the number of shoes Codger already has.**\n\nCodger already owns 3 shoes. Therefore, the number of additional shoes he needs is:\n\\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \\text{ shoes} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many pairs of shoes are equivalent to the remaining number of shoes.**\n\nSince each pair consists of 2 shoes, the number of pairs needed is:\n\\[ \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\text{ pairs} \\]\n\nThus, Codger needs to buy \\(\\boxed{6}\\) pairs of shoes to have 5 complete 3-piece sets of shoes.",
