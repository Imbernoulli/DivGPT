        "To determine how many boar sausages Mr. Castiel has left, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of sausages eaten on Monday:**\n   Mr. Castiel ate \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the 600 sausages.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{5} \\times 600 = 240\n   \\]\n   So, he ate 240 sausages on Monday.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of sausages remaining after Monday:**\n   Subtract the sausages eaten on Monday from the total.\n   \\[\n   600 - 240 = 360\n   \\]\n   So, there are 360 sausages remaining after Monday.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of sausages eaten on Tuesday:**\n   Mr. Castiel ate half of the remaining sausages.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times 360 = 180\n   \\]\n   So, he ate 180 sausages on Tuesday.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of sausages remaining after Tuesday:**\n   Subtract the sausages eaten on Tuesday from the remaining sausages after Monday.\n   \\[\n   360 - 180 = 180\n   \\]\n   So, there are 180 sausages remaining after Tuesday.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of sausages eaten on Friday:**\n   Mr. Castiel ate \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of the remaining sausages.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\times 180 = 135\n   \\]\n   So, he ate 135 sausages on Friday.\n\n6. **Calculate the number of sausages left after Friday:**\n   Subtract the sausages eaten on Friday from the remaining sausages after Tuesday.\n   \\[\n   180 - 135 = 45\n   \\]\n   So, there are 45 sausages left.\n\nTherefore, the number of sausages left is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
