        "To determine the age of Betty's granddaughter, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the age of Betty's daughter:**\n   - Betty is 60 years old.\n   - Her daughter is 40 percent younger than Betty.\n   - To find 40 percent of Betty's age:\n     \\[\n     0.40 \\times 60 = 24\n     \\]\n   - Subtract this from Betty's age to get the daughter's age:\n     \\[\n     60 - 24 = 36\n     \\]\n   Therefore, Betty's daughter is 36 years old.\n\n2. **Find the age of Betty's granddaughter:**\n   - The granddaughter is one-third her mother's age.\n   - To find one-third of the daughter's age:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{36}{3} = 12\n     \\]\n   Therefore, Betty's granddaughter is 12 years old.\n\nThus, the age of the granddaughter is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
        "To determine the age of Betty's granddaughter, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the age of Betty's daughter.\n2. Use the daughter's age to find the age of the granddaughter.\n\nFirst, we calculate the age of Betty's daughter. Since Betty is 60 years old and her daughter is 40 percent younger than she is, we need to find 40 percent of 60 and subtract that from 60.\n\n\\[\n40\\% \\text{ of } 60 = 0.40 \\times 60 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, the age of Betty's daughter is:\n\n\\[\n60 - 24 = 36\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the age of the granddaughter. The granddaughter is one-third her mother's age. Since her mother is 36 years old, we need to find one-third of 36.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\text{ of } 36 = \\frac{36}{3} = 12\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the age of the granddaughter is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",

To find the granddaughter's age, we calculate one-third of her daughter's age:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Granddaughter's age} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 36\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 36\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 36 = 12\n\\]\n\nSo, Betty's granddaughter is 12 years old.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",
