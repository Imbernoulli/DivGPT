        "To determine how long it will take John to finish the game after increasing his playtime, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours John has already played.\n2. Determine the total number of hours John needs to play to complete the game.\n3. Calculate how many more hours John needs to play after increasing his playtime.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours John has already played.**\n\nJohn plays for 4 hours a day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days he has played is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ weeks} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 14 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nThe total number of hours he has played is:\n\\[ 14 \\text{ days} \\times 4 \\text{ hours/day} = 56 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of hours John needs to play to complete the game.**\n\nJohn is 40% done with the game after playing for 56 hours. Therefore, 56 hours represents 40% of the total playtime required. Let \\( T \\) be the total number of hours needed to complete the game. Then:\n\\[ 0.4T = 56 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( T \\):\n\\[ T = \\frac{56}{0.4} = 140 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many more hours John needs to play after increasing his playtime.**\n\nJohn has already played 56 hours, so the remaining number of hours needed is:\n\\[ 140 \\text{ hours} - 56 \\text{ hours} = 84 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nJohn now plays for 7 hours a day. The number of days required to play the remaining 84 hours is:\n\\[ \\frac{84 \\text{ hours}}{7 \\text{ hours/day}} = 12 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, the time it will take John to finish the game is:\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]",
