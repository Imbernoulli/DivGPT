        "To determine how much John spent on pins, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the discount amount per pin:**\n   - The original price of each pin is $20.\n   - The discount is 15%.\n   - Convert the percentage to a decimal: \\( 15\\% = 0.15 \\).\n   - Multiply the original price by the discount rate: \n     \\[\n     20 \\times 0.15 = 3\n     \\]\n   - So, the discount amount per pin is $3.\n\n2. **Calculate the sale price per pin:**\n   - Subtract the discount amount from the original price:\n     \\[\n     20 - 3 = 17\n     \\]\n   - So, the sale price per pin is $17.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for 10 pins:**\n   - Multiply the sale price per pin by the number of pins:\n     \\[\n     17 \\times 10 = 170\n     \\]\n   - So, the total amount John spent on pins is $170.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{170}\n\\]",
