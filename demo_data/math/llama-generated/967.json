After buying 5 pizzas, she must decide how many slices to divide each pizza into so that everyone at the party ends up with an equal number of slices.  There are a total of 20 children at the party, and she can choose to divide each pizza into either 6, 8, or 10 slices.  Assuming she does not want to throw away any pizza, how should many slices should she choose to divide the pizzas into to make sure everyone receives an equal amount?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

If each pizza is divided into 6 slices:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ pizzas} \\times 6 \\text{ slices per pizza} = 30 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n   We check if 30 slices can be divided equally among 20 children:\n   \\[\n   30 \\div 20 = 1.5\n   \\]\n   Since 1.5 is not an integer, 30 slices cannot be divided equally among 20 children.\n\n2. If each pizza is divided into 8 slices:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ pizzas} \\times 8 \\text{ slices per pizza} = 40 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n   We check if 40 slices can be divided equally among 20 children:\n   \\[\n   40 \\div 20 = 2\n   \\]\n   Since 2 is an integer, 40 slices can be divided equally among 20 children.\n\n3. If each pizza is divided into 10 slices:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ pizzas} \\times 10 \\text{ slices per pizza} = 50 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n   We check if 50 slices can be divided equally among 20 children:\n   \\[\n   50 \\div 20 = 2.5\n   \\]\n   Since 2.5 is not an integer, 50 slices cannot be divided equally among 20 children.\n\nFrom the above calculations, we see that the only number of slices per pizza that allows the total number of slices to be evenly divisible by 20 is 8. Therefore, the mother should choose to divide each pizza into \\(\\boxed{8}\\) slices.",
        "To determine how many slices each pizza should be divided into so that everyone at the party ends up with an equal number of slices, we need to check the total number of pizza slices for each possible division option and see if it can be evenly divided among the 20 children.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of pizza slices for each option:\n- If each pizza is divided into 6 slices, then 5 pizzas will have \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\) slices.\n- If each pizza is divided into 8 slices, then 5 pizzas will have \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\) slices.\n- If each pizza is divided into 10 slices, then 5 pizzas will have \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\) slices.\n\nNext, we need to check if each of these totals can be evenly divided by 20:\n- \\(30 \\div 20 = 1.5\\), which is not an integer.\n- \\(40 \\div 20 = 2\\), which is an integer.\n- \\(50 \\div 20 = 2.5\\), which is not an integer.\n\nSince \\(40 \\div 20 = 2\\) is an integer, the only option that allows each child to receive an equal number of slices is to divide each pizza into 8 slices. Therefore, the mother should choose to divide each pizza into \\(\\boxed{8}\\) slices."
