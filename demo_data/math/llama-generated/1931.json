        "To determine how many computers John was able to fix right away, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of unfixable computers.\n2. Calculate the number of computers that needed to wait for spare parts.\n3. Subtract the number of unfixable computers and the number of computers that needed to wait for spare parts from the total number of computers to find out how many were fixed right away.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of unfixable computers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of unfixable computers} = 20\\% \\text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \\times 20 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of computers that needed to wait for spare parts:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of computers that needed to wait for spare parts} = 40\\% \\text{ of } 20 = 0.40 \\times 20 = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract the number of unfixable computers and the number of computers that needed to wait for spare parts from the total number of computers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of computers fixed right away} = 20 - 4 - 8 = 8\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of computers John was able to fix right away is \\boxed{8}.",
        "To determine how many computers John was able to fix right away, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of unfixable computers.\n2. Calculate the number of computers that needed to wait for spare parts.\n3. Subtract the sum of the unfixable computers and the computers needing spare parts from the total number of computers to find the number of computers John was able to fix right away.\n\nLet's start with the first step. John had 20 computers and 20% of them were unfixable. So, the number of unfixable computers is:\n\\[ 20 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 20 \\times 0.20 = 4 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of computers that needed to wait for spare parts.

So, the number of computers needing spare parts is:\n\\[ 20 \\times \\frac{40}{100} = 20 \\times 0.40 = 8 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of unfixable computers and the number of computers needing spare parts from the total number of computers to find the number of computers John was able to fix right away:\n\\[ 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of computers John was able to fix right away is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",

So, the number of unfixable computers is:\n\\[ 20 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 20 \\times 0.20 = 4 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of computers that needed to wait for spare parts. 40% of the computers needed to wait for spare parts. So, the number of computers that needed to wait for spare parts is:\n\\[ 20 \\times \\frac{40}{100} = 20 \\times 0.40 = 8 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of unfixable computers and the number of computers that needed to wait for spare parts to find out how many computers were not fixed right away:\n\\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of computers that were not fixed right away from the total number of computers to find the number of computers that were fixed right away:\n\\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of computers John was able to fix right away is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",
