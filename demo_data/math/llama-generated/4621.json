        "To determine the total number of pets Frankie has, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the number of dogs:**\n   Frankie has 2 dogs.\n\n2. **Determine the number of pets with four legs:**\n   Six of Frankie's pets have four legs. Since dogs have four legs, we subtract the number of dogs from the total number of four-legged pets to find the number of cats:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2 = 4\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Frankie has 4 cats.\n\n3. **Determine the number of snakes:**\n   Frankie has six more snakes than he has cats. Since he has 4 cats, the number of snakes is:\n   \\[\n   4 + 6 = 10\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of parrots:**\n   Frankie has one less parrot than he has cats. Since he has 4 cats, the number of parrots is:\n   \\[\n   4 - 1 = 3\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of pets:**\n   Add the number of dogs, cats, snakes, and parrots:\n   \\[\n   2 + 4 + 10 + 3 = 19\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pets Frankie has is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).",
