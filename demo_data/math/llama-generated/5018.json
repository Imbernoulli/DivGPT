        "To determine how many cherry saplings Kim has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cherry pits that sprout.\n2. Subtract the number of saplings Kim sells from the number of sprouted pits.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many cherry pits sprout. Kim plants 80 cherry pits and 25% of them sprout. We calculate 25% of 80 as follows:\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 80 = 20\n\\]\nSo, 20 cherry pits sprout.\n\nNext, Kim sells 6 of the sprouted saplings. To find out how many saplings she has left, we subtract the number of saplings she sells from the number of sprouted pits:\n\\[\n20 - 6 = 14\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cherry saplings Kim has left is \\boxed{14}.",
