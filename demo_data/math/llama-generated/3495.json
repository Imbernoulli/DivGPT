        "Let's denote the amount of money Pam had in her bank account at the beginning of the year as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the balance of Pam's bank account tripled during the year. Therefore, at the end of the year, her balance was \\( 3x \\).\n\nNext, Pam withdrew $250 from her bank account. So, her balance after the withdrawal was \\( 3x - 250 \\).\n\nWe know that after the withdrawal, Pam's current balance is $950. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 3x - 250 = 950 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve this equation step by step. First, we add 250 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3x - 250 + 250 = 950 + 250 \\]\n\\[ 3x = 1200 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ \\frac{3x}{3} = \\frac{1200}{3} \\]\n\\[ x = 400 \\]\n\nSo, Pam had \\(\\boxed{400}\\) dollars in her bank account at the beginning of the year.",

Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   3x - 250 = 950\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   To find \\( x \\), we need to isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation.
