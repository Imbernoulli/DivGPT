        "First, we determine the total number of apple slices Tom has initially. Since Tom splits 2 apples into 8 slices each, we calculate:\n\\[\n2 \\times 8 = 16 \\text{ slices}\n\\]\nNext, Tom gives 3/8 of the apple slices to his friend Jerry. To find out how many slices this is, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8} \\times 16 = 6 \\text{ slices}\n\\]\nAfter giving 6 slices to Jerry, Tom has:\n\\[\n16 - 6 = 10 \\text{ slices}\n\\]\nThen, Tom eats half of the remaining slices. To find out how many slices he eats, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 = 5 \\text{ slices}\n\\]\nAfter eating 5 slices, Tom has:\n\\[\n10 - 5 = 5 \\text{ slices}\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of apple slices Tom has left is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
