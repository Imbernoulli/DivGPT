        "Let's start by determining the cost of each type of ticket. The regular ticket for adults costs $9, and the ticket for children is $2 less, so it costs $7.\n\nThe family consists of 2 adults and an unknown number of children. Let's denote the number of children by \\( x \\).\n\nThe total cost of the tickets can be expressed as:\n\\[ 2 \\times 9 + x \\times 7 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 18 + 7x \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the family gave the cashier two $20 bills, which is $40, and received $1 in change. Therefore, the total cost of the tickets is:\n\\[ 40 - 1 = 39 \\]\n\nWe can now set up the equation:\n\\[ 18 + 7x = 39 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 7x = 39 - 18 \\]\n\\[ 7x = 21 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 7:\n\\[ x = \\frac{21}{7} \\]\n\\[ x = 3 \\]\n\nSo, the number of children is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
        "Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of children.\n- The cost of an adult ticket is $9.\n- The cost of a child ticket is $2 less than the adult ticket, so it is $9 - $2 = $7.\n- There are 2 adults in the family.\n- They gave the cashier two $20 bills, which totals $40.\n- They received $1 in change.\n\nThe total cost of the tickets can be expressed as the sum of the cost of the adult tickets and the cost of the child tickets. The equation is:\n\\[ 9 \\times 2 + 7 \\times c = 40 - 1 \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[ 18 + 7c = 39 \\]\n\nNext, isolate the term with the variable \\( c \\) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 7c = 39 - 18 \\]\n\\[ 7c = 21 \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( c \\) by dividing both sides by 7:\n\\[ c = \\frac{21}{7} \\]\n\\[ c = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of children is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
        "To determine the number of children in the family, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Identify the cost of each type of ticket:\n   - The regular ticket for adults costs $9.\n   - The ticket for children costs $2 less than the regular ticket, so it costs $9 - $2 = $7.\n\n2. Determine the total amount of money given to the cashier and the change received:\n   - The family gave the cashier two $20 bills, which is $20 + $20 = $40.\n   - They received $1 change, so the total amount spent on the tickets is $40 - $1 = $39.\n\n3.
