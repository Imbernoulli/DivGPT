        "To determine how many of his friends can have a sandwich and a pack of juice, we first need to calculate the total cost for one friend to have both items. The cost of one sandwich is $0.30 and the cost of one pack of juice is $0.20. Therefore, the total cost for one friend is:\n\\[0.30 + 0.20 = 0.50 \\text{ dollars}\\]\n\nNext, we need to account for Lyle himself. Since Lyle is also buying a sandwich and a pack of juice, he will spend $0.50. Therefore, the total amount of money spent by Lyle and his friends is:\n\\[0.50 + 0.50 \\times \\text{(number of friends)}\\]\n\nWe know that Lyle has $2.50, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:\n\\[0.50 + 0.50 \\times \\text{(number of friends)} \\leq 2.50\\]\n\nTo isolate the number of friends, we first subtract $0.50 from both sides of the inequality:\n\\[0.50 \\times \\text{(number of friends)} \\leq 2.00\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by $0.50$:\n\\[\\text{(number of friends)} \\leq \\frac{2.00}{0.50} = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, Lyle can have a sandwich and a pack of juice for 4 of his friends. The final answer is:\n\\[\\boxed{4}\\]",

Therefore, the total cost for one sandwich and one pack of juice is:\n\n\\[0.30 + 0.20 = 0.50\\]\n\nThis means that each friend will cost Lyle $0.50. Lyle has $2.50, and he also wants to buy himself a sandwich and a pack of juice.

Since each friend's sandwich and pack of juice costs $0.50, we divide $2.00 by $0.50:\n\n\\[2.00 \\div 0.50 = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, Lyle can buy a sandwich and a pack of juice for 4 of his friends.
