        "To determine how much Shem earns for an 8-hour workday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how much Shem earns per hour.\n2. Calculate Shem's total earnings for an 8-hour workday.\n\nFirst, we know that Kem earns $4 per hour and Shem makes 2.5 times more money per hour than Kem. Therefore, we can calculate Shem's hourly wage as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Shem's hourly wage} = 2.5 \\times \\text{Kem's hourly wage} = 2.5 \\times 4 = 10\n\\]\nSo, Shem earns $10 per hour.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much Shem earns for an 8-hour workday. We do this by multiplying his hourly wage by the number of hours he works:\n\\[\n\\text{Shem's daily earnings} = \\text{Shem's hourly wage} \\times \\text{number of hours worked} = 10 \\times 8 = 80\n\\]\nTherefore, Shem earns \\(\\boxed{80}\\) dollars for an 8-hour workday.",
