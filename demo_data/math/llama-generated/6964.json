Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of payments is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ years} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 60 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nNext, we multiply the monthly payment by the total number of payments to find the total amount paid over the loan period:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 60 \\text{ months} = 15000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the down payment to the total amount paid over the loan period to find the price of the car:\n\\[ 15000 \\text{ dollars} + 5000 \\text{ dollars} = 20000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the price of the car is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20000} \\]",
