        "To determine the average number of tickets Carol sold each day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Carol sold over the three days.\n2. Divide the total number of tickets by the number of days to find the average.\n\nFirst, we know that each ticket costs $4 and the total value of tickets sold over three days is $960. To find the total number of tickets sold, we divide the total value by the price per ticket:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of tickets} = \\frac{\\text{Total value of tickets}}{\\text{Price per ticket}} = \\frac{960}{4} = 240\n\\]\n\nSo, Carol sold a total of 240 tickets over the three days. To find the average number of tickets sold per day, we divide the total number of tickets by the number of days:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average number of tickets per day} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of tickets}}{\\text{Number of days}} = \\frac{240}{3} = 80\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of tickets Carol sold during one of these three days is \\boxed{80}.",

Therefore, the total number of tickets sold is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of tickets} = \\frac{\\text{Total value of tickets}}{\\text{Cost per ticket}} = \\frac{960}{4} = 240\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the average number of tickets sold per day. Since the total number of tickets sold is 240 and this occurred over 3 days, the average number of tickets sold per day is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average number of tickets per day} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of tickets}}{\\text{Number of days}} = \\frac{240}{3} = 80\n\\]\n\nThus, the average number of tickets Carol sold per day is \\boxed{80}.",
