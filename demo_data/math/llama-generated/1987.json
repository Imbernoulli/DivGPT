        "To determine how many sandwiches Paul eats over 6 days, we first need to understand his eating pattern. Paul eats sandwiches at a rate that repeats every three days. Let's break it down day by day:\n\n1. On the first day, Paul eats 2 sandwiches.\n2. On the second day, Paul eats double the number of sandwiches he ate on the first day, which is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) sandwiches.\n3. On the third day, Paul eats double the number of sandwiches he ate on the second day, which is \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) sandwiches.\n\nThis pattern repeats every three days. Therefore, over a 6-day period, we can see that the pattern will repeat twice. Let's calculate the total number of sandwiches Paul eats over these 6 days:\n\n- For the first three days, Paul eats \\(2 + 4 + 8 = 14\\) sandwiches.\n- For the next three days, Paul eats another \\(2 + 4 + 8 = 14\\) sandwiches.\n\nAdding these together, the total number of sandwiches Paul eats over 6 days is \\(14 + 14 = 28\\).\n\nThus, the total number of sandwiches Paul would eat if he studied 6 days in a row is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
