        "To determine the total number of jellybeans Caleb and Sophie have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of jellybeans Caleb has.\n2. Calculate the number of jellybeans Sophie has.\n3. Add the number of jellybeans Caleb has to the number of jellybeans Sophie has.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many jellybeans Caleb has. Caleb has 3 dozen jellybeans. Since one dozen equals 12 jellybeans, we can calculate the total number of jellybeans Caleb has as follows:\n\\[ 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many jellybeans Sophie has. Sophie has half as many jellybeans as Caleb. Therefore, we can calculate the number of jellybeans Sophie has as follows:\n\\[ \\frac{36}{2} = 18 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of jellybeans Caleb has to the number of jellybeans Sophie has to find the total number of jellybeans they have together:\n\\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of jellybeans Caleb and Sophie have is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",

Caleb has 3 dozen jellybeans. Since one dozen equals 12, we can find the total number of jellybeans Caleb has by multiplying 3 by 12:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\]\n\nSo, Caleb has 36 jellybeans.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of jellybeans Sophie has. Sophie has half as many jellybeans as Caleb. Since Caleb has 36 jellybeans, we can find the total number of jellybeans Sophie has by dividing 36 by 2:\n\n\\[ 36 \\div 2 = 18 \\]\n\nSo, Sophie has 18 jellybeans.\n\nNow, we add the number of jellybeans Caleb and Sophie have together:\n\n\\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of jellybeans Caleb and Sophie have is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
