Since each employee makes an average of 20 shirts per day, the daily payment for shirts made by each employee is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ shirts} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/shirt} = 100 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nTherefore, the total daily payment for shirts made by all the employees is:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ employees} \\times 100 \\text{ dollars/employee} = 2000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nAdding the total daily wage and the total daily payment for shirts made by the employees gives the total labor cost:\n\\[\n1920 \\text{ dollars} + 2000 \\text{ dollars} = 3920 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nThe nonemployee expenses are given as $1000 per day. Therefore, the total daily cost is:\n\\[\n3920 \\text{ dollars} + 1000 \\text{ dollars} = 4920 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, the company's daily profit is the total daily revenue minus the total daily cost:\n\\[\n14000 \\text{ dollars} - 4920 \\text{ dollars} = 9080 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the company makes a profit of \\(\\boxed{9080}\\) dollars per day.",
