        "To determine how many feet further down Jack is than when he started, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total height Jack goes up:**\n   - Jack goes up 3 flights of stairs.\n   - Each flight has 12 steps.\n   - Each step is 8 inches high.\n   - Therefore, the height of one flight is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ steps} \\times 8 \\text{ inches/step} = 96 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n   - The total height Jack goes up is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ flights} \\times 96 \\text{ inches/flight} = 288 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total height Jack goes down:**\n   - Jack goes down 6 flights of stairs.\n   - Each flight has 12 steps.\n   - Each step is 8 inches high.\n   - Therefore, the height of one flight is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ steps} \\times 8 \\text{ inches/step} = 96 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n   - The total height Jack goes down is:\n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ flights} \\times 96 \\text{ inches/flight} = 576 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the net change in height:**\n   - Jack goes up 288 inches and down 576 inches.\n   - The net change in height is:\n     \\[\n     288 \\text{ inches} - 576 \\text{ inches} = -288 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n   - The negative sign indicates that Jack is further down than when he started.\n\n4. **Convert the net change in height from inches to feet:**\n   - There are 12 inches in a foot.\n   - Therefore, the net change in feet is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-288 \\text{ inches}}{12 \\text{ inches/foot}} = -24 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Jack is \\(\\boxed{24}\\) feet further down than when he started.",
