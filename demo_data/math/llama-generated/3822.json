Calculate the total cost for 10 pairs of pants at the discounted price.\n3. Calculate the total cost after adding a 10% tax.\n\nFirst, we calculate the discounted price of one pair of pants. The original price of each pair is $45, and there is a 20% discount. The discount amount for one pair is:\n\\[ 45 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 45 \\times 0.20 = 9 \\]\nSo, the discounted price of one pair of pants is:\n\\[ 45 - 9 = 36 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for 10 pairs of pants at the discounted price:\n\\[ 10 \\times 36 = 360 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total cost after adding a 10% tax. The tax amount for the total cost is:\n\\[ 360 \\times \\frac{10}{100} = 360 \\times 0.10 = 36 \\]\nSo, the total cost after tax is:\n\\[ 360 + 36 = 396 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jean will need to pay \\(\\boxed{396}\\) dollars for all of the pants after the discount and tax.",
