        "To determine how many senior students did not get any scholarships, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of senior students who got a full merit scholarship.\n2. Calculate the number of senior students who got a half merit scholarship.\n3. Add the number of students who got full merit scholarships and half merit scholarships.\n4. Subtract the total number of students who got scholarships from the total number of senior students.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the number of senior students who got a full merit scholarship:\n   \\[\n   5\\% \\text{ of } 300 = \\frac{5}{100} \\times 300 = 0.05 \\times 300 = 15\n   \\]\n\n2.

Add the number of students who got full merit scholarships and half merit scholarships:\n   \\[\n   15 + 30 = 45\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract the total number of students who got scholarships from the total number of senior students:\n   \\[\n   300 - 45 = 255\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of senior students who did not get any scholarships is \\boxed{255}.",

Ten percent of the 300 senior students got a half merit scholarship:\n\\[\n0.10 \\times 300 = 30\n\\]\nSo, 30 senior students got a half merit scholarship.\n\nNow, we add the number of students who got a full merit scholarship and the number of students who got a half merit scholarship to find the total number of students who received any scholarships:\n\\[\n15 + 30 = 45\n\\]\nSo, 45 senior students received any scholarships.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of students who received any scholarships from the total number of senior students to find the number of students who did not get any scholarships:\n\\[\n300 - 45 = 255\n\\]\nSo, the number of senior students who did not get any scholarships is \\boxed{255}.",
        "To determine how many senior students did not get any scholarships, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of students who received a full merit scholarship:**\n   - We know that 5% of the 300 senior students got a full merit scholarship.\n   - First, convert the percentage to a decimal: \\(5\\% = 0.05\\).\n   - Multiply the total number of students by the decimal: \\(0.05 \\times 300\\).\n   \\[\n   0.05 \\times 300 = 15\n   \\]\n   So, 15 students received a full merit scholarship.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of students who received a half merit scholarship:**\n   - We know that 10% of the 300 senior students got a half merit scholarship.\n   - First, convert the percentage to a decimal: \\(10\\% = 0.10\\).\n   - Multiply the total number of students by the decimal: \\(0.10 \\times 300\\).\n   \\[\n   0.10 \\times 300 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, 30 students received a half merit scholarship.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of students who received any scholarship:**\n   - Add the number of students who received a full merit scholarship to the number of students who received a half merit scholarship.\n   \\[\n   15 + 30 = 45\n   \\]\n   So, 45 students received some type of scholarship.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of students who did not receive any scholarships:**\n   - Subtract the total number of students who received any scholarship from the total number of senior students.\n   \\[\n   300 - 45 = 255\n   \\]\n   So, 255 students did not get any scholarships.\n\nTherefore, the number of senior students who did not get any scholarships is \\(\\boxed{255}\\).",

Subtract the sum of these two groups from the total number of senior students to find out how many did not receive any scholarships.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of senior students who received a full merit scholarship. Five percent of the 300 senior students got a full merit scholarship:\n\\[\n0.05 \\times 300 = 15\n\\]\nSo, 15 senior students received a full merit scholarship.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of senior students who received a half merit scholarship.
