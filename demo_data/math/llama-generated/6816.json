        "To determine the number of female brunettes in Dana's senior high school class who are under 5 feet tall, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of female students in the class.\n2. Determine the number of female brunettes.\n3. Find out how many of these female brunettes are under 5 feet tall.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of female students. Since 60% of the 200 students are female, we have:\n\\[\n0.60 \\times 200 = 120\n\\]\nSo, there are 120 female students.\n\nNext, we determine the number of female brunettes. Since 50% of the female students are brunettes, we have:\n\\[\n0.50 \\times 120 = 60\n\\]\nSo, there are 60 female brunettes.\n\nFinally, we find out how many of these female brunettes are under 5 feet tall. Since 50% of the female brunettes are under 5 feet tall, we have:\n\\[\n0.50 \\times 60 = 30\n\\]\nSo, the number of female brunettes in Dana's high school senior class who are under 5 feet tall is \\boxed{30}.",
