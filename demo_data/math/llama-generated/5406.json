        "To determine the total weight of the lorry when it is loaded with 20 bags of apples, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of the apples.\n2. Add the weight of the apples to the weight of the empty lorry.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of the apples. Each bag of apples weighs 60 pounds, and there are 20 bags. So, we multiply the weight of one bag by the number of bags:\n\n\\[ 60 \\text{ pounds/bag} \\times 20 \\text{ bags} = 1200 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we add the weight of the apples to the weight of the empty lorry.

Add the weight of the apples to the weight of the empty lorry.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of the apples. Since each bag of apples weighs 60 pounds and there are 20 bags, we multiply the weight of one bag by the number of bags:\n\\[\n60 \\text{ pounds/bag} \\times 20 \\text{ bags} = 1200 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the weight of the apples to the weight of the empty lorry. The empty lorry weighs 500 pounds, so we add 1200 pounds to 500 pounds:\n\\[\n500 \\text{ pounds} + 1200 \\text{ pounds} = 1700 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the lorry when it is loaded with 20 bags of apples is \\boxed{1700} pounds.",
