        "To determine the number of grey cats in the house, we start by calculating the number of black cats. Since 25% of the 16 cats are black, we perform the following calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of black cats} = 0.25 \\times 16 = 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that there are 2 white cats. Therefore, the total number of white and black cats combined is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of white and black cats} = 2 + 4 = 6\n\\]\n\nSince the total number of cats in the house is 16, the number of grey cats is the total number of cats minus the number of white and black cats:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of grey cats} = 16 - 6 = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of grey cats in the house is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
