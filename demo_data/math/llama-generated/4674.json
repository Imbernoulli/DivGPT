        "To determine how many pencils Elizabeth can buy with her 20 dollars if she wants 6 pens, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the 6 pens.\n2. Subtract the total cost of the pens from Elizabeth's total amount of money to find out how much money she has left.\n3. Determine how many pencils she can buy with the remaining money.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of one pen is $2, so the cost of 6 pens is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 2 = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. Elizabeth has $20 initially. After buying 6 pens, she will have:\n   \\[\n   20 - 12 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. The cost of one pencil is $1.60, so the number of pencils she can buy with the remaining $8 is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8}{1.60} = 5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Elizabeth can buy \\(\\boxed{5}\\) pencils.",
