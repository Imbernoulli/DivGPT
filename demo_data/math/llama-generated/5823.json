So, we perform the following calculations:\n\nFirst, subtract the amount sold to Mrs. Maxwell from the total amount harvested:\n\\[ 245.5 \\, \\text{kg} - 125.5 \\, \\text{kg} = 120 \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nNext, subtract the amount sold to Mr. Wilson from the remaining amount:\n\\[ 120 \\, \\text{kg} - 78 \\, \\text{kg} = 42 \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of kilograms of tomatoes that are not sold is \\(\\boxed{42}\\).",
        "To determine how many kilograms of tomatoes Mr. Alonzo has not sold, we need to subtract the total weight of the tomatoes he sold from the total weight of the tomatoes he harvested.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of the tomatoes sold:\n- Mr. Alonzo sold 125.5 kg to Mrs. Maxwell.\n- Mr. Alonzo sold 78 kg to Mr. Wilson.\n\nAdding these amounts together:\n\\[ 125.5 \\, \\text{kg} + 78 \\, \\text{kg} = 203.5 \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total weight of the tomatoes sold from the total weight of the tomatoes harvested:\n- Mr. Alonzo harvested 245.5 kg.\n- Mr. Alonzo sold 203.5 kg.\n\nSubtracting these amounts:\n\\[ 245.5 \\, \\text{kg} - 203.5 \\, \\text{kg} = 42 \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of kilograms of tomatoes that are not sold is \\boxed{42}.",
