        "To determine how much Tom will have to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the doctor's visit, apply the insurance coverage, and then add the cost of the trip. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the vaccines:**\n   Tom needs 10 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $45.\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 45 = 450\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the vaccines is $450.\n\n2. **Add the cost of the doctor's visit:**\n   The doctor's visit costs $250.\n   \\[\n   450 + 250 = 700\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the vaccines and the doctor's visit is $700.\n\n3. **Apply the insurance coverage:**\n   Insurance will cover 80% of the medical bills.\n   \\[\n   0.80 \\times 700 = 560\n   \\]\n   So, the insurance will cover $560 of the medical bills.
