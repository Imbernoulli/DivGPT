One day, they followed him to the farm, each one with a bag to collect harvested apples. At the end of the day, each bag was filled with 15 apples each. On their way back home, 2 of the children have eaten 4 apples each and another child sold 7 of his apples. If they had a total of 60 apples left by the time they got home, how many children does the farmer have?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
