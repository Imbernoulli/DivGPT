        "To determine how much more money Lilith will need to buy her friend's birthday gift after selling her water bottles at the reduced cost, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of water bottles Lilith has.\n2. Determine the total amount of money Lilith would have if she sold all the water bottles at the original price.\n3. Determine the total amount of money Lilith will have if she sells all the water bottles at the reduced price.\n4. Calculate the difference between the original total and the reduced total to find out how much more money she needs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Lilith has. She originally had five dozen water bottles. Since one dozen equals 12, we have:\n\\[\n5 \\times 12 = 60\n\\]\nSo, Lilith has 60 water bottles.\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of money Lilith would have if she sold all the water bottles at the original price of $2 each:\n\\[\n60 \\times 2 = 120\n\\]\nSo, she would have $120 if she sold them at $2 each.\n\nNow, we calculate the total amount of money Lilith will have if she sells all the water bottles at the reduced price of $1.85 each:\n\\[\n60 \\times 1.85 = 111\n\\]\nSo, she will have $111 if she sold them at $1.85 each.\n\nFinally, we find out how much more money Lilith needs by subtracting the amount she will have at the reduced price from the amount she would have at the original price:\n\\[\n120 - 111 = 9\n\\]\nSo, Lilith will have to find \\(\\boxed{9}\\) dollars to buy her friend's birthday gift.",

Calculate the total amount of money Lilith will receive if she sells all the water bottles at the reduced price.\n4. Find the difference between the amount she needs and the amount she will receive after the price reduction.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of water bottles Lilith originally had.**\n\nLilith originally had five dozen water bottles.

Therefore, the total amount of money she would have received is:\n\\[ 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Lilith will receive if she sells all the water bottles at the reduced price.**\n\nThe reduced price of each water bottle is $1.85. Therefore, the total amount of money she will receive is:\n\\[ 60 \\times 1.85 = 111 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the difference between the amount she needs and the amount she will receive after the price reduction.**\n\nThe amount of money Lilith needs is $120, and the amount she will receive is $111. Therefore, the difference is:\n\\[ 120 - 111 = 9 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift after selling her water bottles at the reduced cost is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
        "First, we calculate the total number of water bottles Lilith originally had. Since she had five dozen water bottles, we multiply:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 12 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of money Lilith would have if she sold all the water bottles at the original price of $2 each. We multiply the number of water bottles by the original price:\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\]\n\nThis means Lilith would have $120 if she sold the water bottles at $2 each. However, she has to sell them at the reduced price of $1.85 each. We calculate the total amount of money she will have after selling all the water bottles at the reduced price:\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 1.85 = 111 \\]\n\nNow, we find out how much more money Lilith needs to buy her friend the birthday gift.
