        "To determine the cost for Holly to plant a row of trees along her fence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the length of the fence from yards to feet.\n2. Calculate the number of trees needed to cover the length of the fence.\n3. Determine the total cost of the trees.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the length of the fence from yards to feet.**\n\nHolly's fence is 25 yards long. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, we can convert the length as follows:\n\\[ 25 \\text{ yards} \\times 3 \\text{ feet/yard} = 75 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of trees needed to cover the length of the fence.**\n\nEach tree is 1.5 feet wide. To find out how many trees are needed to cover 75 feet, we divide the total length of the fence by the width of each tree:\n\\[ 75 \\text{ feet} \\div 1.5 \\text{ feet/tree} = 50 \\text{ trees} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total cost of the trees.**\n\nEach tree costs $8.00. Therefore, the total cost for 50 trees is:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ trees} \\times 8 \\text{ dollars/tree} = 400 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the total cost for Holly to plant a row of trees to run the length of her fence is \\(\\boxed{400}\\).",
