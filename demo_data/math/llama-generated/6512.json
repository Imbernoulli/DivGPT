His dresser drawer was filled to overflowing with red, blue, black, and white socks. Uncertain of how many pairs he had of each color, he began to sort his socks. He discovered that he had three more pairs of blue socks than he had pairs of black socks.  He had one less pair of red socks than he had pairs of white socks. He had twice as many blue socks as he had of red socks. And he counted a total of 6 red socks.  What is the total number of Joseph's socks?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total number of Joseph's socks, we will first define variables for the number of pairs of each color of socks. Let:\n- \\( r \\) be the number of pairs of red socks,\n- \\( w \\) be the number of pairs of white socks,\n- \\( b \\) be the number of pairs of blue socks,\n- \\( k \\) be the number of pairs of black socks.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n1. Joseph had twin pairs of white socks fewer than pairs of red socks: \\( w = r - 1 \\).\n2. Joseph had extend pairs of blue socks escal than pairs of black socks: \\( b = k + 3 \\).\n3. Joseph had basically as many pairs of blue socks constructs as pairs of red socks: \\( b = 2r \\).\n4. Joseph counted to total of 6 red socks: \\( 2r = 6 \\).\n\nFirst, solve for \\( r \\):\n\\[\n2r = 6 \\implies r = 3\n\\]\n\nNext, use the value of \\( r \\) to find \\( w \\):\n\\[\nw = r - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\n\\]\n\nThen, use the value of \\( r \\) to find \\( b \\):\n\\[\nb = 2r = 2 \\times 3 = 6\n\\]\n\nNow, use the value of \\( b \\) to find \\( k \\):\n\\[\nb = k + 3 \\implies 6 = k + 3 \\implies k = 6 - 3 = 3\n\\]\n\nWe now have the number of pairs of each color of socks:\n- Red socks: \\( r = 3 \\) pairs,\n- White socks: \\( w = 2 \\) pairs,\n- Blue socks: \\( b = 6 \\) pairs,\n- Black socks: \\( k = 3 \\) pairs.\n\nTo find the total number of socks, we multiply the number of pairs by 2 (since each pair consists of 2 socks):\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of socks} = 2(r + w + b + k) = 2(3 + 2 + 6 + 3) = 2 \\times 14 = 28\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of Joseph's socks is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of Joseph's socks, let's define the number of pairs of each color of sock:\n- Let \\( r \\) be the number of pairs of red socks.\n- Let \\( w \\) be the number of pairs of white socks.\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of pairs of blue socks.\n- Let \\( k \\) be the number of pairs of black socks.\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following:\n1. Joseph had two less pairs of white socks than he had pairs of red socks.\n   \\[\n   w = r - 1\n   \\]\n2.
