So, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ pizzas} \\times 12 \\text{ slices per pizza} = 48 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of slices eaten by the guests from the total number of slices. The guests ate 39 slices, so we subtract 39 from 48:\n\\[ 48 \\text{ slices} - 39 \\text{ slices} = 9 \\text{ slices} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of slices left is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
