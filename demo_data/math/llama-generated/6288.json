        "To determine the total cost of the sunscreen after the discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bottles Juanita needs for the year.\n2. Determine the total cost of the bottles before the discount.\n3. Calculate the discount amount.\n4. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of bottles Juanita needs for the year:**\n   Juanita goes through 1 bottle of sunscreen each month. Therefore, for 12 months, she needs:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total cost of the bottles before the discount:**\n   Each bottle costs $30.00. So, the total cost for 12 bottles is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 30 = 360 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the discount amount:**\n   The website offers a 30% discount on the entire purchase. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost before the discount by 30% (or 0.30):\n   \\[\n   360 \\times 0.30 = 108 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount:**\n   To find the total cost after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount:\n   \\[\n   360 - 108 = 252 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of all the sunscreen after the discount is \\(\\boxed{252}\\).",
