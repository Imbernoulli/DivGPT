The normal monthly price of the plan is $500, so the government subsidy is:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 0.50 = 250 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Bill's monthly out-of-pocket cost.**\n\nBill's monthly out-of-pocket cost is the normal monthly price minus the government subsidy:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ dollars/month} - 250 \\text{ dollars/month} = 250 \\text{ dollars/month} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Bill's annual out-of-pocket cost.**\n\nBill's annual out-of-pocket cost is his monthly out-of-pocket cost multiplied by 12:\n\\[ 250 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 3000 \\text{ dollars/year} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Bill will spend for health insurance in a year is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3000} \\]",
        "To determine how much Bill will spend on health insurance in a year, we first need to calculate his annual income. Bill earns $25 per hour and works 30 hours per week, four weeks per month. Therefore, his monthly income is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n25 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 30 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 3000 \\text{ dollars/month}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate his annual income by multiplying his monthly income by 12:\n\n\\[\n3000 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 36000 \\text{ dollars/year}\n\\]\n\nSince Bill's annual income is $36,000, which falls between $10,001 and $40,000, the government will pay 50% of the cost of the health insurance plan. The normal monthly price of the plan is $500, so the government's contribution each month is:\n\n\\[\n500 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 0.50 = 250 \\text{ dollars/month}\n\\]\n\nThis means Bill pays the remaining 50% of the monthly cost, which is:\n\n\\[\n500 \\text{ dollars/month} - 250 \\text{ dollars/month} = 250 \\text{ dollars/month}\n\\]\n\nTo find out how much Bill spends on health insurance in a year, we multiply his monthly payment by 12:\n\n\\[\n250 \\text{ dollars/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 3000 \\text{ dollars/year}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Bill will spend \\(\\boxed{3000}\\) dollars for health insurance in a year.",
        "To determine how much Bill will spend on health insurance in a year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Bill's weekly earnings:**\n   Bill earns $25 per hour and works 30 hours per week.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly earnings} = 25 \\, \\text{dollars/hour} \\times 30 \\, \\text{hours/week} = 750 \\, \\text{dollars/week}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Bill's monthly earnings:**\n   Bill works 4 weeks per month.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly earnings} = 750 \\, \\text{dollars/week} \\times 4 \\, \\text{weeks/month} = 3000 \\, \\text{dollars/month}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Bill's annual income:**\n   Bill works 12 months per year.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual earnings} = 3000 \\, \\text{dollars/month} \\times 12 \\, \\text{months/year} = 36000 \\, \\text{dollars/year}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Identify the government contribution based on Bill's income:**\n   Bill's annual income is $36,000, which falls between $10,001 and $40,000. According to the given table, the government will pay 50% of the health insurance cost.\n\n5. **Calculate the government's contribution:**\n   The normal monthly price of the plan is $500.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Government's monthly contribution} = 0.50 \\times 500 \\, \\text{dollars} = 250 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate Bill's monthly out-of-pocket cost:**\n   Subtract the government's contribution from the normal monthly price.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bill's monthly out-of-pocket cost} = 500 \\, \\text{dollars} - 250 \\, \\text{dollars} = 250 \\, \\text{dollars}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate Bill's annual out-of-pocket cost:**\n   Multiply Bill's monthly out-of-pocket cost by 12 months.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bill's annual out-of-pocket cost} = 250 \\, \\text{dollars/month} \\times 12 \\, \\text{months/year} = 3000 \\, \\text{dollars/year}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Bill will spend \\(\\boxed{3000}\\) dollars for health insurance in a year.",

        "First, we need to calculate Bill's monthly income. Bill earns $25 per hour and works 30 hours per week, so his weekly income is:\n\\[\n25 \\times 30 = 750 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nSince he works 4 weeks per month, his monthly income is:\n\\[\n750 \\times 4 = 3000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nNext, we need to determine the government subsidy based on Bill's income. Since Bill's monthly income is $3000, which falls between $10,001 and $40,000, the government will pay 50% of the healthcare cost. The normal monthly price of the plan is $500, so the government subsidy is:\n\\[\n0.50 \\times 500 = 250 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nThis means Bill pays:\n\\[\n500 - 250 = 250 \\text{ dollars per month}\n\\]\nTo find out how much Bill will spend for health insurance in a year, we multiply his monthly payment by 12:\n\\[\n250 \\times 12 = 3000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nTherefore, the amount Bill will spend for health insurance in a year is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3000}\n\\]"
