        "To determine how much speed Jon gained per week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Jon's final fastball speed after training:**\n   Jon starts with a fastball speed of 80 miles per hour. After completed training, he can throw the ball 20% faster.\n   \\[\n   20\\% \\text{ of } 80 = 0.20 \\times 80 = 16 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, his final fastball speed is:\n   \\[\n   80 + 16 = 96 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total speed gain:**\n   Jon's speed gain is the difference between his final speed and his initial speed:\n   \\[\n   96 - 80 = 16 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of weeks of training:**\n Jon goes through intense training 4 times, and each session lasts 4 weeks.\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ sessions} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks per session} = 16 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the speed gain per week:**\n   To find the speed gain per week, divide the total speed gain by the total number of weeks:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{16 \\text{ miles per hour}}{16 \\text{ weeks}} = 1 \\text{ mile per hour per week}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Jon gained \\(\\boxed{1}\\) mile per hour per week.",
