        "To determine the total number of rainbow nerds in the box, we need to calculate the number of each color of candy and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Purple Candies:**\n   The box contains 10 purple candies.\n\n2. **Yellow Candies:**\n   The box contains 4 more yellow candies than purple candies. Therefore, we add 4 to the number of purple candies:\n   \\[\n   10 + 4 = 14\n   \\]\n   So, there are 14 yellow candies.\n\n3. **Green Candies:**\n   The box contains 2 fewer green candies than yellow candies. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of yellow candies:\n   \\[\n   14 - 2 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, there are 12 green candies.\n\n4. **Total Number of Candies:**\n   To find the total number of rainbow nerds, we add the number of purple, yellow, and green candies together:\n   \\[\n   10 + 14 + 12 = 36\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of rainbow nerds in the box is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
