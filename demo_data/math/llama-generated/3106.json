        "To determine the total space taken up by the cans after being compacted, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the space taken up by one can after being compacted.\n2. Multiply the space taken up by one compacted can by the total number of cans.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much space one can takes up after being compacted. Each can originally takes up 30 square inches of space. After being compacted, it takes up 20% of its original space. So, we calculate 20% of 30 square inches:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 30 = 6 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out the total space taken up by all 60 compacted cans. Since each compacted can takes up 6 square inches, we multiply 6 square inches by 60:\n\\[\n6 \\times 60 = 360 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total space taken up by all the cans after being compacted is \\boxed{360} square inches.",

We do this by multiplying the space taken up by one compacted can by the total number of cans:\n\\[\n60 \\times 6 = 360 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\nTherefore, the total space taken up by all the cans after being compacted is \\boxed{360} square inches.",
