        "To determine how many more times a week Susannah swam than Camden, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the weekly swimming frequency for Camden:**\n   Camden went swimming 16 times in March. Since March has 4 weeks, we divide the total number of times he swam by the number of weeks:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{16 \\text{ times}}{4 \\text{ weeks}} = 4 \\text{ times per week}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the weekly swimming frequency for Susannah:**\n   Susannah went swimming 24 times in March.
