        "To determine how many years older Zion's dad is than Zion in 10 years, we start by finding their current ages and then calculate their ages in 10 years.\n\nFirst, we know Zion is currently 8 years old. According to the problem, Zion's dad is 3 more than 4 times Zion's age. We can express this mathematically as:\n\\[\n\\text{Dad's current age} = 4 \\times \\text{Zion's current age} + 3\n\\]\nSubstituting Zion's current age into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Dad's current age} = 4 \\times 8 + 3 = 32 + 3 = 35\n\\]\nSo, Zion's dad is currently 35 years old.\n\nNext, we calculate their ages in 10 years. In 10 years, Zion will be:\n\\[\n\\text{Zion's age in 10 years} = 8 + 10 = 18\n\\]\nAnd in 10 years, Zion's dad will be:\n\\[\n\\text{Dad's age in 10 years} = 35 + 10 = 45\n\\]\nTo find out how many years older Zion's dad is than Zion in 10 years, we subtract Zion's age in 10 years from his dad's age in 10 years:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in age} = 45 - 18 = 27\n\\]\nTherefore, in 10 years, Zion's dad will be \\boxed{27} years older than Zion.",

So, we can write the equation for Zion's dad's current age as:\n\\[ \\text{Dad's current age} = 4 \\times 8 + 3 = 32 + 3 = 35 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how old Zion's dad will be in 10 years. Since his current age is 35, in 10 years he will be:\n\\[ \\text{Dad's age in 10 years} = 35 + 10 = 45 \\]\n\nSimilarly, we need to find out how old Zion will be in 10 years. Since he is currently 8, in 10 years he will be:\n\\[ \\text{Zion's age in 10 years} = 8 + 10 = 18 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between Zion's dad's age and Zion's age in 10 years:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 45 - 18 = 27 \\]\n\nTherefore, in 10 years, Zion's dad will be \\(\\boxed{27}\\) years older than Zion.",
