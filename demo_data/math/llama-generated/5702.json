        "To determine how much money third place gets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money in the pot.\n2. Determine how much money first place gets.\n3. Determine how much money second and third place get together.\n4. Determine how much money third place gets.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of money in the pot. Since there are 8 people (Josh and his 7 friends) and each person puts in 5 dollars, the total amount of money is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 5 = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how much money first place gets. First place gets 80% of the total money, so:\n\\[\n0.80 \\times 40 = 32 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThen, we determine how much money second and third place get together. Since first place gets 32 dollars, the remaining money is:\n\\[\n40 - 32 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we determine how much money third place gets. Since second and third place split the remaining 8 dollars equally, third place gets:\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money third place gets is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
