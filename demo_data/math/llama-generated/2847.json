Since the towers were located at 5 kilometer intervals, they could send a signal the length of the Great Wall.  If the Great wall was 7300 kilometers long, and every tower had two soldiers, what was the combined number of soldiers in beacon towers on the Great Wall?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the combined number of soldiers in beacon towers along the Great Wall, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of beacon towers along the Great Wall.\n2. Determine the total number of soldiers based on the number of towers.\n\nFirst, we find the number of beacon towers. The Great Wall is 7300 kilometers long, and the beacon towers are positioned at 5 kilometer intervals. This means we need to divide the total length of the Great Wall by the distance between each pair of towers:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7300 \\text{ km}}{5 \\text{ km/tower}} = 1460 \\text{ towers}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that each tower has 2 soldiers. Therefore, the total number of soldiers is the number of towers multiplied by the number of soldiers per tower:\n\n\\[\n1460 \\text{ towers} \\times 2 \\text{ soldiers/tower} = 2920 \\text{ soldiers}\n\\]\n\nThus, the combined number of soldiers in beacon towers on the Great Wall is \\(\\boxed{2920}\\).",
