        "To determine how much money Jackson has, we start by defining the amount of money Williams has as \\( W \\). According to the problem, Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams, so Jackson's amount of money can be expressed as \\( 5W \\).\n\nThe total amount of money that Jackson and Williams have together is given as $150. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ W + 5W = 150 \\]\n\nCombining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 6W = 150 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( W \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\\[ W = \\frac{150}{6} = 25 \\]\n\nSo, Williams has $25. Since Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams, we calculate Jackson's amount of money as follows:\n\\[ 5W = 5 \\times 25 = 125 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jackson has \\(\\boxed{125}\\) dollars.",
