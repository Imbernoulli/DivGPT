Calculate the total number of legs that Camden's dogs have.\n\nFirst, we know that Justin has 14 dogs. Rico has 10 more dogs than Justin, so we calculate the number of dogs Rico has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of dogs Rico has} = 14 + 10 = 24\n\\]\n\nNext, Camden has \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) times as many dogs as Rico. So, we calculate the number of dogs Camden has as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of dogs Camden has} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 24 = 18\n\\]\n\nEach dog has 4 legs, so the total number of legs that Camden's dogs have is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of legs} = 18 \\times 4 = 72\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs that Camden's dogs have is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).",
