        "To determine the number of birds on the fence, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of birds on the fence by \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, ten more than twice the number of birds on the fence is 50. This can be written as:\n\\[ 2x + 10 = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve this equation for \\( x \\). First, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2x + 10 - 10 = 50 - 10 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 40 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[ \\frac{2x}{2} = \\frac{40}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of birds on the fence is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
