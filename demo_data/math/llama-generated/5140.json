        "To determine the total number of marshmallows Joe and his dad roasted, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of marshmallows Joe has.\n2. Determine how many marshmallows Joe's dad roasts.\n3. Determine how many marshmallows Joe roasts.\n4. Add the number of marshmallows roasted by Joe and his dad.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of marshmallows Joe has. Joe has four times as many marshmallows as his dad. Since Joe's dad has 21 marshmallows, we multiply 21 by 4:\n\\[\n21 \\times 4 = 84\n\\]\nSo, Joe has 84 marshmallows.\n\nNext, we determine how many marshmallows Joe's dad roasts. Joe's dad roasts a third of his marshmallows. Since Joe's dad has 21 marshmallows, we divide 21 by 3:\n\\[\n21 \\div 3 = 7\n\\]\nSo, Joe's dad roasts 7 marshmallows.\n\nThen, we determine how many marshmallows Joe roasts. Joe roasts half of his marshmallows. Since Joe has 84 marshmallows, we divide 84 by 2:\n\\[\n84 \\div 2 = 42\n\\]\nSo, Joe roasts 42 marshmallows.\n\nFinally, we add the number of marshmallows roasted by Joe and his dad:\n\\[\n7 + 42 = 49\n\\]\nSo, the total number of marshmallows they roasted is \\boxed{49}.",
