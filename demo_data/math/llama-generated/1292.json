        "To determine the total number of beads Kylie uses to make her jewelry, we need to calculate the number of beads used for each type of jewelry separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of beads used for the necklaces:\n- Kylie makes 10 beaded necklaces on Monday and 2 beaded necklaces on Tuesday, so the total number of necklaces is:\n  \\[\n  10 + 2 = 12\n  \\]\n- Since each necklace requires 20 beads, the total number of beads used for the necklaces is:\n  \\[\n  12 \\times 20 = 240\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of beads used for the bracelets:\n- Kylie makes 5 beaded bracelets on Wednesday, so the total number of bracelets is:\n  \\[\n  5\n  \\]\n- Since each bracelet requires 10 beads, the total number of beads used for the bracelets is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 10 = 50\n  \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the number of beads used for the earrings:\n- Kylie makes 7 beaded earrings on Wednesday, so the total number of earrings is:\n  \\[\n  7\n  \\]\n- Since each earring requires 5 beads, the total number of beads used for the earrings is:\n  \\[\n  7 \\times 5 = 35\n  \\]\n\nFinally, we sum up the beads used for all the jewelry:\n\\[\n240 + 50 + 35 = 325\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of beads Kylie uses to make her jewelry is \\boxed{325}.",
