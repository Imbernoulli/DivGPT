        "To determine how many hours a week Tim runs now, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\n1. Calculate the new number of days Tim runs per week.\n2. Determine the total number of hours she runs each day.\n3. Multiply the number of days she runs by the number of hours she runs each day.\n\nFirst, we know that Tim used to run 3 times a week and decided to add an extra 2 days a week. Therefore, the new number of days she runs per week is:\n\\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \\]\n\nNext, we know that she runs 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening each day she runs. So, the total number of hours she runs each day is:\n\\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \\]\n\nNow, we multiply the number of days she runs by the number of hours she runs each day to find the total number of hours she runs per week:\n\\[ 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Tim runs now each week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",
