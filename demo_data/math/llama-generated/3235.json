Each of the 30 students is assigned to a separate group and will need to take markers from the 22 boxes of markers. The first group has 10 students who will have 2 markers each and the second group has 15 students who will have 4 markers each. The last group takes the remaining markers and divides them equally. If each box of markers contains 5 markers, how many markers does each of the students in the last group receive?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many markers each student in the last group receives, we start by calculating the total number of markers available. Since each box contains 5 markers and there are 22 boxes, the total number of markers is:\n\\[\n22 \\times 5 = 110\n\\]\nNext, we calculate the number of markers used by the first group. The first group has 10 students, and each student gets 2 markers, so the total number of markers used by the first group is:\n\\[\n10 \\times 2 = 20\n\\]\nThen, we calculate the number of markers used by the second group. The second group has 15 students, and each student gets 4 markers, so the total number of markers used by the second group is:\n\\[\n15 \\times 4 = 60\n\\]\nNow, we find out how many markers are left after the first and second groups have taken their markers. The total number of markers used by both groups is:\n\\[\n20 + 60 = 80\n\\]\nSubtracting this from the total number of markers gives us the number of markers left for the last group:\n\\[\n110 - 80 = 30\n\\]\nThe last group consists of the remaining students, which is:\n\\[\n30 - 10 - 15 = 5\n\\]\nSince the last group takes the remaining 30 markers and divides them equally among the 5 students, each student in the last group receives:\n\\[\n30 \\div 5 = 6\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of markers each student in the last group receives is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",

Determine the total number of markers used by the first and second groups.\n   - The first group has 10 students, and each student gets 2 markers.\n   - Therefore, the total number of markers used by the first group is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 2 = 20\n     \\]\n   - The second group has 15 students, and each student gets 4 markers.\n   - Therefore, the total number of markers used by the second group is:\n     \\[\n     15 \\times 4 = 60\n     \\]\n   - Adding the markers used by both groups gives:\n     \\[\n     20 + 60 = 80\n     \\]\n\n3. Subtract the markers used by the first and second groups from the total number of markers to find out how many markers are left for the last group.\n   - The total number of markers is 110.\n   - The number of markers used by the first and second groups is 80.\n   - Therefore, the number of markers left for the last group is:\n     \\[\n     110 - 80 = 30\n     \\]\n\n4. Divide the remaining markers equally among the students in the last group.\n   - The last group has 30 - 10 - 15 = 5 students.\n   - Therefore, the number of markers each student in the last group receives is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{30}{5} = 6\n     \\]\n\nThus, each of the students in the last group receives \\(\\boxed{6}\\) markers.",
