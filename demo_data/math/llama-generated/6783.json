They are stored in boxes and inside the boxes, they are stacked 5 rows high with 4 cups in each row. Of the 26 boxes in her attic, 6 of the boxes contain pans, half of the remaining boxes contain decorations, and the rest of the boxes contain her teacups. Samuel breaks 2 of the cups every time he picks up one of the boxes. By the time Samuel has taken all of the teacups out of the boxes, how many teacups are left?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many teacups are left after Samuel has taken all of them out of the boxes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of boxes that contain teacups.\n2. Determine the total number of teacups initially.\n3. Calculate the number of teacups Samuel breaks.\n4. Subtract the number of broken teacups from the initial total.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of boxes that contain teacups.**\n\nThere are 26 boxes in total. Out of these, 6 boxes contain pans. Therefore, the number of boxes left is:\n\\[ 26 - 6 = 20 \\]\n\nHalf of the remaining boxes contain decorations, so the number of boxes that contain decorations is:\n\\[ \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\]\n\nThe rest of the boxes contain teacups, so the number of boxes that contain teacups is:\n\\[ 20 - 10 = 10 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of teacups initially.**\n\nEach box contains teacups stacked 5 rows high with 4 cups in each row. Therefore, the number of teacups in each box is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\]\n\nSince there are 10 boxes that contain teacups, the total number of teacups initially is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 20 = 200 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of teacups Samuel breaks.**\n\nSamuel breaks 2 cups every time he picks up one of the boxes. Since there are 10 boxes that contain teacups, the total number of teacups he breaks is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the number of broken teacups from the initial total.**\n\nThe number of teacups left after Samuel has taken all of them out of the boxes is:\n\\[ 200 - 20 = 180 \\]\n\nThus, the number of teacups left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]",
