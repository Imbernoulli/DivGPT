It takes him thirty minutes to bike to work. The bus takes ten minutes longer since it stops at every bus stop for other passengers. His friend driving him is the fastest and cuts two-thirds off his biking time. How many minutes does he spend every week commuting to work?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
