        "To determine the total number of wheels on the floor when all 40 people skated at one time, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of wheels on each person's roller skates.\n2. Multiply the number of wheels per person by the total number of people.\n\nFirst, we know that each person wears a pair of roller skates. Since each pair consists of two skates, and each skate has 4 wheels, each person has:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ skates} \\times 4 \\text{ wheels per skate} = 8 \\text{ wheels} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many wheels there are for 40 people. We do this by multiplying the number of wheels per person by the total number of people:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ wheels per person} \\times 40 \\text{ people} = 320 \\text{ wheels} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of wheels on the floor when all 40 people skated at one time is:\n\\[ \\boxed{320} \\]",
