        "To determine the total number of cents that Lance, Margaret, Guy, and Bill have combined, we will convert each person's amount into cents and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Lance's amount:**\n   Lance has 70 cents.\n\n2. **Margaret's amount:**\n   Margaret has three-fourths of a dollar. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, three-fourths of a dollar is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\times 100 = 75 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Guy's amount:**\n   Guy has two quarters and a dime. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, and a dime is worth 10 cents. Therefore, the total amount Guy has is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 25 + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Bill's amount:**\n   Bill has six dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents. Therefore, the total amount Bill has is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 10 = 60 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the amounts from each person:\n\\[\n70 + 75 + 60 + 60 = 265 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of cents they have combined is \\boxed{265}.",
