        "To determine how much Carrie pays for the clothes, we first need to calculate the total cost of all the items she buys. We can do this by finding the cost of each type of clothing and then summing these costs.\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the shirts:\n   Carrie buys 4 shirts, and each shirt costs $8.\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ shirts} \\times \\$8 \\text{ per shirt} = \\$32\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the pants:\n   Carrie buys 2 pairs of pants, and each pair costs $18.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ pairs of pants} \\times \\$18 \\text{ per pair} = \\$36\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the cost of the jackets:\n   Carrie buys 2 jackets, and each jacket costs $60.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ jackets} \\times \\$60 \\text{ per jacket} = \\$120\n   \\]\n\n4. Add the costs of the shirts, pants, and jackets to find the total cost of all the clothes:\n   \\[\n   \\$32 + \\$36 + \\$120 = \\$188\n   \\]\n\n5. Since Carrie's mom pays for half of the total cost, Carrie pays the other half. We calculate half of \\$188:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$188}{2} = \\$94\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Carrie pays \\(\\boxed{94}\\) dollars for the clothes.",

Calculate the cost of the shirts:\n   Carrie buys 4 shirts, and each shirt costs $8.\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 8 = 32\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the shirts is $32.\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the pants:\n   Carrie buys 2 pairs of pants, and each pair of pants costs $18.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 18 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the pants is $36.\n\n3. Calculate the cost of the jackets:\n   Carrie buys 2 jackets, and each jacket costs $60.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 60 = 120\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the jackets is $120.\n\n4. Add up the costs of all the items to find the total cost:\n   \\[\n   32 + 36 + 120 = 188\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of all the clothes is $188.\n\n5. Since Carrie's mom pays for half of the total cost, Carrie pays the other half. Therefore, we need to divide the total cost by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{188}{2} = 94\n   \\]\n   So, Carrie pays $94 for the clothes.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{94}\\).",

Determine how much Carrie's mom pays by calculating half of the total cost.\n6. Subtract the amount paid by Carrie's mom from the total cost to find out how much Carrie pays.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. The total cost of the shirts:\n   Carrie buys 4 shirts, and each shirt costs $8.\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 8 = 32\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the shirts is $32.\n\n2.

The total cost of the jackets:\n   Carrie buys 2 jackets, and each jacket costs $60.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 60 = 120\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the jackets is $120.\n\n4. The total cost of all the clothes:\n   Add the total costs of the shirts, pants, and jackets.\n   \\[\n   32 + 36 + 120 = 188\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of all the clothes is $188.\n\n5.
