        "To determine how many ounces of soda Peter bought, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how much money Peter spent.\n2. Determine how many ounces of soda he can buy with the amount of money he spent.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much money Peter spent. He started with $2 and left with $0.50. Therefore, the amount of money he spent is:\n\\[ 2 - 0.50 = 1.50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the amount of money he spent into ounces of soda. Since the soda costs $0.25 per ounce, we can find out how many ounces he bought by dividing the amount of money he spent by the cost per ounce:\n\\[ 1.50 \\div 0.25 = 6 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nSo, Peter bought \\(\\boxed{6}\\) ounces of soda.",
