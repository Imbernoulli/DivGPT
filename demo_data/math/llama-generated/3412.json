A 50% discount means that Jorge pays only half of the original total cost. So, we calculate half of $168:\n\n\\[ 168 \\times 0.50 = 84 \\]\n\nThus, the amount Jorge spent on the tickets is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{84} \\]",
        "To determine how much Jorge spent on tickets after the discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets before the discount.\n2. Apply the discount to the total cost.\n3. Find the final amount Jorge spent.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the tickets before the discount. Jorge bought 24 tickets, and each ticket costs $7. So, we multiply the number of tickets by the cost per ticket:\n\\[\n24 \\times 7 = 168\n\\]\nThis means the total cost of the tickets before the discount is $168.\n\nNext, we apply the discount. The discount is 50%, so we need to find out what 50% of $168 is. We do this by multiplying $168 by 0.50:\n\\[\n168 \\times 0.50 = 84\n\\]\nThis means the discount amount is $84. To find the final amount Jorge spent, we subtract the discount from the original total cost:\n\\[\n168 - 84 = 84\n\\]\nTherefore, the final amount Jorge spent on tickets is \\(\\boxed{84}\\).",
