Since Ahmed has four times as many apple trees as Hassan, we multiply the number of apple trees Hassan has by 4:\n\\[ 1 \\times 4 = 4 \\]\nSo, Ahmed has 4 apple trees.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of trees in Ahmed's orchard.**\n\nAhmed has 8 orange trees and 4 apple trees. Adding these together gives:\n\\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \\]\nSo, Ahmed has 12 trees in total.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees in Hassan's orchard.**\n\nHassan has 1 apple tree and 2 orange trees. Adding these together gives:\n\\[ 1 + 2 = 3 \\]\nSo, Hassan has 3 trees in total.\n\n**Step 4: Find the difference between the total number of trees in Ahmed's orchard and the total number of trees in Hassan's orchard.**\n\nSubtract the total number of trees in Hassan's orchard from the total number of trees in Ahmed's orchard:\n\\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are \\(\\boxed{9}\\) more trees in Ahmed's orchard than in Hassan's.",

Ahmed has 8 orange trees and four times as many apple trees as Hassan. Since Hassan has 1 apple tree, Ahmed has:\n\\[ 4 \\times 1 = 4 \\]\napple trees. Therefore, the total number of trees in Ahmed's orchard is:\n\\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \\]\n\nNow, we find the difference between the total number of trees in Ahmed's orchard and the total number of trees in Hassan's orchard:\n\\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \\]\n\nThus, there are \\(\\boxed{9}\\) more trees in Ahmed's orchard than in Hassan's.",

        "To determine how many more trees are in Ahmed's orchard than in Hassan's, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of apple trees in Ahmed's orchard.\n2. Calculate the total number of trees in Ahmed's orchard.\n3. Calculate the total number of trees in Hassan's orchard.\n4. Find the difference between the total number of trees in Ahmed's orchard and the total number of trees in Hassan's orchard.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of apple trees in Ahmed's orchard. Hassan has one apple tree, and Ahmed has four times as many apple trees as Hassan:\n\\[\n4 \\times 1 = 4\n\\]\nSo, Ahmed has 4 apple trees.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of trees in Ahmed's orchard. Ahmed has 8 orange trees and 4 apple trees:\n\\[\n8 + 4 = 12\n\\]\nSo, Ahmed has 12 trees in total.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of trees in Hassan's orchard. Hassan has 2 orange trees and 1 apple tree:\n\\[\n2 + 1 = 3\n\\]\nSo, Hassan has 3 trees in total.\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the total number of trees in Ahmed's orchard and the total number of trees in Hassan's orchard:\n\\[\n12 - 3 = 9\n\\]\nSo, Ahmed has 9 more trees than Hassan.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]",
