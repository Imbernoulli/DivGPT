        "To determine the age difference between Lexie's brother and her sister, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Lexie's age.\n2. Use Lexie's age to find her brother's age.\n3. Use Lexie's age to find her sister's age.\n4. Calculate the age difference between her brother and her sister.\n\nGiven:\n- Lexie is 8 years old.\n- Lexie is 6 years older than her brother.\n- Her sister is twice her age.\n\nFirst, let's find Lexie's brother's age. Since Lexie is 6 years older than her brother, we can express her brother's age as:\n\\[ \\text{Brother's age} = \\text{Lexie's age} - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2 \\]\n\nNext, let's find Lexie's sister's age. Since her sister is twice her age, we can express her sister's age as:\n\\[ \\text{Sister's age} = 2 \\times \\text{Lexie's age} = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the age difference between her brother and her sister:\n\\[ \\text{Age difference} = \\text{Sister's age} - \\text{Brother's age} = 16 - 2 = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, the age difference between Lexie's brother and her sister is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]",

Since her sister is twice Lexie's age, we can express her sister's age as:\n\\[ \\text{Sister's age} = 2 \\times \\text{Lexie's age} = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the age difference between her brother and her sister:\n\\[ \\text{Age difference} = \\text{Sister's age} - \\text{Brother's age} = 16 - 2 = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, the age difference between her brother and her sister is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]",
        "To determine the age difference between Lexie's brother and her sister, we start by identifying the ages of each family member based on the information given.\n\n1. Lexie's age is given as 8 years.\n2. Lexie is 6 years older than her brother. Therefore, her brother's age is:\n   \\[\n   8 - 6 = 2 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n3. Lexie's sister is twice her age. Therefore, her sister's age is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 8 = 16 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n4. The age difference between her brother and her sister is:\n   \\[\n   16 - 2 = 14 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the age difference between Lexie's brother and her sister is \\(\\boxed{14}\\)."
