Since she has 8 red pens, we calculate the number of black pens as follows:\n   \\[\n   8 + 10 = 18\n   \\]\n   So, Maria has 18 black pens.\n\n3. **Blue Pens:**\n   Maria has 7 more blue pens than red pens. Since she has 8 red pens, we calculate the number of blue pens as follows:\n   \\[\n   8 + 7 = 15\n   \\]\n   So, Maria has 15 blue pens.\n\n4. **Total Pens:**\n   To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens, black pens, and blue pens together:\n   \\[\n   8 + 18 + 15\n   \\]\n\n   First, add the red pens and black pens:\n   \\[\n   8 + 18 = 26\n   \\]\n\n   Next, add the blue pens:\n   \\[\n   26 + 15 = 41\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pens in Maria's desk drawer is \\boxed{41}.",

        "To determine the total number of pens in Maria's desk drawer, we need to calculate the number of each type of pen and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 8 red pens. This is given directly in the problem.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of black pens. The problem states that there are 10 more black pens than red pens. Therefore, we can calculate the number of black pens as follows:\n\\[\n8 + 10 = 18\n\\]\nSo, there are 18 black pens.\n\nThen, we need to find the number of blue pens.
