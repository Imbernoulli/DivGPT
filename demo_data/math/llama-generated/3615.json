        "To determine how many miniature racing cars Tom has left after giving some to his nephews, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of miniature racing cars Tom initially bought.\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ packages} \\times 5 \\text{ cars per package} = 50 \\text{ cars}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine how many cars Tom gave to each nephew. Since each nephew received \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the total cars:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times 50 = 10 \\text{ cars per nephew}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the total number of cars Tom gave to both nephews:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ cars per nephew} \\times 2 \\text{ nephews} = 20 \\text{ cars}\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract the number of cars given to the nephews from the total number of cars Tom initially had:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ cars} - 20 \\text{ cars} = 30 \\text{ cars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of miniature racing cars left with Tom is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
        "First, we need to determine the total number of miniature racing cars Tom bought.

Therefore, we calculate the number of cars each nephew received:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{5} \\times 50 \\text{ cars} = 10 \\text{ cars per nephew} \\]\n\nSince Tom has two nephews, we multiply the number of cars each nephew received by 2:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ cars per nephew} \\times 2 \\text{ nephews} = 20 \\text{ cars} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of cars given to the nephews from the original total number of cars to find out how many cars Tom has left:\n\n\\[ 50 \\text{ cars} - 20 \\text{ cars} = 30 \\text{ cars} \\]\n\nThus, the number of miniature racing cars left with Tom is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

Determine how many cars each nephew received.\n3. Calculate the total number of cars given to the nephews.\n4. Subtract the total number of cars given to the nephews from the initial total.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Tom bought 10 packages of miniature racing cars, and each package contains 5 cars. Therefore, the total number of cars is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 5 = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. Tom gave each of his two nephews \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the cars. First, we need to find out how many cars \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the total is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times 50 = 10\n   \\]\n   Since Tom has two nephews, the total number of cars given to both nephews is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 2 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. To find out how many cars Tom has left, we subtract the total number of cars given to the nephews from the initial total:\n   \\[\n   50 - 20 = 30\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of miniature racing cars left with Tom is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

We do this by multiplying the number of cars each nephew received by 2:\n\n\\[\n10 \\text{ cars per nephew} \\times 2 \\text{ nephews} = 20 \\text{ cars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we need to determine how many cars are left with Tom after giving some to his nephews. We subtract the total number of cars given to the nephews from the total number of cars Tom originally had:\n\n\\[\n50 \\text{ cars} - 20 \\text{ cars} = 30 \\text{ cars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of miniature racing cars left with Tom is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
        "To determine how many miniature racing cars Tom has left after giving some to his nephews, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cars Tom bought:**\n   Tom bought 10 packages, and each package contains 5 cars.\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ packages} \\times 5 \\text{ cars per package} = 50 \\text{ cars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many cars each nephew receives:**\n   Tom gave each of his two nephews \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the total cars.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times 50 \\text{ cars} = 10 \\text{ cars per nephew}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of cars given to both nephews:**\n   Tom has two nephews, so he gave away:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ cars per nephew} \\times 2 \\text{ nephews} = 20 \\text{ cars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many cars Tom has left:**\n   Subtract the number of cars given to the nephews from the total number of cars Tom initially had:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ cars} - 20 \\text{ cars} = 30 \\text{ cars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of miniature racing cars left with Tom is \\(\\boxed{30}\\)."
