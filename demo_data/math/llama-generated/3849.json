        "To determine the total weight of all the litter collected, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bags collected by Gina and the neighborhood.\n2. Determine the weight of all the bags.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many bags the neighborhood collected. Gina collected 2 bags by herself, and the neighborhood collected 82 times as many bags as Gina. So, we calculate:\n\\[ 82 \\times 2 = 164 \\]\nThis means the neighborhood collected 164 bags. Adding the bags Gina collected, the total number of bags collected is:\n\\[ 2 + 164 = 166 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total weight of all the bags. Since each bag weighs 4 pounds, we multiply the total number of bags by the weight of each bag:\n\\[ 166 \\times 4 = 664 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight of all the litter collected is:\n\\[ \\boxed{664} \\]",
