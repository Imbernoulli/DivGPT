        "To determine how many points Max, Dulce, and Val's team is behind their opponents, we need to calculate the total points for their team and then find the difference between their team's points and their opponents' points.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the points for each team member:\n\n1. Max has 5 points.\n2. Dulce has 3 points.\n3. Val has twice the combined points of Max and Dulce. The combined points of Max and Dulce is \\(5 + 3 = 8\\). Therefore, Val has \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) points.\n\nNext, we sum the points of Max, Dulce, and Val to find the total points for their team:\n\\[5 + 3 + 16 = 24\\]\n\nThe opponents' team has 40 points. To find out how many points Max, Dulce, and Val's team is behind, we subtract their team's points from their opponents' points:\n\\[40 - 24 = 16\\]\n\nThus, Max, Dulce, and Val's team is behind by \\(\\boxed{16}\\) points.",
