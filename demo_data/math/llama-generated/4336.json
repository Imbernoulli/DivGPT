        "To determine Victoria's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and then subtract that from her initial amount of money. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the rice:\n   Victoria bought 2 packets of rice, each costing $20.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 20 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the rice is $40.\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the wheat flour:\n   Victoria bought 3 packets of wheat flour, each costing $25.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 25 = 75\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the wheat flour is $75.\n\n3. Calculate the cost of the soda:\n   Victoria bought 1 soda costing $150.\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 150 = 150\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the soda is $150.\n\n4. Calculate the total cost of all the items:\n   Add the cost of the rice, the cost of the wheat flour, and the cost of the soda.\n   \\[\n   40 + 75 + 150 = 265\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of all the items is $265.\n\n5. Calculate Victoria's remaining balance:\n   Subtract the total cost of the items from her initial amount of money.\n   \\[\n   500 - 265 = 235\n   \\]\n   So, Victoria's remaining balance is \\boxed{235}.",
