        "To determine the total number of letters Sara sent, we need to calculate the number of letters sent in each month and then sum them up.\n\n1. **January:**\n   Sara sent 6 letters.\n\n2. **February:**\n   Sara sent 9 letters.\n\n3. **March:**\n   Sara sent triple the number of letters she sent in January. Since she sent 6 letters in January, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 6 = 18\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Sara sent 18 letters in March.\n\n4. **Total letters:**\n   To find the total number of letters sent over the three months, we add the letters sent in January, February, and March:\n   \\[\n   6 + 9 + 18 = 33\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of letters Sara sent is \\boxed{33}.",
