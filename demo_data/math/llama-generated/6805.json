        "To determine the percentage chance that Janet will pick a pepperjack cheese stick, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cheese sticks.\n2. Determine the fraction of cheese sticks that are pepperjack.\n3. Convert the fraction to a percentage.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of cheese sticks. Janet has 15 cheddar, 30 mozzarella, and 45 pepperjack cheese sticks. Adding these together gives:\n\n\\[ 15 + 30 + 45 = 90 \\]\n\nSo, there are 90 cheese sticks in total.\n\nNext, we need to find the fraction of cheese sticks that are pepperjack. Since there are 45 pepperjack cheese sticks out of 90 total cheese sticks, the fraction is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{45}{90} \\]\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 45:\n\n\\[ \\frac{45 \\div 45}{90 \\div 45} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nNow, we convert the fraction \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to a percentage. To do this, we multiply the fraction by 100:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 = 50\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage chance that Janet will pick a pepperjack cheese stick is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",
