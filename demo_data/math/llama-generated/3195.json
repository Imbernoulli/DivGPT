        "To determine the loss the hotel incurred, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total payments received from clients.\n2. Subtract the total payments received from the total operations expenses.\n\nFirst, we know that the total operations expenses are $100. The hotel received clients whose total payments for services offeredSTRUCT contributive 3/4 of the cost of the operations. Therefore, we calculate the total payments received as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total payments received} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 100 = 75\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total payments received from the total operations expenses to find the loss:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Loss} = \\text{Total operations expenses} - \\text{Total payments received} = 100 - 75 = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, the loss the hotel incurred is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
