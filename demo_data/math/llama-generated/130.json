        "To determine how much Mimi spent on clothes, we need to break down the total expenditure of $8,000 into the amounts spent on each type of item: Nike sneakers, Adidas sneakers, Skechers, and clothes.\n\nFirst, we know that Mimi spent $600 on Adidas sneakers. Let's denote the amount spent on Adidas sneakers as \\(A\\). Therefore, \\(A = 600\\).\n\nNext, we know that she spent thrice as much on Nike sneakers as she did on Adidas sneakers. Let's denote the amount spent on Nike sneakers as \\(N\\). Therefore, \\(N = 3A = 3 \\times 600 = 1800\\).\n\nWe also know that the amount spent on Adidas sneakers was \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) the cost of Skechers. Let's denote the amount spent on Skechers as \\(S\\). Therefore, \\(A = \\frac{1}{5}S\\), which implies \\(S = 5A = 5 \\times 600 = 3000\\).\n\nNow, we can find the total amount spent onartial sneakers, Adidas sneakers, and Skechers:\n\\[N + A + S = 1800 + 600 + 3000 = 5400.\\]\n\nSince the total expenditure is $8,000, the amount spent on clothes is:\n\\[8000 - 5400 = 2600.\\]\n\nThus, the amount Mimi spent on clothes is \\(\\boxed{2600}\\).",
        "Let's denote the amount Mimi spent on Adidas sneakers as \\( A \\), the amount spent on Nike sneakers as \\( N \\), the amount spent on Skechers as \\( S \\), and the amount spent on clothes as \\( C \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. \\( A = 600 \\)\n2. \\( N = 3A \\)\n3. \\( A = \\frac{1}{5}S \\)\n4. The total amount spent on athletic sneakers and clothes is $8,000, so \\( A + N + S + C = 8000 \\).\n\nFirst, we substitute \\( A = 600 \\) into the equations for \\( N \\) and \\( S \\):\n\\[ N = 3 \\times 600 = 1800 \\]\n\\[ S = 5 \\times 600 = 3000 \\]\n\nNow we substitute \\( A = 600 \\), \\( N = 1800 \\), and \\( S = 3000 \\) into the total expenditure equation:\n\\[ 600 + 1800 + 3000 + C = 8000 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 5400 + C = 8000 \\]\n\nTo find \\( C \\), we subtract 5400 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ C = 8000 - 5400 = 2600 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Mimi spent on clothes is \\(\\boxed{2600}\\).",

Let's denote the amount spent on Nike sneakers as \\( N \\) and the amount spent on Skechers as \\( S \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know that Mimi spent thrice as much on Nike sneakers as she did on Adidas. Therefore, we can express \\( N \\) as:\n\\[ N = 3 \\times 600 = 1800 \\]\n\nWe also know that the amount spent on Adidas sneakers was \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) the cost of Skechers. Therefore, we can express \\( S \\) as:\n\\[ S = 5 \\times 600 = 3000 \\]\n\nNow, we know the total amount spent on athletic sneakers and clothes is $8000. The total amount spent on athletic sneakers is the sum of the amounts spent on Nike sneakers, Adidas sneakers, and Skechers:\n\\[ N + A + S = 1800 + 600 + 3000 = 5400 \\]\n\nThe amount spent on clothes is the total amount spent minus the amount spent on athletic sneakers:\n\\[ \\text{Amount spent on clothes} = 8000 - 5400 = 2600 \\]\n\nThus, the amount Mimi spent on clothes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2600} \\]",
        "To determine how much Mimi spent on clothes, we need to break down her total expenditure into the costs of each item she purchased. Let's start with the information given:\n\n1. Mimi spent $600 on Adidas sneakers.\n2. She spent three times as much on Nike sneakers as she did on Adidas sneakers.\n3. The amount spent on Adidas sneakers was \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) the cost of Skechers.\n4. The total expenditure on athletic sneakers and clothes was $8,000.\n\nFirst, calculate the amount spent on Nike sneakers:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount spent on Nike sneakers} = 3 \\times \\text{Amount spent on Adidas sneakers} = 3 \\times 600 = 1800\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the amount spent on Skechers:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount spent on Skechers} = 5 \\times \\text{Amount spent on Adidas sneakers} = 5 \\times 600 = 3000\n\\]\n\nNow, add up the amounts spent on Adidas sneakers, Nike sneakers, and Skechers:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount spent on sneakers} = \\text{Amount spent on Adidas sneakers} + \\text{Amount spent on Nike sneakers} + \\text{Amount spent on Skechers} = 600 + 1800 + 3000 = 5400\n\\]\n\nFinally, subtract the total amount spent on sneakers from the total expenditure to find the amount spent on clothes:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount spent on clothes} = \\text{Total expenditure} - \\text{Total amount spent on sneakers} = 8000 - 5400 = 2600\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount Mimi spent on clothes is \\(\\boxed{2600}\\)."
