Since Stan caught 13 pieces:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Carlos's candy} = 2 \\times 13 = 26 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we sum the pieces of candy caught by each friend:\n\\[\n\\text{Total candy} = \\text{Tabitha's candy} + \\text{Stan's candy} + \\text{Julie's candy} + \\text{Carlos's candy}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total candy} = 22 + 13 + 11 + 26\n\\]\n\nWe perform the addition step-by-step:\n\\[\n22 + 13 = 35\n\\]\n\\[\n35 + 11 = 46\n\\]\n\\[\n46 + 26 = 72\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pieces of candy caught by Tabitha and her friends is \\boxed{72}.",
