        "To determine the total time the plane took to hover over Mountain time, Central time, and Eastern time in the two days, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time spent hovering in each time zone on the first day:\n- Mountain time: 3 hours\n- Central time: 4 hours\n- Eastern time: 2 hours\n\nNext, we calculate the time spent hovering in each time zone on the second day.

According to the problem, the plane took 2 more hours to hover in each place it passed through the previous day:\n- Mountain time: \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) hours\n- Central time: \\(4 + 2 = 6\\) hours\n- Eastern time: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\) hours\n\nNow, we sum the times for each time zone over the two days:\n- Total time in Mountain time: \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) hours\n- Total time in Central time: \\(4 + 6 = 10\\) hours\n- Total time in Eastern time: \\(2 + 4 = 6\\) hours\n\nFinally, we sum the total times for all three time zones:\n\\[8 + 10 + 6 = 24\\]\n\nThus, the total time the plane took to hover over Mountain time, Central time, and Eastern time in the two days is \\(\\boxed{24}\\) hours.",
        "To determine the total time the airplane焚 the plane to hover over Mountain time, Central time, and Eastern time over the two days, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time spent hovering in each time zone on the first day:\n- Mountain time: 3 hours\n- Central time: 4 hours\n- Eastern time: 2 hours\n\nNext, we calculate the time spent hovering in each time zone on the second day. The problem states that the plane took 2 more hours to hover in each place it passed through the previous day:\n- Mountain time: \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) hours\n- Central time: \\(4 + 2 = 6\\) hours\n- Eastern time: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\) hours\n\nNow, we sum up the time spent hovering in each time zone over the two days:\n- Total time in Mountain time: \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) hours\n- Total time in Central time: \\(4 + 6 = 10\\) hours\n- Total time in Eastern time: \\(2 + 4 = 6\\) hours\n\nFinally, we sum up the total time spent hovering in all three time zones over the two days:\n\\[8 + 10 + 6 = 24\\]\n\nThus, the total time the plane took to hover over Mountain time, Central time, and Eastern time in the two days is \\(\\boxed{24}\\) hours."
