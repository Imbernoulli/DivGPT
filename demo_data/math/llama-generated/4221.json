        "To determine how many hours of classes Kim has now per day, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours Kim initially spent on classes per day.\n2.

She takes 4 classes, and each class lasts 2 hours:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ classes} \\times 2 \\text{ hours per class} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many hours she spends on classes after dropping one class. Since she drops one class, she now has:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ classes} - 1 \\text{ class} = 3 \\text{ classes} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of hours she spends on the remaining classes:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ classes} \\times 2 \\text{ hours per class} = 6 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hours of classes Kim has now per day is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
