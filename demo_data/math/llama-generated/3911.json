        "To determine the total number of plants in Betty's herb garden, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of basil plants.\n2. Calculate the number of oregano plants based on the given relationship.\n3. Add the number of basil plants and oregano plants to find the total number of plants in the garden.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 5 basil plants. Let's denote the number of basil plants as \\( B \\). So, \\( B = 5 \\).\n\nNext, we are told that there are 2 more than twice as many oregano plants as basil. Let's denote the number of oregano plants as \\( O \\). According to the problem, the number of oregano plants can be calculated as:\n\\[ O = 2 \\times B + 2 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( B \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ O = 2 \\times 5 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of plants in the garden. The total number of plants is the sum of the number of basil plants and the number of oregano plants:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of plants} = B + O = 5 + 12 = 17 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of plants in the garden is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",
