Since there are 12 students, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of students:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{108}{12} = 9\n   \\]\n   So, each student would get 9 oranges if no oranges were bad.\n\n3. **Determine how many oranges each student will get after throwing away the bad ones:**\n   With 72 good oranges and 12 students, we divide the number of good oranges by the number of students:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{72}{12} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, each student will get 6 oranges after throwing away the bad ones.\n\n4. **Calculate how many fewer oranges each student will get now than if no orange had to be thrown away:**\n   We subtract the number of oranges each student gets after throwing away the bad ones from the number of oranges each student would get if no oranges were bad:\n   \\[\n   9 - 6 = 3\n   \\]\n   So, each student will get 3 fewer oranges now than if no orange had to be thrown away.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
