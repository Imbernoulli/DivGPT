        "To determine how many bottles of water were used during the second game, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bottles of water initially bought.\n2. Subtract the number of bottles used during the first game from the initial total.\n3.

The school bought 10 cases, and each case contains 20 bottles:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ cases} \\times 20 \\text{ bottles per case} = 200 \\text{ bottles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many bottles of water were left after the first game. Since 70 bottles were used during the first game, we subtract 70 from the initial total:\n\\[\n200 \\text{ bottles} - 70 \\text{ bottles} = 130 \\text{ bottles}\n\\]\n\nAfter the second game, only 20 bottles of water were left. To find out how many bottles were used during the second game, we subtract the number of bottles left after the second game from the number of bottles left after the first game:\n\\[\n130 \\text{ bottles} - 20 \\text{ bottles} = 110 \\text{ bottles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bottles of water used during the second game is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",
