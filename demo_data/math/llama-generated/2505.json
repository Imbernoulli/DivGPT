Multiply the population by the number of cell phones per thousand people:\n   \\[\n   974,000 \\text{ people} \\times 673 \\text{ cell phones per 1000 people}\n   \\]\n\n2. Perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   974,000 \\times 673 = 655,502,000\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide the result by 1000 to convert from cell phones per thousand people to total cell phones:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{655,502,000}{1000} = 655,502\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cell phones in Delaware is \\(\\boxed{655502}\\).",
