        "To determine how much money Kenneth has left after his purchases, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the baguettes.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the bottles of water.\n3. Add the total costs of the baguettes and the bottles of water to find the total amount spent.\n4. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Kenneth had.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n1. The cost of one baguette is $2, and Kenneth bought 2 baguettes.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ baguettes} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per baguette} = \\$4\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the baguettes is $4.\n\n2. The cost of one bottle of water is $1, and Kenneth bought 2 bottles of water.\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ bottles of water} \\times \\$1 \\text{ per bottle} = \\$2\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the bottles of water is $2.\n\n3. Add the total cost of the baguettes and the total cost of the bottles of water to find the total amount spent.\n   \\[\n   \\$4 + \\$2 = \\$6\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount spent is $6.\n\n4. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Kenneth had.\n   \\[\n   \\$50 - \\$6 = \\$44\n   \\]\n   So, the amount of money Kenneth has left is $\\boxed{44}$.",

Calculate the total cost of the bottles of water.\n3. Add the costs of the baguettes and the bottles of water to find the total amount spent.\n4. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Kenneth had.\n\nLet's start with the cost of the baguettes. Kenneth bought 2 baguettes, and each baguette costs $2. Therefore, the total cost of the baguettes is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ baguettes} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per baguette} = \\$4 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the bottles of water. Kenneth bought 2 bottles of water, and each bottle of water costs $1. Therefore, the total cost of the bottles of water is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ bottles of water} \\times \\$1 \\text{ per bottle} = \\$2 \\]\n\nNow, we add the costs of the baguettes and the bottles of water to find the total amount spent:\n\\[ \\$4 + \\$2 = \\$6 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Kenneth had:\n\\[ \\$50 - \\$6 = \\$44 \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money Kenneth has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{44} \\]",
