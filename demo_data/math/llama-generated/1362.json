        "To determine how many erasers Celine collected, we start by defining the number of erasers Gabriel collected as \\( g \\). According to the problem, Celine collected twice as many erasers as Gabriel, so Celine collected \\( 2g \\) erasers. Julian collected twice as many erasers as Celine, so Julian collected \\( 2 \\times 2g = 4g \\) erasers.\n\nThe total number of erasers collected by Gabriel, Celine, and Julian is given as 35. Therefore, we can write the following equation to represent the total number of erasers:\n\n\\[ g + 2g + 4g = 35 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ 7g = 35 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( g \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:\n\n\\[ g = 5 \\]\n\nNow that we know Gabriel collected 5 erasers, we can find out how many erasers Celine collected by calculating \\( 2g \\):\n\n\\[ 2g = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of erasers Celine collected is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
