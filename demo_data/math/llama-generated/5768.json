        "To determine how much Mike paid for the camera and lens, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the new camera.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the camera and the lens after the discount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the new camera. The new model costs 30% more than the current model. The current model costs $4000. Therefore, the cost of the new camera is:\n\\[ 4000 + 0.30 \\times 4000 = 4000 + 1200 = 5200 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of the camera and the lens after the discount. The lens originally costs $400, but Mike gets $200 off. Therefore, the cost of the lens after the discount is:\n\\[ 400 - 200 = 200 \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the new camera and the cost of the lens after the discount to find the total amount Mike paid:\n\\[ 5200 + 200 = 5400 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount Mike paid for the camera and lens is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5400} \\]",
        "To determine how much Mike paid for the camera and lens, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the new camera.\n2. Subtract the discount from the cost of the lens.\n3. Add the cost of the new camera to the discounted cost of the lens.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the new camera.**\n\nThe new camera costs 30% more than the current model. The current model costs $4000. First, we calculate 30% of $4000:\n\\[ 0.30 \\times 4000 = 1200 \\]\n\nNext, we add this amount to the cost of the current model to find the cost of the new camera:\n\\[ 4000 + 1200 = 5200 \\]\n\nSo, the new camera costs $5200.\n\n**Step 2: Subtract the discount from the cost of the lens.**\n\nThe lens originally costs $400, but Mike gets $200 off. So, we subtract $200 from $400:\n\\[ 400 - 200 = 200 \\]\n\nSo, the discounted cost of the lens is $200.\n\n**Step 3: Add the cost of the new camera to the discounted cost of the lens.**\n\nNow, we add the cost of the new camera ($5200) to the discounted cost of the lens ($200):\n\\[ 5200 + 200 = 5400 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Mike paid for the camera and lens is \\(\\boxed{5400}\\).",

Add the cost of the new camera and the discounted lens.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the new camera.**\n\nThe new camera costs 30% more than the current model. The current model costs $4000. First, we find 30% of $4000:\n\n\\[ 30\\% \\text{ of } 4000 = 0.30 \\times 4000 = 1200 \\]\n\nNext, we add this amount to the cost of the current model to get the cost of the new camera:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of the new camera} = 4000 + 1200 = 5200 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost of the lens after the discount.**\n\nThe lens originally costs $400, and Mike gets $200 off. So, we subtract the discount from the original price:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of the lens after discount} = 400 - 200 = 200 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the cost of the new camera and the discounted lens.**\n\nFinally, we add the cost of the new camera and the cost of the lens after the discount to find the total amount Mike paid:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total amount paid} = 5200 + 200 = 5400 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Mike paid for the camera and the lens is \\(\\boxed{5400}\\).",
