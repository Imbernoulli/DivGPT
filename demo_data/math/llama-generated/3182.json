        "To determine how many bottles of shampoo Brittany needs to get through a leap year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of days in a leap year:**\n   A leap year has 366 days.\n\n2. **Determine how many days Brittany washes her hair:**\n   Brittany washes her hair every other day. Therefore, she washes her hair:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{366}{2} = 183 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of shampoo used in a leap year:**\n   Brittany uses \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) ounce of shampoo each time she washes her hair.

Therefore, the number of times she washes her hair in a leap year is:\n\\[\n\\frac{366}{2} = 183\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of shampoo used in a leap year.**\nBrittany uses \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) ounce of shampoo each time she washes her hair. Therefore, the total amount of shampoo used in a leap year is:\n\\[\n183 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{183}{4} = 45.75 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine how many bottles of shampoo are needed.**\nBrittany buys shampoo in 14-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of shampoo used by the amount of shampoo per bottle:\n\\[\n\\frac{45.75}{14} \\approx 3.2679\n\\]\nSince Brittany cannot buy a fraction of a bottle, she needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she needs 4 bottles.\n\nThe number of bottles Brittany needs to get through a leap year is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
