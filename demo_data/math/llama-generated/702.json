The age difference between the elder son and the younger son is 10 years.\n3. Therefore, the current age of the younger son is:\n   \\[\n   40 - 10 = 30 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n4. To find out how old the younger son will be 30 years from now, we add 30 years to his current age:\n   \\[\n   30 + 30 = 60 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the younger son will be \\boxed{60} years old 30 years from now.",
        "To determine how old Declan's younger son will be 30 years from now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the current age of the younger son:**\n   - We know the elder son is currently 40 years old.\n   - The difference in age between the elder son and the younger son is 10 years.\n   - Therefore, the younger son is:\n     \\[\n     40 - 10 = 30 \\text{ years old}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the age of the younger son 30 years from now:**\n   - The younger son is currently 30 years old.\n   - In 30 years, he will be:\n     \\[\n     30 + 30 = 60 \\text{ years old}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the younger son will be \\(\\boxed{60}\\) years old 30 years from now.",
