Calculate the total earnings from haircuts:\n   Rebecca has four haircuts scheduled, and each haircut costs $30.\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 30 = 120\n   \\]\n   So, she earns $120 from haircuts.\n\n2. Calculate the total earnings from perms:\n   Rebecca has one perm scheduled, and each perm costs $40.\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 40 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, she earns $40 from perms.\n\n3. Calculate the total earnings from dye jobs:\n   Rebecca has two dye jobs scheduled, and each dye job costs $60. However, she has to buy a box of hair dye for each dye job, and each box costs $10.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times (60 - 10) = 2 \\times 50 = 100\n   \\]\n   So, she earns $100 from dye jobs after subtracting the cost of the hair dye.\n\n4.

Add the tips:\n   Rebecca makes $50 in tips.\n   \\[\n   260 + 50 = 310\n   \\]\n   So, her total earnings at the end of the day is $310.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Rebecca will have at the end of the day is \\(\\boxed{310}\\).",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the total earnings from haircuts:\n   Rebecca has four haircuts scheduled, and each haircut costs $30.\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 30 = 120\n   \\]\n   So, she earns $120 from haircuts.\n\n2. Calculate the total earnings from perms:\n   Rebecca has one perm scheduled, and each perm costs $40.\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 40 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, she earns $40 from perms.\n\n3. Calculate the total earnings from dye jobs:\n   Rebecca has two dye jobs scheduled, and each dye job costs $60. However, she has to buy a box of hair dye for each dye job, and each box costs $10.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times (60 - 10) = 2 \\times 50 = 100\n   \\]\n   So, she earns $100 from dye jobs after subtracting the cost of the hair dye.\n\n4. Calculate the total earnings from all services:\n   Add the earnings from haircuts, perms, and dye jobs.\n   \\[\n   120 + 40 + 100 = 260\n   \\]\n   So, her total earnings from services are $260.\n\n5. Add the tips:\n   Rebecca makes $50 in tips.\n   \\[\n   260 + 50 = 310\n   \\]\n   So, her total earnings for the day are $310.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Rebecca will have at the end of the day is \\(\\boxed{310}\\).",
