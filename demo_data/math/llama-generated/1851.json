Next, calculate the sum of the first four test scores:\n   \\[\n   85 + 79 + 92 + 84 = 340\n   \\]\n8. Substitute 340 into the equation:\n   \\[\n   340 + x = 425\n   \\]\n9. Solve for \\( x \\) by subtracting 340 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x = 425 - 340\n   \\]\n10. Calculate the result:\n    \\[\n    x = 85\n    \\]\n\nTherefore, Jacob must earn \\(\\boxed{85}\\) on his fifth and final test to have an overall average of 85.",
        "To determine the score Jacob needs on his fifth test to achieve an overall average of 85, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total score needed for all five tests:**\n   Since the desired average is 85, and there are 5 tests, the total score needed is:\n   \\[\n   85 \\times 5 = 425\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum the scores of the four tests Jacob has already taken:**\n   Jacob's scores are 85, 79, 92, and 84. Adding these together:\n   \\[\n   85 + 79 + 92 + 84\n   \\]\n\n   Let's break it down step by step:\n   \\[\n   85 + 79 = 164\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   164 + 92 = 256\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   256 + 84 = 340\n   \\]\n\n   So, the sum of the four test scores is 340.\n\n3. **Determine the score needed on the fifth test:**\n   To find out how much more Jacob needs to reach the total score of 425, we subtract the sum of his four test scores from the total score needed:\n   \\[\n   425 - 340 = 85\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jacob needs to earn \\(\\boxed{85}\\) on his fifth test to have an overall average of 85."
