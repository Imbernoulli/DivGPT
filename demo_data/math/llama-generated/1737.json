Since Mabel lives 4500 steps directly east of the school, we can calculate Helen's distance as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Helen's distance} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 4500\n   \\]\n   First, perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\times 4500 = \\frac{3 \\times 4500}{4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4500 = 13500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{13500}{4} = 3375\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Helen lives 3375 steps directly west of the school.\n\n2. **Determine the total distance Mabel needs to walk:**\n   Mabel needs to walk from her location (4500 steps east of the school) to Helen's location (3375 steps west of the school). The total distance she needs to walk is the sum of the distances from her to the school and from the school to Helen.\n\n   - Distance from Mabel to the school: 4500 steps\n   - Distance from the school to Helen: 3375 steps\n\n   Adding these two distances together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance} = 4500 + 3375\n   \\]\n\n   Perform the addition:\n   \\[\n   4500 + 3375 = 7875\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of steps Mabel will walk to visit Helen is \\(\\boxed{7875}\\).",
