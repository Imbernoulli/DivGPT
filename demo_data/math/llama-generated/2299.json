        "To determine how much change Sally received, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the photograph frames.\n2. Subtract the total cost from the amount Sally paid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the photograph frames. Sally bought 3 frames, and each frame costs $3. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ frames} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars per frame} = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost from the amount Sally paid.

Sally paid with a $20 bill, so we subtract $9 from $20:\n\\[ \\$20 - \\$9 = \\$11 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of change Sally received is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
