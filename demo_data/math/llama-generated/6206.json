Divide the remaining budget by the number of disco balls to find out how much he can spend on each disco ball.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the food. Calum needs to buy 10 boxes of food, and each box costs $25. So, the total cost of the food is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 25 = 250 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost of the food from Calum's budget to find out how much money is left for the disco balls. Calum's budget is $330, so the remaining budget for the disco balls is:\n\\[ 330 - 250 = 80 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we divide the remaining budget by the number of disco balls to find out how much he can spend on each disco ball. Calum needs to buy 4 disco balls, so the amount he can spend on each disco ball is:\n\\[ 80 \\div 4 = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Calum can afford to spend \\(\\boxed{20}\\) dollars on each disco ball.",

Divide the remaining budget by the number of disco balls to find out how much he can spend on each disco ball.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the food:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of food} = \\text{Number of boxes of food} \\times \\text{Cost per box of food} = 10 \\times 25 = 250\n   \\]\n\n2.

Divide the remaining budget by the number of disco balls to find out how much he can spend on each disco ball:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per disco ball} = \\frac{\\text{Remaining budget for disco balls}}{\\text{Number of disco balls}} = \\frac{80}{4} = 20\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Calum can afford to spend \\(\\boxed{20}\\) dollars on each disco ball.",
