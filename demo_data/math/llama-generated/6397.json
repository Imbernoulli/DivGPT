By the end of the decade, they have planted twice as many cherry trees as they originally planned and have now realized that falling cherry blossom leaves are causing a problem. Each tree drops 100 leaves each during the fall. If the town council originally intended to plant 7 cherry trees, how many leaves now fall from the trees?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
