        "To determine the total number of hours Bob logs in a month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours Bob works in a week.\n2. Determine the number of weeks in a month.\n3. Multiply the total weekly hours by the number of weeks in a month.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of hours Bob works in a week. Since he works 10 hours each day and he works 5 days a week, we multiply 10 hours by 5 days:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 50 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of weeks in a month. For simplicity, we'll assume there are 4 weeks in a month. Therefore, we multiply the weekly hours by 4 weeks:\n\n\\[ 50 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 200 \\text{ hours/month} \\]\n\nSo, the total number of hours Bob logs in a month is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]",
