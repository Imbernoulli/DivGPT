        "To determine how much money Emma has in her bank account now, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial amount of money Emma had in her bank account, which is $230.\n2. Subtract the amount she withdrew, which is $60.\n3. Add the amount she deposited the next week, which is twice the amount she withdrew.\n\nFirst, we subtract the $60 from the initial $230:\n\\[ 230 - 60 = 170 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the amount she deposited, which is twice the $60 she withdrew:\n\\[ 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\]\n\nThen, we add this $120 to the remaining $170:\n\\[ 170 + 120 = 290 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Emma has in her bank account now is \\(\\boxed{290}\\).",
