        "To determine how long Morgan can hula hoop, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how long Nancy can hula hoop.\n2. Calculate how long Casey can hula hoop based on Nancy's time.\n3. Calculate how long Morgan can hula hoop based on Casey's time.\n\nFirst, we know that Nancy can hula hoop for 10 minutes.\n\nNext, we need to find out how long Casey can hula hoop. Casey can hula hoop 3 minutes less than Nancy. Therefore, we subtract 3 minutes from Nancy's time:\n\\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \\]\nSo, Casey can hula hoop for 7 minutes.\n\nNow, we need to find out how long Morgan can hula hoop. Morgan can hula hoop three times as long as Casey. Therefore, we multiply Casey's time by 3:\n\\[ 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\]\nSo, Morgan can hula hoop for 21 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{21} \\]",
