        "To determine the number of orange balls Adam has, we start by calculating the total number of pink and orange balls. Adam has a total of 50 balls, with 20 red and 10 blue balls. Therefore, the number of pink and orange balls combined is:\n\n\\[ 50 - 20 - 10 = 20 \\]\n\nLet's denote the number of orange balls by \\( x \\). According to the problem, there are 3 times as many pink balls as orange balls. Thus, the number of pink balls is \\( 3x \\). Since the total number of pink and orange balls is 20, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ x + 3x = 20 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ 4x = 20 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{20}{4} = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of orange balls is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
