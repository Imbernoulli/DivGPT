        "To determine how many eggs are left on the shelf, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs Addilynn bought.\n2. Determine how many eggs were used after two weeks.\n3. Find out how many eggs were broken.\n4. Calculate the number of eggs remaining on the shelf.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of eggs Addilynn bought. Since she bought six dozen eggs, and one dozen equals 12 eggs, we have:\n\\[\n6 \\times 12 = 72\n\\]\nSo, Addilynn bought 72 eggs.\n\nNext, we determine how many eggs were used after two weeks. She used half of the eggs, so:\n\\[\n\\frac{72}{2} = 36\n\\]\nThis means she used 36 eggs, so the number of eggs remaining after two weeks is:\n\\[\n72 - 36 = 36\n\\]\n\nThen, we find out how many eggs were broken. She broke 15 eggs, so the number of eggs remaining after breaking some is:\n\\[\n36 - 15 = 21\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of eggs left on the shelf is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{21}\n\\]",
