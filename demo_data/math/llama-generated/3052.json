Du Chin uses \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the sales to buy ingredients:\n\\[\n\\text{Money set aside} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\$4000 = \\frac{3 \\times 4000}{5} = \\frac{12000}{5} = \\$2400\n\\]\n\nFinally, subtract the amount set aside from the total sales to find out how much money Du Chin remains with:\n\\[\n\\text{Money remaining} = \\$4000 - \\$2400 = \\$1600\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Du Chin remains with after setting aside the money for buying ingredients is \\(\\boxed{1600}\\).",
        "To determine how much money Du Chin remains with after setting aside the money for buying ingredients, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total sales for the day.\n2.

Subtract the amount set aside for ingredients from the total sales to find out how much money Du Chin remains with.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total sales for the day.\n   Du Chin bakes 200 meat pies and sells each for $20.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total sales} = 200 \\times 20 = 4000\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine how much money is set aside for buying ingredients.\n   Du Chin uses \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of the sales to buy ingredients.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount set aside for ingredients} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 4000 = \\frac{3 \\times 4000}{5} = \\frac{12000}{5} = 2400\n   \\]\n\n3.
