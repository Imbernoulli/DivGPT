        "To determine the total number of calories Dimitri will consume after two days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of burgers Dimitri eats in one day.\n2. Determine the total calories from the burgers eaten in one day.\n3. Calculate the total calories from the burgers eaten in two days.\n\nFirst, we know that Dimitri eats 3 burgers per day. Each burger contains 20 calories. Therefore, the total number of calories he consumes in one day is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ burgers/day} \\times 20 \\text{ calories/burger} = 60 \\text{ calories/day} \\]\n\nNext, to find out how many calories he consumes in two days, we multiply the daily calorie intake by 2:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ calories/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 120 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of calories Dimitri will get after two days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]",

Therefore, the total number of calories he consumes in one day is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ burgers/day} \\times 20 \\text{ calories/burger} = 60 \\text{ calories/day} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many calories he consumes in two days. Since he consumes 60 calories per day, the total number of calories for two days is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ calories/day} \\times 2 \\text{ days} = 120 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of calories Dimitri will get after two days is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of calories Dimitri will consume after two days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of burgers Dimitri eats in one day.\n2.
