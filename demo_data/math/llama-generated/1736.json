        "To determine John's new height after his growth spurt, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total growth over the 3 months.\n2. Add the total growth to John's original height.\n3. Convert the final height from inches to feet.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total growth over the 3 months.**\n\nJohn grew 2 inches per month for 3 months.\n\\[\n2 \\text{ inches/month} \\times 3 \\text{ months} = 6 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Add the total growth to John's original height.**\n\nJohn's original height was 66 inches. Adding the growth of 6 inches:\n\\[\n66 \\text{ inches} + 6 \\text{ inches} = 72 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert the final height from inches to feet.**\n\nThere are 12 inches in a foot.

        "To determine John's height after his growth spurt, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total growth over the 3 months.\n2. Add the total growth to John's original height.\n3. Convert the final height from inches to feet.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total growth over the 3 months. John grew 2 inches per month for 3 months:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ inches/month} \\times 3 \\text{ months} = 6 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNext, we add this growth to John's original height of 66 inches:\n\\[ 66 \\text{ inches} + 6 \\text{ inches} = 72 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNow, we need to convert 72 inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide 72 by 12:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ inches} \\div 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 6 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, John's height is \\(\\boxed{6}\\) feet."
