        "To determine how much money Steve kept from the sales of his book, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of copies sold after the advance:**\n   Steve sold 1,000,000 copies, and he got an advance for 100,000 copies. Therefore, the number of copies sold after the advance is:\n   \\[\n   1,000,000 - 100,000 = 900,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total revenue from the copies sold after the advance:**\n   Steve earns $2 per copy. Thus, the total revenue from 900,000 copies is:\n   \\[\n   900,000 \\times 2 = 1,800,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the amount the agent takes:**\n   Steve's agent takes 10% of the total revenue. Therefore, the amount the agent takes is:\n   \\[\n   0.10 \\times 1,800,000 = 180,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how much money Steve keeps:**\n   After subtracting the agent's commission from the total revenue, the amount Steve keeps is:\n   \\[\n   1,800,000 - 180,000 = 1,620,000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Steve kept not counting the money from the advance is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1620000}\n\\]",

Determine the total earnings from these sales.\n3. Subtract the agent's commission from the total earnings.\n\nFirst, we find out how many copies were sold beyond the advance. Since the book sold 1,000,000 copies and Steve got an advance for 100,000 copies, the number of copies sold beyond the advance is:\n\\[ 1,000,000 - 100,000 = 900,000 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total earnings from these 900,000 copies. Since Steve gets $2 for each copy sold, the total earnings are:\n\\[ 900,000 \\times 2 = 1,800,000 \\]\n\nThen, we need to subtract the agent's commission from the total earnings. The agent takes 10% of the total earnings, so the agent's commission is:\n\\[ 1,800,000 \\times 0.10 = 180,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Steve kept, not counting the money from the advance, is:\n\\[ 1,800,000 - 180,000 = 1,620,000 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1620000} \\]",
