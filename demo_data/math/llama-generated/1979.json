        "To determine the number of grandchildren Max has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of children Max has.\n2. Determine how many of Max's children have 8 children each.\n3. Determine how many of Max's children have 5 children each.\n4. Calculate the total number of grandchildren by multiplying the number of children who have 8 children each by 8, and the number of children who have 5 children each by 5, and then summing these two products.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Max has 8 children.\n2. Out of these 8 children, 6 have 8 children each (since 2 have 5 children each).\n3. The remaining 2 children have 5 children each.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of grandchildren:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Grandchildren from children with 8 children each} = 6 \\times 8 = 48\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Grandchildren from children with 5 children each} = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of grandchildren} = 48 + 10 = 58\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of grandchildren Max has is \\(\\boxed{58}\\).",
        "To determine how many grandchildren Max has, we need to consider the number of children each of his children has. Max has 8 children, and each of these children has either 8 or 5 children themselves.\n\nFirst, let's identify how many of Max's children have 8 children each and how many have 5 children each. We know that 2 of his children have 5 children each. Therefore, the number of children who have 8 children each is:\n\\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of grandchildren from the children who have 8 children each. Since there are 6 such children, the total number of grandchildren from these children is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total number of grandchildren from the children who have 5 children each. Since there are 2 such children, the total number of grandchildren from these children is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of grandchildren from both groups to find the total number of grandchildren Max has:\n\\[ 48 + 10 = 58 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of grandchildren Max has is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{58}\n\\]",
