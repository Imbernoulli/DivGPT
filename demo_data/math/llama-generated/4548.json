Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{250}{1250} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction \\(\\frac{250}{1250}\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{250}{1250} = \\frac{1}{5} \\]\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\right) \\times 100 = 20\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the sandwich's total calories that come from bacon is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
        "To determine what percentage of the sandwich's total calories come from bacon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total calories from the bacon.\n2. Determine the percentage of the sandwich's total calories that the bacon calories represent.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total calories from the bacon. Ben has two strips of bacon, and each strip has 125 calories. Therefore, the total calories from the bacon are:\n\\[ 2 \\times 125 = 250 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out what percentage 250 calories is of the sandwich's total calories. The sandwich has 1250 calories in total. The percentage is calculated by dividing the calories from the bacon by the total calories of the sandwich and then multiplying by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{250}{1250} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.2 \\times 100 = 20\\% \\]\n\nSo, the percentage of the sandwich's total calories that come from bacon is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
