        "To determine how much money John spent at the arcade, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of minutes John played.\n2. Determine how many 6-minute intervals are in the total number of minutes.\n3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of 6-minute intervals.\n\nFirst, we convert the total playing time from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and John played for 3 hours, we have:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many 6-minute intervals are in 180 minutes. We do this by dividing 180 by 6:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ minutes} \\div 6 \\text{ minutes/interval} = 30 \\text{ intervals} \\]\n\nSince John uses $0.50 for each 6-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the cost per interval:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ intervals} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/interval} = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money John spent is:\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]",

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes per hour:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many 6-minute intervals are in 180 minutes. We do this by dividing 180 minutes by 6 minutes per interval:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ minutes} \\div 6 \\text{ minutes/interval} = 30 \\text{ intervals} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of intervals by the cost per interval. Since each 6-minute interval costs $0.50, we multiply 30 intervals by $0.50 per interval:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ intervals} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/interval} = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money John spent is \\(\\boxed{15}\\) dollars.",

To find out how many 6-minute intervals there are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 6:\n   \\[\n   180 \\text{ minutes} \\div 6 \\text{ minutes/interval} = 30 \\text{ intervals}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   John spends $0.50 for each 6-minute interval. Therefore, the total amount of money he spends is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ intervals} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/interval} = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money John spent is \\(\\boxed{15}\\) dollars.",
