        "Let's start by determining the initial stock of ornamental rings in the store before Eliza buys any. Let's denote the initial stock by \\( x \\). According to the problem, Eliza buys 200 ornamental rings, which is twice the number of the remaining stock.

After Eliza buys 200 more rings, the total stock becomes:\n\n\\[ 100 + 200 = 300 \\]\n\nNext, Eliza sells \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the total stock. The number of rings sold is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} \\times 300 = 225 \\]\n\nAfter selling 225 rings, the remaining stock is:\n\n\\[ 300 - 225 = 75 \\]\n\nThen, Eliza's mother buys 300 more rings. The new total stock is:\n\n\\[ 75 + 300 = 375 \\]\n\nAfter three days, Eliza's mother sells 150 rings.
