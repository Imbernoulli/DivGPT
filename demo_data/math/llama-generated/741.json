To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because she can't buy a fraction of a pack.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{40 \\text{ seeds}}{25 \\text{ seeds per pack}} = 1.6\n\\]\n\nSince she can't buy a fraction of a pack, she needs to buy 2 packs.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the packs of seeds.**\n\nEach pack costs $5, so the total cost for 2 packs is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ packs} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars per pack} = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Madeline will spend \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars on seeds to plant 20 flowers.",
