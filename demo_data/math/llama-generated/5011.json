        "Let's define the number of goats as \\( g \\). According to the problem, the farmer has 4 more cows than goats, so the number of cows is \\( g + 4 \\). The farmer also has twice as many pigs as cows, so the number of pigs is \\( 2(g + 4) \\).\n\nThe total number of animals is the sum of the number of goats, cows, and pigs. We are given that the total number of animals is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\ng + (g + 4) + 2(g + 4) = 56\n\\]\n\nFirst, simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[\ng + g + 4 + 2g + 8 = 56\n\\]\n\\[\n4g + 12 = 56\n\\]\n\nNext, isolate the term with \\( g \\) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n4g = 44\n\\]\n\nThen, solve for \\( g \\) by dividing both sides by 4:\n\\[\ng = 11\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of goats is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).\n\nTo verify, we can calculate the number of cows and pigs. The number of cows is \\( g + 4 = 11 + 4 = 15 \\), and the number of pigs is \\( 2(g + 4) = 2 \\times 15 = 30 \\). Adding these together, we get:\n\\[\n11 + 15 + 30 = 56\n\\]\nwhich confirms that our solution is correct. Therefore, the number of goats is indeed \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
        "Let's define the number of goats the farmer has as \\( g \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the farmer has 4 more cows than goats. Therefore, the number of cows can be expressed as:\n\\[\nc = g + 4\n\\]\n\nThe problem also states that the farmer has twice as many pigs as cows. Therefore, the number of pigs can be expressed as:\n\\[\np = 2c\n\\]\n\nWe know the total number of animals the farmer has is 56. This total includes goats, cows, and pigs. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\ng + c + p = 56\n\\]\n\nNext, we substitute the expressions for \\( c \\) and \\( p \\) into the total equation:\n\\[\ng + (g + 4) + 2(g + 4) = 56\n\\]\n\nFirst, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\\[\ng + g + 4 + 2g + 8 = 56\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n4g + 12 = 56\n\\]\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( g \\):\n\\[\n4g = 44\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4 to solve for \\( g \\):\n\\[\ng = 11\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of goats the farmer has is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",

We are given that the total number of animals is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ g + (g + 4) + 2(g + 4) = 56 \\]\n\nNow, let's simplify and solve this equation step by step:\n1. Distribute the 2 in the term \\( 2(g + 4) \\):\n\\[ g + g + 4 + 2g + 8 = 56 \\]\n2. Combine like terms:\n\\[ 4g + 12 = 56 \\]\n3. Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 4g = 44 \\]\n4.

Let's define the variables as follows:\n- Let \\( g \\) be the number of goats.\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of cows.\n- Let \\( p \\) be the number of pigs.\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following:\n1. The farmer has twice as many pigs as cows, which can be written as:\n   \\[\n   p = 2c\n   \\]\n2. The farmer has 4 more cows than goats, which can be written as:\n   \\[\n   c = g + 4\n   \\]\n3. The total number of animals is 56, which can be written as:\n   \\[\n   p + c + g = 56\n   \\]\n\nFirst, we substitute the expression for \\( c \\) from the second equation into the first equation to express \\( p \\) in terms of \\( g \\):\n\\[\np = 2(g + 4) = 2g + 8\n\\]\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for \\( p \\) and \\( c \\) into the third equation:\n\\[\n(2g + 8) + (g + 4) + g = 56\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n2g + 8 + g + 4 + g = 56\n\\]\n\\[\n4g + 12 = 56\n\\]\n\nNext, isolate \\( g \\) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n4g = 44\n\\]\n\nThen, solve for \\( g \\) by dividing both sides by 4:\n\\[\ng = 11\n\\]\n\nSo, the farmer has \\(\\boxed{11}\\) goats. To verify, we can find the number of cows and pigs:\n\\[\nc = g + 4 = 11 + 4 = 15\n\\]\n\\[\np = 2c = 2 \\times 15 = 30\n\\]\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[\np + c + g = 30 + 15 + 11 = 56\n\\]\n\nThe total number of animals is indeed 56, confirming that our solution is correct.
