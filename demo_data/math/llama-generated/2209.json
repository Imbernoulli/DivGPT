        "To determine how many shirts were missing, we need to first calculate the total cost of the trousers and shirts Leo initially dropped off based on the given information. We know that Leo dropped off 10 pairs of trousers and some shirts, and he was charged a total of $140. The cost per pair of trousers is $9, and the cost per shirt is $5.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the trousers:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ pairs of trousers} \\times 9 \\text{ dollars per pair} = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's denote the number of shirts Leo dropped off as \\( x \\).

Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\n9 \\times 10 + 5 \\times x = 140\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n90 + 5x = 140\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate the term with \\( x \\) by subtracting 90 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n5x = 50\n\\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 5:\n\n\\[\nx = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, Leo originally dropped off 10 shirts. According to the attendant, Leo dropped off only 2 shirts. Therefore, the number of shirts missing is:\n\n\\[\n10 - 2 = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of shirts missing is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
        "To determine how many shirts were missing, we need to first calculate the total cost of the trousers Leo dropped off. Leo dropped off 10 pairs of trousers, and each pair costs $9. Therefore, the cost for the trousers is:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we know that the total bill was $140. If we subtract the cost of the trousers from the total bill, we will find out how much Leo paid for the shirts:\n\n\\[ 140 - 90 = 50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince each shirt costs $5, we can find out how many shirts Leo dropped off by dividing the total cost of the shirts by the cost per shirt:\n\n\\[ 50 \\div 5 = 10 \\text{ shirts} \\]\n\nLeo dropped off 10 shirts, but the attendant only found 2 shirts.
