        "To determine the total amount Clinton spends on lunch over 5 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of one burger meal with up-sized fries and drink.\n2. Multiply the cost of one meal by the number of days.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of one burger meal with up-sized fries and drink:\n- The base cost of the burger meal is $6.00.\n- The cost to up size the fries and drink is $1.00.\n- Therefore, the total cost of one meal is \\(6.00 + 1.00 = 7.00\\) dollars.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost for 5 days:\n- The cost of one meal is $7.00.\n- Clinton buys this meal every day for 5 days.\n- Therefore, the total cost for 5 days is \\(7.00 \\times 5 = 35.00\\) dollars.\n\nSo, the total amount Clinton spends on lunch over 5 days is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",
