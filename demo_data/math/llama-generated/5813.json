        "To determine how many more square inches the area of the first rectangle is compared to the second, we need to calculate the area of each rectangle and then find the difference between these areas.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the first rectangle. The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA = \\text{width} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\nFor the first rectangle, the width is 4 inches and the height is 5 inches. Therefore, the area of the first rectangle is:\n\\[\nA_1 = 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the area of the second rectangle. The width is 3 inches and the height is 6 inches. Therefore, the area of the second rectangle is:\n\\[\nA_2 = 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the area of the first rectangle and the area of the second rectangle:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = A_1 - A_2 = 20 - 18 = 2 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the first rectangle is \\(\\boxed{2}\\) square inches more than the area of the second rectangle.",
