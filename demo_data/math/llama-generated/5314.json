        "To determine the cost of an adult ticket, we start by defining variables for the costs of the tickets. Let \\( x \\) be the cost of a child ticket in dollars. Since the cost of an adult ticket is $6 more than the cost of a child ticket, the cost of an adult ticket is \\( x + 6 \\) dollars.\n\nThe family consists of 2 adults and 3 children, so the total cost of the tickets is the sum of the costs of the adult tickets and the child tickets. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ 2(x + 6) + 3x = 77 \\]\n\nNext, we expand and simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 2x + 12 + 3x = 77 \\]\n\\[ 5x + 12 = 77 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 5x = 65 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 5:\n\\[ x = 13 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of a child ticket is $13. Since the cost of an adult ticket is $6 more than the cost of a child ticket, we add 6 to 13:\n\\[ x + 6 = 13 + 6 = 19 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of an adult ticket is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).",
        "Let's denote the cost of a child ticket as \\( x \\) dollars. According to the problem, the cost of an adult ticket is \\( x + 6 \\) dollars.

        "Let's define the cost of a child ticket as \\( x \\) dollars. Since the cost of an adult ticket is $6 more than the cost of a child ticket, the cost of an adult ticket is \\( x + 6 \\) dollars.\n\nThe family consists of 2 adults and 3 children, so they buy 2 adult tickets and 3 child tickets. The total cost of the tickets is given as $77. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:\n\n\\[ 2(x + 6) + 3x = 77 \\]\n\nFirst, we expand the equation by distributing the 2 through the parentheses:\n\n\\[ 2x + 12 + 3x = 77 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 5x + 12 = 77 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 5x = 65 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[ x = 13 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of a child ticket is $13. Since the cost of an adult ticket is $6 more than the cost of a child ticket, we add 6 to 13:\n\n\\[ x + 6 = 13 + 6 = 19 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of an adult ticket is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).",

        "To determine the cost of an adult ticket, let's define the variables first. Let \\( c \\) be the cost of a child ticket.

        "To determine the cost of an adult ticket, we start by defining the variables for the costs of the tickets. Let \\( c \\) represent the cost of a child ticket in dollars. Since the cost of an adult ticket is $6 more than the cost of a child ticket, we can express the cost of an adult ticket as \\( c + 6 \\) dollars.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the tickets for the family. Mr. and Mrs. Boyden are two adults, and they have three children. Therefore, the total cost of the tickets is the sum of the costs of the two adult tickets and the three child tickets:\n\\[\n2(c + 6) + 3c = 77\n\\]\n\nWe simplify the left-hand side of the equation by distributing the 2:\n\\[\n2c + 12 + 3c = 77\n\\]\n\nCombine the like terms \\( 2c \\) and \\( 3c \\):\n\\[\n5c + 12 = 77\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( c \\), subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n5c = 65\n\\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 5:\n\\[\nc = 13\n\\]\n\nNow that we know the cost of a child ticket is $13, we can find the cost of an adult ticket by adding $6 to the cost of a child ticket:\n\\[\nc + 6 = 13 + 6 = 19\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of an adult ticket is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).",
