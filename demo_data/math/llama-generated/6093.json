        "To determine how many female fish Ariel has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of male fish.\n2. Subtract the number of male fish from the total number of fish to find the number of female fish.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of male fish. Ariel has 45 fish in total, and 2/3 of them are male.
