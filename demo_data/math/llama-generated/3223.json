        "To determine how many eggs Tricia has left to make sunny-side-up eggs for breakfast, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs Tricia ordered.\n2. Determine how many eggs she will use for making crepes.\n3. Calculate how many eggs remain after making crepes.\n4. Determine how many eggs she will use for making cupcakes.\n5. Calculate how many eggs remain after making cupcakes.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Tricia ordered three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen equals:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 12 = 36 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n2. She will use \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the eggs for making crepes. Therefore, the number of eggs used for crepes is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 36 = 9 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n3. After making crepes, the number of eggs remaining is:\n   \\[\n   36 - 9 = 27 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n4. She will use \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the remaining eggs for making cupcakes. Therefore, the number of eggs used for making cupcakes is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times 27 = 18 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n5. After making cupcakes, the number of eggs remaining is:\n   \\[\n   27 - 18 = 9 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of eggs left to make sunny-side-up eggs for breakfast is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",

So, the number of eggs used for crepes is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 36 = 9 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n3. The number of eggs remaining after making crepes is:\n   \\[\n   36 - 9 = 27 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n4. She will use \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the remaining eggs for making cupcakes. So, the number of eggs used for making cupcakes is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times 27 = 18 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n5. The number of eggs left after making cupcakes is:\n   \\[\n   27 - 18 = 9 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of eggs left to make sunny-side-up eggs for breakfast is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
