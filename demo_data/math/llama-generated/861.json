Therefore, the volume of air inhaled in 24 hours is:\n\\[ \\frac{5100}{9} \\times 24 = \\frac{5100 \\times 24}{9} = \\frac{122400}{9} = 13600 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\nThus, the volume of air inhaled by Ross in 24 hours is:\n\\[ \\boxed{13600} \\]",
        "To determine the total volume of air Ross inhales in 24 hours, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the volume of air inhaled in one minute.\n2. Calculate the volume of air inhaled in one hour.\n3. Calculate the volume of air inhaled in 24 hours.\n\nFirst, we calculate the volume of air inhaled in one minute. Ross takes 17 breaths per minute, and each breath is 5/9 liter of air. Therefore, the volume of air inhaled in one minute is:\n\\[\n17 \\times \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{85}{9} \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the volume of air inhaled in one hour. There are 60 minutes in one hour, so the volume of air inhaled in one hour is:\n\\[\n60 \\times \\frac{85}{9} = \\frac{60 \\times 85}{9} = \\frac{5100}{9} \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the volume of air inhaled in 24 hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so the volume of air inhaled in 24 hours is:\n\\[\n24 \\times \\frac{5100}{9} = \\frac{24 \\times 5100}{9} = \\frac{122400}{9} = 13600 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total volume of air inhaled in 24 hours is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{13600}\n\\]"
