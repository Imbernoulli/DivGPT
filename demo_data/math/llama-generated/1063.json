        "To determine how many apples are in each slice of pie, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of apples Cassandra bought:**\n   Cassandra bought four dozen Granny Smith apples. Since one dozen equals 12 apples:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 12 = 48 \\text{ apples}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of pie slices:**\n   Cassandra made four apple pies and cut each pie into 6 large pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 6 = 24 \\text{ slices}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of apples per slice:**\n   To find out how many apples are in each slice, we divide the total number of apples by the total number of slices:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{48 \\text{ apples}}{24 \\text{ slices}} = 2 \\text{ apples per slice}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of apples in each slice of pie is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
