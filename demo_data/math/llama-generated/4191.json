        "To determine when Pete should leave, we need to work backwards from the latest time he can arrive in LA, which is 0900 hours.

First, we subtract the time it takes to walk to the train station from 0900 hours.\n   - Pete's walk takes 10 minutes.\n   - Therefore, he needs to leave the house by \\(0900 - 0010 = 0850\\) hours.\n\n2.
