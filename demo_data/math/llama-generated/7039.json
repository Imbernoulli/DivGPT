        "To determine how many people ordered chocolate ice cream on Saturday, we start by finding out how many people ordered vanilla ice cream. We know that 20% of the 220 people ordered vanilla ice cream. Therefore, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 220 = 44\n\\]\n\nSo, 44 people ordered vanilla ice cream. According to the problem, the number of people who ordered vanilla ice cream is twice the number of people who ordered chocolate ice cream. Let \\( x \\) be the number of people who ordered chocolate ice cream. Then we have:\n\n\\[\n44 = 2x\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{44}{2} = 22\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people who ordered chocolate ice cream is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",
        "To determine how many people ordered chocolate ice cream, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of people who ordered vanilla ice cream.\n2. Use the given relationship between the number of people who ordered vanilla and chocolate ice cream to find the number of people who ordered chocolate ice cream.\n\nFirst, we know that 20% of the 220 people ordered vanilla ice cream. So, we calculate the number of people who ordered vanilla ice cream as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of people who ordered vanilla ice cream} = 20\\% \\times 220 = 0.20 \\times 220 = 44\n\\]\n\nNext, we know from the problem statement that there were twice as many people who ordered vanilla ice cream as ordered chocolate ice cream. Let \\( C \\) be the number of people who ordered chocolate ice cream. Then, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of people who ordered vanilla ice cream} = 2C\n\\]\nWe already know that the number of people who ordered vanilla ice cream is 44, so we substitute 44 into the equation:\n\\[\n44 = 2C\n\\]\nTo find \\( C \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\nC = \\frac{44}{2} = 22\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of people who ordered chocolate ice cream is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",
