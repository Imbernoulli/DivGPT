        "To determine how much money James has at the end of the year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount James invests over the course of the year.\n2. Add this amount to his initial balance.\n3. Calculate the windfall he receives.\n4. Add the windfall to the total amount in his account at the end of the year.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount James invests over the course of the year. Since there are 52 weeks in a year and he invests $2000 each week, we have:\n\\[\n52 \\times 2000 = 104000\n\\]\nSo, James invests $104,000 over the year.\n\nNext, we add this amount to his initial balance of $250,000:\n\\[\n250000 + 104000 = 354000\n\\]\nSo, at the end of the year, before the windfall, James has $354,000 in his account.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the windfall. The windfall is worth 50% more than what he has in his account at the end of the year before the windfall. Therefore, the windfall is:\n\\[\n354000 \\times 1.5 = 531000\n\\]\nSo, the windfall is $531,000.\n\nFinally, we add the windfall to the total amount in his account at the end of the year before the windfall:\n\\[\n354000 + 531000 = 885000\n\\]\nSo, at the end of the year, James has \\(\\boxed{885000}\\) dollars.",
