        "To determine Grant's test score, we need to follow the information given step by step.\n\n1. First, we find out how many points John scored. According to the problem, John received twice as many points as Hunter. Hunter scored 45 points, so:\n   \\[\n   \\text{John's score} = 2 \\times 45 = 90\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we find out how many points Grant scored. The problem states that Grant scored 10 points higher than John. Since John scored 90 points, Grant's score is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Grant's score} = 90 + 10 = 100\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Grant's test score is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
