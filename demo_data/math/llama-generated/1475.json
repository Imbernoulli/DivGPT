Use the information given to set up an equation to find the total number of students registered.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many students attended class today. We know that ten percent less than twice the total number of students present in the science class yesterday have attended class today. The number of students present in the class yesterday was 70. So, we calculate twice this number:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 70 = 140 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find ten percent less than 140. Ten percent of 140 is:\n\n\\[ 0.10 \\times 140 = 14 \\]\n\nSo, ten percent less than 140 is:\n\n\\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \\]\n\nThis means that 126 students attended class today. We are also given that 30 students are absent today. Therefore, the total number of students registered for the course is the sum of the students who attended class today and the students who are absent today:\n\n\\[ 126 + 30 = 156 \\]\n\nSo, the number of students registered for the course is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{156} \\]",

According to the problem, ten percent less than twice the total number of students present in the science class yesterday have attended class today.\n\nThe number of students present in the class yesterday was 70. Therefore, twice the number of students present yesterday is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 70 = 140 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find ten percent less than 140. Ten percent of 140 is:\n\\[ 0.10 \\times 140 = 14 \\]\n\nSo, ten percent less than 140 is:\n\\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \\]\n\nThis means that 126 students attended class today.

Add the number of students who attended class today to the number of students who are absent today to find the total number of students registered for the course.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of students who attended class today. According to the problem, ten percent less than twice the total number of students present in the science class yesterday have attended class today.\n\nThe total number of students present in the class yesterday is 70. Therefore, twice the number of students present yesterday is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 70 = 140 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find ten percent less than 140. Ten percent of 140 is:\n\\[ 0.10 \\times 140 = 14 \\]\n\nSo, ten percent less than 140 is:\n\\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \\]\n\nThis means that 126 students attended class today. Since 30 students are absent today, the total number of students registered for the course is:\n\\[ 126 + 30 = 156 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students registered for the course is:\n\\[ \\boxed{156} \\]"
