        "Let's start by determining the number of pairs of shoes each person has, beginning with Brian.\n\nBrian has 22 pairs of shoes.\n\nNext, we know that Edward has 3 times the number of pairs of shoes Brian has. Therefore, we calculate Edward's pairs of shoes as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\times 22 = 66\n\\]\n\nJacob has half the number of pairs of shoes Edward has. Thus, we calculate Jacob's pairs of shoes as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{66}{2} = 33\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum up the pairs of shoes each person has to find the total number of pairs of shoes:\n\\[\n22 + 66 + 33 = 121\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pairs of shoes they have is \\boxed{121}.",
