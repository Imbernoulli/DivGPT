She reads 30 percent of the remaining pages, which is:\n\\[\n\\text{Pages read in the second week} = 0.30 \\times 300 = 90\n\\]\nAfter the second week, the number of pages remaining is:\n\\[\n\\text{Pages remaining after the second week} = 300 - 90 = 210\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of pages Coral must read the third week to finish the book is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]",

Calculate the number of pages Coral must read in the third week.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Coral reads half of the book in the first week.
