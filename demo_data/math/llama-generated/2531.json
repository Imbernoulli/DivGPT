        "To determine how many points their teammates made, we need to calculate the scores of Lizzie, Nathalie, and Aimee first, and then subtract their total score from the team's overall score.\n\n1. **Lizzie's score:**\n   Lizzie scored 4 points.\n\n2. **Nathalie's score:**\n   Nathalie's score is 3 more than Lizzie's score.

        "To determine how many points Lizzie's teammates made, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Nathalie's score.\n2. Calculate Aimee's score.\n3. Find the total score of Lizzie, Nathalie, and Aimee.\n4. Subtract the total score of Lizzie, Nathalie, and Aimee from the team's total score to find the points made by their teammates.\n\nLet's start with Nathalie's score. Nathalie's score is 3 more than Lizzie's score. Since Lizzie scored 4 points, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Nathalie's score} = 4 + 3 = 7\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate Aimee's score. Aimee's score is twice the score of Lizzie and Nathalie combined. The combined score of Lizzie and Nathalie is:\n\\[\n\\text{Combined score of Lizzie and Nathalie} = 4 + 7 = 11\n\\]\nSo, Aimee's score is:\n\\[\n\\text{Aimee's score} = 2 \\times 11 = 22\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the total score of Lizzie, Nathalie, and Aimee:\n\\[\n\\text{Total score of Lizzie, Nathalie, and Aimee} = 4 + 7 + 22 = 33\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total score of Lizzie, Nathalie, and Aimee from the team's total score to find the points made by their teammates:\n\\[\n\\text{Points made by teammates} = 50 - 33 = 17\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of points made by their teammates is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{17}\n\\]",
