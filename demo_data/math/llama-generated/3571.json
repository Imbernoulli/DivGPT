Each parent gets a cake on their birthday. Therefore, each parent gets 1 cake per year. Since she has 2 parents, the total number of cakes for her parents per year is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ parents} \\times 1 \\text{ cake/parent} = 2 \\text{ cakes/year} \\]\n\nAdding up the cakes for all family members per year, we get:\n\\[ 8 \\text{ cakes/year} + 6 \\text{ cakes/year} + 2 \\text{ cakes/year} = 16 \\text{ cakes/year} \\]\n\nTo find the total number of cakes Ginger makes in 10 years, we multiply the number of cakes per year by 10:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ cakes/year} \\times 10 \\text{ years} = 160 \\text{ cakes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cakes Ginger makes in 10 years is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{160}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of cakes Ginger makes in 10 years, we need to calculate the number of cakes she makes for each family member and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Children:**\n   - Each child gets a cake on their birthday, Christmas, Easter, and Halloween.\n   - There are 4 holidays per year.\n   - Ginger has 2 children.\n   - Total cakes per child per year: \\(4 \\text{ holidays} \\times 1 \\text{ cake/holiday} = 4 \\text{ cakes}\\).\n   - Total cakes per year for 2 children: \\(4 \\text{ cakes/child} \\times 2 \\text{ children} = 8 \\text{ cakes}\\).\n\n2. **Husband:**\n   - The husband gets a cake on his birthday, Christmas, Easter, Halloween, their anniversary, and Valentine's Day.\n   - There are 6 holidays per year.\n   - Total cakes per year for the husband: \\(6 \\text{ holidays} \\times 1 \\text{ cake/holiday} = 6 \\text{ cakes}\\).\n\n3. **Parents:**\n   - Each parent gets a cake on their birthday.\n   - There are 2 holidays per year (one for each parent).\n   - Total cakes per year for both parents: \\(1 \\text{ cake/parent} \\times 2 \\text{ parents} = 2 \\text{ cakes}\\).\n\nNext, we sum up the total number of cakes per year for all family members:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ cakes (children)} + 6 \\text{ cakes (husband)} + 2 \\text{ cakes (parents)} = 16 \\text{ cakes per year}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of cakes over 10 years:\n\\[\n16 \\text{ cakes per year} \\times 10 \\text{ years} = 160 \\text{ cakes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of cakes Ginger makes in 10 years is \\(\\boxed{160}\\)."
