        "To determine how many more white socks Andy still has than black socks after losing half of his white socks, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of black socks Andy has.\n   Andy has 6 black socks.\n\n2. Determine how many white socks Andy has initially.\n   Andy has 4 times as many white socks as black socks. Since he has 6 black socks, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 6 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, Andy initially has 24 white socks.\n\n3. Calculate how many white socks Andy has after losing half of his white socks.\n   Andy loses half of his white socks, so we find half of 24:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n   \\]\n   So, after losing half of his white socks, Andy has 12 white socks.\n\n4. Determine how many more white socks Andy has than black socks.\n   Andy has 12 white socks and 6 black socks, so we subtract the number of black socks from the number of white socks:\n   \\[\n   12 - 6 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, Andy still has 6 more white socks than black socks.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",

Determine the initial number of white socks Andy has.\n2. Calculate the number of white socks Andy has after losing half.\n3. Find the difference between the remaining white socks and the black socks.\n\nFirst, we know that Andy has 4 times as many white socks as he has black socks. If Andy has 6 black socks, then the number of white socks he has is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, Andy loses half of his white socks. Therefore, the number of white socks he has after losing half is:\n\\[ \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more white socks Andy has than black socks. Since he has 12 white socks and 6 black socks, the difference is:\n\\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \\]\n\nThus, Andy still has \\(\\boxed{6}\\) more white socks than black socks.",

Since he loses half of his white socks, we divide the number of white socks by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n   \\]\n   So, Andy has 12 white socks left.\n4. Calculate how many more white socks Andy has than black socks. We subtract the number of black socks from the number of white socks he has left:\n   \\[\n   12 - 6 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, Andy still has 6 more white socks than black socks.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",

Find the difference between the number of white socks remaining and the number of black socks.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many white socks Andy initially has. We know that Andy has 4 times as many white socks as he has black socks. Since he has 6 black socks, we can calculate the number of white socks as follows:\n\\[\n4 \\times 6 = 24\n\\]\nSo, Andy initially has 24 white socks.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many white socks Andy has after losing half of them. Since he loses half of his white socks, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{2} = 12\n\\]\nSo, Andy has 12 white socks left after losing half of them.\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the number of white socks remaining and the number of black socks. Andy has 12 white socks and 6 black socks, so the difference is:\n\\[\n12 - 6 = 6\n\\]\nTherefore, Andy still has \\(\\boxed{6}\\) more white socks than black socks.",

Since Andy has 4 times as many white socks as he has black socks, we multiply the number of black socks by 4:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 6 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, Andy initially has 24 white socks.\n3. Determine how many white socks Andy has after losing half of them. Since he loses half of his white socks, we divide the number of white socks by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n   \\]\n   So, Andy now has 12 white socks.\n4. Calculate how many more white socks Andy still has than black socks. We subtract the number of black socks from the number of white socks:\n   \\[\n   12 - 6 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, Andy still has 6 more white socks than black socks.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many more white socks Andy has than black socks after losing half of his white socks, we start by finding out how many white socks he initially has. According to the problem, Andy has 4 times as many white socks as he has black socks. Since Andy has 6 black socks, we calculate the number of white socks as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of white socks} = 4 \\times \\text{Number of black socks} = 4 \\times 6 = 24\n\\]\n\nNext, Andy loses half of his white socks. Therefore, the number of white socks he loses is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{White socks lost} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n\\]\n\nAfter losing half of his white socks, the number of white socks Andy has left is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{White socks remaining} = 24 - 12 = 12\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more white socks Andy has than black socks. Since Andy has 12 white socks remaining and 6 black socks, we calculate the difference as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{White socks remaining} - \\text{Number of black socks} = 12 - 6 = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, Andy has \\(\\boxed{6}\\) more white socks than black socks.",

Find the difference between the remaining white socks and the black socks.\n\nFirst, we know Andy has 6 black socks. According to the problem, Andy has 4 times as many white socks as he has black socks. Therefore, we can calculate the number of white socks as follows:\n\\[\n4 \\times 6 = 24\n\\]\nSo, Andy initially has 24 white socks.\n\nNext, Andy loses half of his white socks. To find out how many white socks he has left, we calculate half of 24:\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{2} = 12\n\\]\nSo, Andy has 12 white socks left.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more white socks Andy has than black socks. Since he has 12 white socks and 6 black socks, we subtract the number of black socks from the number of white socks:\n\\[\n12 - 6 = 6\n\\]\nTherefore, Andy still has \\(\\boxed{6}\\) more white socks than black socks."
