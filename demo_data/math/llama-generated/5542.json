        "To determine how much less Yella's computer usage for this week is compared to last week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total computer usage for this week.\n2. Subtract the total computer usage for this week from the total computer usage for last week.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total computer usage for this week. Yella plans to use the computer 8 hours a day for 7 days. Therefore, we multiply 8 by 7:\n\\[ 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\]\nSo, Yella's computer usage for this week is 56 hours.\n\nNext, we subtract the total computer usage for this week from the total computer usage for last week. Last week, Yella used the computer for 91 hours. Therefore, we subtract 56 from 91:\n\\[ 91 - 56 = 35 \\]\nSo, Yella's computer usage for this week is 35 hours less than last week.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{35} \\]",

Therefore, we multiply 8 by 7:\n\n\\[ 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\]\n\nSo, Yella's computer usage for this week is 56 hours.\n\nNext, we subtract the total computer usage for this week from the total computer usage for last week. Last week, Yella used the computer for 91 hours. Therefore, we subtract 56 from 91:\n\n\\[ 91 - 56 = 35 \\]\n\nSo, Yella's computer usage for this week is 35 hours less than last week.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).",

        "To determine how much less Yella's computer usage will be for this week compared to last week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total computer usage for this week.\n2. Subtract the total computer usage for this week from the total computer usage for last week.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total computer usage for this week. Yella plans to use the computer 8 hours a day for 7 days. Therefore, we multiply 8 by 7:\n\n\\[ 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\]\n\nSo, Yella's computer usage for this week is 56 hours.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much less this is compared to last week's usage. Last week, Yella used the computer for 91 hours. We subtract this week's usage from last week's usage:\n\n\\[ 91 - 56 = 35 \\]\n\nTherefore, Yella's computer usage for this week is \\(\\boxed{35}\\) hours less than last week.",
