They took 20 channels away and replaced those with 12 channels.  He called the company and asked if he could reduce his package by 10 more channels but add the sports package which is 8 channels.  He realizes that he didn't add the supreme sports package.  He calls back and that package adds 7 more channels.  How many channels does Larry have?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
