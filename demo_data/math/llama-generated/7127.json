Convert the total hours into minutes.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of hours Celeste worked. Since Celeste worked twice as many hours as Bianca, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Hours Celeste worked} = 2 \\times 12.5 = 25 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of hours McClain worked.

Celeste worked twice as many hours as Bianca:\n\\[ \\text{Hours Celeste worked} = 2 \\times 12.5 = 25 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of hours McClain worked. McClain worked 8.5 hours less than Celeste:\n\\[ \\text{Hours McClain worked} = 25 - 8.5 = 16.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we add up the hours worked by Bianca, Celeste, and McClain:\n\\[ \\text{Total hours worked} = 12.5 + 25 + 16.5 = 54 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the total hours into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total hours by 60:\n\\[ \\text{Total minutes worked} = 54 \\times 60 = 3240 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of minutes worked by the three people is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3240} \\]"
