        "To determine how many peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Jackson ate for lunch this school year, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of Wednesdays and Fridays in the school year.\n2. Subtract the number of days Jackson missed.\n3. Add up the remaining Wednesdays and Fridays.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of Wednesdays and Fridays in the school year. Since there are 36 weeks of school, there are 36 Wednesdays and 36 Fridays.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of days Jackson missed. Jackson missed 1 Wednesday and 2 Fridays. So, we subtract 1 from the total number of Wednesdays and 2 from the total number of Fridays.\n\nThe number of Wednesdays Jackson ate is:\n\\[ 36 - 1 = 35 \\]\n\nThe number of Fridays Jackson ate is:\n\\[ 36 - 2 = 34 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of Wednesdays and Fridays Jackson ate to find the total number of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches he ate:\n\\[ 35 + 34 = 69 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Jackson ate for lunch this school year is \\(\\boxed{69}\\).",
