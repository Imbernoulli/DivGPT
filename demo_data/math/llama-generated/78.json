        "To determine how many questions Hannah has to get right to have the highest score in the class, we need to compare the scores of the two students she mentioned and then find out what score is higher.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the score of the student who got 95% on the exam. If the exam has 40 questions, then 95% of 40 is:\n\\[\n0.95 \\times 40 = 38\n\\]\nSo, this student got 38 questions right.\n\nNext, let's determine the score of the student who got 3 wrong out of 40. If this student got 3 wrong, then the number of questions he got right is:\n\\[\n40 - 3 = 37\n\\]\nSo, this student got 37 questions right.\n\nComparing the two scores, we see that 38 is higher than 37. Therefore, Hannah has to get at least 39 questions right to have the highest score in the class. If she gets 38 questions right, she will have the same score as the student who got 95%, and if she gets 37 questions right or less, she will have the lowest score in the class.\n\nThus, the number of questions Hannah has to get right to have the highest score in the class is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{39}\n\\]",

If the exam has 40 questions, then:\n\\[ 95\\% \\text{ of } 40 = 0.95 \\times 40 = 38 \\]\nSo, this student got 38 questions right.\n\nNext, let's calculate the score of the student who got 3 wrong out of 40.

Since there are 40 questions in total, the number of questions this student got right is:\n\\[ 40 - 3 = 37 \\]\nThis student's score is therefore:\n\\[ \\frac{37}{40} \\times 100 = 92.5\\% \\]\n\nNext, we compare this score to the score of the student who got a 95%. Since 95% is greater than 92.5%, Hannah needs to score higher than 95% to have the highest score in the class.\n\nTo find out how many questions Hannah has to get right to score higher than 95%, we set up the inequality:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{40} > 0.95 \\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of questions Hannah gets right.
