        "To determine how many cloves of garlic are needed to repel 30 vampires, 12 wights, and 40 vampire bats, we need to calculate the number of cloves required for each type of creature separately and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of cloves needed to repel the vampires:\n- 3 cloves of garlic repel 2 vampires.\n- Therefore, the number of cloves needed to repel 1 vampire is \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\) cloves.\n- To repel 30 vampires, the number of cloves needed is \\( 30 \\times 1.5 = 45 \\) cloves.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of cloves needed to repel the wights:\n- 3 cloves of garlic repel 3 wights.\n- Therefore, the number of cloves needed to repel 1 wight is \\( \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\) clove.\n- To repel 12 wights, the number of cloves needed is \\( 12 \\times 1 = 12 \\) cloves.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the number of cloves needed to repel the vampire bats:\n- 3 cloves of garlic repel 8 vampire bats.\n- Therefore, the number of cloves needed to repel 1 vampire bat is \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) cloves.\n- To repel 40 vampire bats, the number of cloves needed is \\( 40 \\times \\frac{3}{8} = 15 \\) cloves.\n\nNow, we sum the number of cloves needed for all the creatures:\n\\[ 45 + 12 + 15 = 72 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cloves of garlic needed is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).",
