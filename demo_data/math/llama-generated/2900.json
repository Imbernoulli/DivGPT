        "To determine how much money Geoffrey has left after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Geoffrey received from his family.\n2. Add this amount to the money he already had to find out how much money he had before going to the video game store.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the games from the total amount of money he had.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Geoffrey received from his family:\n\\[\n20 + 25 + 30 = 75 \\text{ euros}\n\\]\nLet's denote the amount of money Geoffrey already had as \\( x \\). According to the problem, after receiving the money from his family, he now has €125. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\nx + 75 = 125\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 75 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nx = 125 - 75 = 50 \\text{ euros}\n\\]\nSo, Geoffrey already had €50. Now, let's find out how much money he has after buying the games. The total cost of the games is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 35 = 105 \\text{ euros}\n\\]\nSubtracting the total cost of the games from the total amount of money he had:\n\\[\n125 - 105 = 20 \\text{ euros}\n\\]\nTherefore, after the purchase, Geoffrey has \\(\\boxed{20}\\) euros left.",
