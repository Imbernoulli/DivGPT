Add the number of palm trees in the desert to the number of palm trees in the forest.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of palm trees in the desert. The problem states that the desert has \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) fewer palm trees than the forest. The forest has 5000 palm trees. Therefore, the number of palm trees in the desert is:\n\\[\n5000 - \\left(\\frac{3}{5} \\times 5000\\right)\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\(\\frac{3}{5} \\times 5000\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 5000 = 3000\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of palm trees in the desert is:\n\\[\n5000 - 3000 = 2000\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of palm trees in the desert to the number of palm trees in the forest to find the total number of palm trees in both places:\n\\[\n5000 + 2000 = 7000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of palm trees in both the desert and the forest combined is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7000}\n\\]",
