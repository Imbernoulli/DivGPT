        "To determine how many chocolate and vanilla cupcakes Mary should make, we start by calculating the total number of cupcakes she still needs. Mary wants a total of 144 cupcakes and has already made 36 cherry cupcakes and 48 berry cupcakes. Therefore, the number of cupcakes she still needs is:\n\n\\[ 144 - 36 - 48 = 60 \\]\n\nMary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes. Since the total number of cupcakes she still needs is 60, which is an even number, she can divide this number equally between chocolate and vanilla cupcakes.

Therefore, the number of cupcakes she still needs is:\n\n\\[ 144 - 36 - 48 = 60 \\]\n\nMary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes. Let's denote the number of chocolate cupcakes she will make as \\( c \\) and the number of vanilla cupcakes she will make as \\( v \\). Since \\( c \\) and \\( v \\) are even numbers and their sum is 60, we can express this as:\n\n\\[ c + v = 60 \\]\n\nThere are many pairs of even numbers that satisfy this equation. However, since the problem does not specify any additional conditions to choose between the pairs, we can simply state one possible solution. A common and straightforward solution is to make an equal number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes. Therefore, we can set:\n\n\\[ c = v \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( c = v \\) into the equation \\( c + v = 60 \\), we get:\n\n\\[ c + c = 60 \\]\n\\[ 2c = 60 \\]\n\\[ c = 30 \\]\n\nSince \\( c = v \\), it follows that:\n\n\\[ v = 30 \\]\n\nThus, Mary should make \\(\\boxed{30}\\) chocolate cupcakes and \\(\\boxed{30}\\) vanilla cupcakes.",

        "To determine how many chocolate and vanilla cupcakes Mary should make, we first need to calculate how many cupcakes she still needs. Mary wants a total of 144 cupcakes and has already made 36 cherry cupcakes and 48 berry cupcakes. Therefore, the number of cupcakes she still needs is:\n\n\\[ 144 - 36 - 48 = 60 \\]\n\nMary wants to make an even number of chocolate and vanilla cupcakes. Since the total number of cupcakes she still needs is 60, which is an even number, she can split this number evenly between chocolate and vanilla cupcakes. Thus, she should make:\n\n\\[ \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\]\n\nSo, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes. The final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{30}\n\\]",

Since 60 is an even number, she can divide it equally between chocolate and vanilla cupcakes. Therefore, she should make:\n\n\\[ 60 \\div 2 = 30 \\]\n\nSo, Mary should make 30 chocolate cupcakes and 30 vanilla cupcakes. The final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{30}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many chocolate and vanilla cupcakes Mary should make, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes Mary has already made:**\n   - Cherry cupcakes: 36\n   - Berry cupcakes: 48\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cupcakes already made} = 36 + 48 = 84\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many more cupcakes Mary needs:**\n   - Total cupcakes required: 144\n   - Total cupcakes already made: 84\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining cupcakes needed} = 144 - 84 = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide the remaining cupcakes equally between chocolate and vanilla:**\n   - Since Mary wants to make an even number of each type of cupcake, we divide the remaining cupcakes by 2.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Chocolate cupcakes} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Vanilla cupcakes} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mary should make \\(\\boxed{30}\\) chocolate cupcakes and \\(\\boxed{30}\\) vanilla cupcakes."
