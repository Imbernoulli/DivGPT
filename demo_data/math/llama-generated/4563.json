        "To determine the length of the rope Tony has after tying all the ropes together, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total length of all the ropes before tying:**\n   - The 8-foot rope.\n   - The 20-foot rope.\n   - Three 2-foot ropes.\n   - The 7-foot rope.\n\n   Adding these lengths together:\n   \\[\n   8 + 20 + (3 \\times 2) + 7\n   \\]\n\n   First, calculate the total length of the three 2-foot ropes:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2 = 6\n   \\]\n\n   Now, add all the lengths together:\n   \\[\n   8 + 20 + 6 + 7 = 41\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of knots needed:**\n   - Tony is tying all the ropes together. Each rope will connect to another rope at one point, forming a knot. The number of knots required is one less than the number of ropes.\n   - Tony has 6 ropes (8-foot, 20-foot, 3 two-foot, and 7-foot).\n\n   Therefore, the number of knots is:\n   \\[\n   6 - 1 = 5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total length lost due to knots:**\n   - Each knot makes Tony lose 1.2 feet of rope.\n   - With 5 knots, the total length lost is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 1.2 = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the final length of the rope:**\n   - Subtract the total length lost from the total length of the ropes before tying:\n   \\[\n   41 - 6 = 35\n   \\]\n\nThus, the length of Tony's rope when he is done tying them all together is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{35}\n\\]",
