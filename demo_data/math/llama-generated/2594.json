        "To determine how many oranges Emily has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many oranges Sandra has.\n2. Use the number of Sandra's oranges to find out how many oranges Emily has.\n\nFirst, we know that Betty has 12 oranges. Sandra has 3 times as many oranges as Betty. Therefore, we can calculate the number of Sandra's oranges as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Sandra's oranges} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of Betty's oranges} = 3 \\times 12 = 36\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Emily has 7 times as many oranges as Sandra.
