Determine the remaining amount of money to be divided among the other 10 grandchildren.\n3. Divide the remaining amount by 10 to find out how much each of the remaining grandchildren received.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Grandma left $124,600 in her will and gave half of it to Shelby. Therefore, the amount Shelby received is:\n\\[\n\\frac{124,600}{2} = 62,300\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount Shelby received from the total amount of money to find out how much is left for the other 10 grandchildren:\n\\[\n124,600 - 62,300 = 62,300\n\\]\n\nNow, we divide the remaining amount by 10 to find out how much each of the remaining grandchildren received:\n\\[\n\\frac{62,300}{10} = 6,230\n\\]\n\nTherefore, each of the remaining 10 grandchildren received \\(\\boxed{6230}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine how much each of the remaining 10 grandchildren received, we start by calculating how much Shelby received. Shelby was given half of the $124,600.
