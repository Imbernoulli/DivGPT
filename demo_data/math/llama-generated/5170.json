Since Mark has 50% more points than Eric, we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Mark's points} = \\text{Eric's points} + 0.5 \\times \\text{Eric's points} = 6 + 0.5 \\times 6 = 6 + 3 = 9. \\]\nSo, Mark has 9 points.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many points Samanta has. Since Samanta has 8 more points than Mark, we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Samanta's points} = \\text{Mark's points} + 8 = 9 + 8 = 17. \\]\nSo, Samanta has 17 points.\n\nFinally, we add up the points of Samanta, Mark, and Eric:\n\\[ \\text{Total points} = \\text{Samanta's points} + \\text{Mark's points} + \\text{Eric's points} = 17 + 9 + 6 = 32. \\]\n\nTherefore, the total points Samanta, Mark, and Eric have is \\(\\boxed{32}\\).",
