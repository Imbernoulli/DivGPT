Therefore, 6 builders will be paid:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ builders} \\times 100 \\text{ dollars/builder} = 600 \\text{ dollars/day}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total cost to hire 6 builders for 450 days:**\n   The total cost is the product of the daily wage for 6 builders and the total number of days.\n   \\[\n   450 \\text{ days} \\times 600 \\text{ dollars/day} = 270,000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total cost to hire 6 builders to build 5 houses with 6 floors each is \\(\\boxed{270000}\\).",
