        "To determine the total number of tulips Arwen and Elrond picked, we start by identifying how many tulips each of them picked.\n\nFirst, we know that Arwen picked 20 tulips. This is given directly in the problem.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many tulips Elrond picked. The problem states that Elrond picked twice as many tulips as Arwen did. Therefore, we calculate the number of tulips Elrond picked by multiplying the number of tulips Arwen picked by 2:\n\\[\n2 \\times 20 = 40\n\\]\nSo, Elrond picked 40 tulips.\n\nNow, to find the total number of tulips picked by both Arwen and Elrond, we add the number of tulips Arwen picked to the number of tulips Elrond picked:\n\\[\n20 + 40 = 60\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of tulips they were able to get is \\boxed{60}.",
