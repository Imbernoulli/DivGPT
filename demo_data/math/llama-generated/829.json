We know that the standard poodle is 28 inches tall.\n2. The standard poodle is 8 inches taller than the miniature poodle. Therefore, we can find the height of the miniature poodle by subtracting 8 inches from the height of the standard poodle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height of the miniature poodle} = 28 - 8 = 20 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n3. The miniature poodle is 6 inches taller than the toy poodle. Therefore, we can find the height of the toy poodle by subtracting 6 inches from the height of the miniature poodle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height of the toy poodle} = 20 - 6 = 14 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the height of the toy poodle is \\(\\boxed{14}\\) inches."
