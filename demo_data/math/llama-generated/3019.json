        "To determine the total number of coins that four bank tellers have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of coins each bank teller has.\n2. Multiply the number of coins each bank teller has by the number of bank tellers.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of coins each bank teller has. Each bank teller has 10 rolls of coins, and each roll has 25 coins. Therefore, the number of coins each bank teller has is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ rolls} \\times 25 \\text{ coins per roll} = 250 \\text{ coins} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many coins four bank tellers have in total. Since each bank teller has 250 coins, the total number of coins for four bank tellers is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ tellers} \\times 250 \\text{ coins per teller} = 1000 \\text{ coins} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of coins that four bank tellers have is \\(\\boxed{1000}\\).",

Therefore, the number of coins each bank teller has is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ rolls} \\times 25 \\text{ coins per roll} = 250 \\text{ coins} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many coins four bank tellers have in total. Since each bank teller has 250 coins, the total number of coins four bank tellers have is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ tellers} \\times 250 \\text{ coins per teller} = 1000 \\text{ coins} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of coins that four bank tellers have is \\(\\boxed{1000}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of coins four bank tellers have, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coins per bank teller:**\n   Each bank teller has 10 rolls of coins, and each roll contains 25 coins.
