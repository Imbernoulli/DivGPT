        "Let's start by determining the current ages of the three siblings. The eldest child is 20 years old. Since each sibling is born 5 years apart, the middle child is 20 - 5 = 15 years old, and the youngest child is 15 - 5 = 10 years old.\n\nNext, we need to find out how old each sibling will be 10 years from now. The eldest child will be 20 + 10 = 30 years old, the middle child will be 15 + 10 = 25 years old, and the youngest child will be 10 + 10 = 20 years old.\n\nTo find the total of their ages 10 years from now, we add their ages together:\n30 + 25 + 20 = 75\n\nTherefore, the total of the ages of the three siblings 10 years from now is \\boxed{75}.",

        "Let's start by determining the current ages of the three siblings. We know that the eldest child is 20 years old. Since each sibling is born 5 years apart, the middle child is 5 years younger than the eldest child, and the youngest child is 10 years younger than the eldest child. Therefore, the current ages of the siblings are:\n\n- Eldest child: 20 years old\n- Middle child: \\(20 - 5 = 15\\) years old\n- Youngest child: \\(20 - 10 = 10\\) years old\n\nNext, we need to find out the ages of the siblings 10 years from now. We do this by adding 10 years to each of their current ages:\n\n- Eldest child: \\(20 + 10 = 30\\) years old\n- Middle child: \\(15 + 10 = 25\\) years old\n- Youngest child: \\(10 + 10 = 20\\) years old\n\nNow, we sum the ages of the siblings 10 years from now:\n\n\\[\n30 + 25 + 20 = 75\n\\]\n\nThus, the total of the ages of the three siblings 10 years from now is \\(\\boxed{75}\\).",
