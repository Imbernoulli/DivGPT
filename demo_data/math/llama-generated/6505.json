        "To determine the total number of boxes of milk Lolita drinks per week, we need to break down her milk consumption on a daily basis and then sum it up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate her milk consumption during the weekdays. Lolita drinks 3 boxes of milk each weekday. Since there are 5 weekdays (Monday through Friday), her total milk consumption for the weekdays is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ boxes/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 15 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate her milk consumption on Saturday. On Saturday, she drinks twice the number of boxes of milk than on a weekday. Since she drinks 3 boxes of milk on a weekday, her milk consumption on Saturday is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 3 \\text{ boxes} = 6 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate her milk consumption on Sunday. On Sunday, she drinks thrice the number of boxes of milk than on a weekday. Since she drinks 3 boxes of milk on a weekday, her milk consumption on Sunday is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 \\text{ boxes} = 9 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nNow, we sum up her milk consumption for the entire week:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ boxes} \\text{ (weekdays)} + 6 \\text{ boxes} \\text{ (Saturday)} + 9 \\text{ boxes} \\text{ (Sunday)} = 30 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of boxes of milk Lolita drinks per week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",
