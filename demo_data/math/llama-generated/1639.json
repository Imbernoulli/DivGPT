        "To determine the total cost of the concert tickets Jenna's friends pay, we need to calculate the cost of each ticket and then sum these costs. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of the two tickets from the concert website:**\n   Each ticket costs $50.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 50 = 100\n   \\]\n   So, the cost for these two tickets is $100.\n\n2. **Calculate the cost of the two tickets from the scalper:**\n   The scalper offers the tickets for 240% of the normal price. First, we need to find 240% of $50.\n   \\[\n   240\\% = 2.40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2.40 \\times 50 = 120\n   \\]\n   So, the cost for each ticket from the scalper is $120. Since Jenna convinces the scalper to give her $10 off the total payment for these two tickets, we first calculate the total cost without the discount.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 120 = 240\n   \\]\n   Then, we subtract the $10 discount.\n   \\[\n   240 - 10 = 230\n   \\]\n   So, the cost for these two tickets is $230.\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the one discounted ticket:**\n   One friend gets a discounted ticket through her job for 60% of the normal price. First, we need to find 60% of $50.\n   \\[\n   60\\% = 0.60\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0.60 \\times 50 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, the cost for this ticket is $30.\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of all the tickets:**\n   Now, we add the costs of all the tickets together.\n   \\[\n   100 + 230 + 30 = 360\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount Jenna's friends pay for their tickets is \\(\\boxed{360}\\).",

The cost of the two tickets from the concert website is $100, the cost of the two tickets from the scalper after the discount is $230, and the cost of the one discounted ticket is $30. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[\n100 + 230 + 30 = 360\n\\]\nSo, the total amount Jenna's friends pay for their tickets is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{360}\n\\]",

        "To determine the total cost of the concert tickets Jenna's friends pay, we need to calculate the cost of each ticket and then sum these costs. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of the first two tickets:**\n   Jenna gets two tickets from the concert website for $50 each.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 50 = 100\n   \\]\n   So, the cost for the first two tickets is $100.\n\n2. **Cost of the next two tickets:**\n   A scalper offers to sell her two more tickets for 240% of the normal price. The normal price of a ticket is $50, so 240% of $50 is:\n   \\[\n   240\\% \\times 50 = 2.4 \\times 50 = 120\n   \\]\n   The cost for two tickets at this price is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 120 = 240\n   \\]\n   Jenna convinces the scalper to give her $10 off that total payment:\n   \\[\n   240 - 10 = 230\n   \\]\n   So, the cost for the next two tickets is $230.\n\n3. **Cost of the last ticket:**\n   One of her friends gets a discounted ticket through her job for 60% of the normal price. The normal price of a ticket is $50, so 60% of $50 is:\n   \\[\n   60\\% \\times 50 = 0.6 \\times 50 = 30\n   \\]\n   So, the cost for the last ticket is $30.\n\n4. **Total cost of all five tickets:**\n   We add the costs of the first two tickets, the next two tickets, and the last ticket:\n   \\[\n   100 + 230 + 30 = 360\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the concert tickets Jenna's friends pay is \\(\\boxed{360}\\).",
