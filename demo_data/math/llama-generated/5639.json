Reyna has 20 lamps, and each lamp has 7 light bulbs:\n\\[\n20 \\times 7 = 140\n\\]\nSo, there are 140 light bulbs in total.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many light bulbs are burnt out. We know that \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the lamps have 2 burnt-out light bulbs each. First, we find out how many lamps have burnt-out light bulbs:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 = 5\n\\]\nSo, 5 lamps have burnt-out light bulbs. Since each of these 5 lamps has 2 burnt-out light bulbs, the total number of burnt-out light bulbs is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 2 = 10\n\\]\nNow, we subtract the number of burnt-out light bulbs from the total number of light bulbs to find the number of working light bulbs:\n\\[\n140 - 10 = 130\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of working light bulbs is \\(\\boxed{130}\\).",
