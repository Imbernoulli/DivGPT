        "To determine how many desserts Sarah ends up with, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how many cupcakes Sarah gives to Michael.\n2. Subtract the number of cupcakes given to Michael from the total number of cupcakes Sarah initially had.\n3. Add the number of cookies Michael gives to Sarah to the remaining number of cupcakes.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many cupcakes Sarah gives to Michael. Sarah initially has 9 cupcakes and she saves a third of them to give to Michael:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{3} = 3\n\\]\nSo, Sarah gives 3 cupcakes to Michael.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of cupcakes given to Michael from the total number of cupcakes Sarah initially had:\n\\[\n9 - 3 = 6\n\\]\nSo, after giving 3 cupcakes to Michael, Sarah has 6 cupcakes left.\n\nNow, we add the number of cookies Michael gives to Sarah to the remaining number of cupcakes. Michael gives Sarah 5 cookies:\n\\[\n6 + 5 = 11\n\\]\nSo, after receiving 5 cookies from Michael, Sarah has 11 desserts.\n\nTherefore, the total number of desserts Sarah ends up with is \\boxed{11}.",
        "To determine how many desserts Sarah ends up with, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of cookies Sarah receives from Michael:**\n   Michael saved 5 cookies to give to Sarah.

Add the number of cookies Michael gives to Sarah to the remaining number of cupcakes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many cupcakes Sarah gives to Michael. Sarah down a third of her 9 cupcakes:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 9 = 3\n\\]\nSo, Sarah gives 3 cupcakes to Michael.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of cupcakes Sarah gives to Michael from her original number of cupcakes:\n\\[\n9 - 3 = 6\n\\]\nSo, after giving 3 cupcakes to Michael, Sarah has 6 cupcakes left.\n\nThen, we add the number of cookies Michael gives to Sarah to the remaining number of cupcakes. Michael gives Sarah 5 cookies:\n\\[\n6 + 5 = 11\n\\]\nSo, after receiving 5 cookies from Michael, Sarah has 11 desserts.\n\nTherefore, the number of desserts Sarah ends up with is \\boxed{11}.",
        "Let's start by determining how many cupcakes Sarah gives to Michael. Sarah initially has 9 cupcakes and she saves a third of them to give to Michael.

So, we add these 5 cookies to the 6 cupcakes Sarah has left:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total desserts with Sarah} = 6 + 5 = 11\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of desserts Sarah ends up with is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]",

Sarah initially has 9 cupcakes and she saves a third of them to give to Michael:\n\\[\n\\text{Cupcakes given to Michael} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 9 = 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of cupcakes given to Michael from the total number of cupcakes Sarah initially has:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining cupcakes} = 9 - 3 = 6\n\\]\n\nThen, we add the number of cookies Michael gives to Sarah to the remaining number of cupcakes Sarah has. Michael gives Sarah 5 cookies:\n\\[\n\\text{Total desserts Sarah ends up with} = 6 + 5 = 11\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of desserts Sarah ends up with is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
