        "To determine how much money Joe has left after his purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the notebooks and the books he bought, and then subtract that total from the $56 his mother gave him.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks. Joe bought 7 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4. So, the total cost of the notebooks is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ notebooks} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars per notebook} = 28 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the books. Joe bought 2 books, and each book costs $7. So, the total cost of the books is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ books} \\times 7 \\text{ dollars per book} = 14 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the books to find the total amount of money Joe spent:\n\\[ 28 \\text{ dollars} + 14 \\text{ dollars} = 42 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount spent from the $56 Joe's mother gave him to find out how much money Joe has left:\n\\[ 56 \\text{ dollars} - 42 \\text{ dollars} = 14 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Joe has left is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
