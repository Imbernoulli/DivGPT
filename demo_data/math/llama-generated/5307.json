We know that one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. Therefore, we multiply the number of red jelly beans by one quarter:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of coconut flavored jelly beans} = 3000 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 3000 \\times 0.25 = 750\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of coconut flavored jelly beans is \\boxed{750}.",
