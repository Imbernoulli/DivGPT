        "To determine how long Buffy held her breath underwater, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert Kelly's breath-holding time from minutes to seconds.\n2. Calculate Brittany's breath-holding time in seconds.\n3. Calculate Buffy's breath-holding time in seconds.\n\nFirst, we convert Kelly's breath-holding time from minutes to seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we have:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ minutes} = 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate Brittany's breath-holding time. Brittany held her breath for 20 seconds less than Kelly. Therefore, we subtract 20 seconds from Kelly's breath-holding time:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ seconds} - 20 \\text{ seconds} = 160 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate Buffy's breath-holding time. Buffy held her breath for 40 seconds less than Brittany. Therefore, we subtract 40 seconds from Brittany's breath-holding time:\n\\[ 160 \\text{ seconds} - 40 \\text{ seconds} = 120 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nThus, Buffy held her breath underwater for \\(\\boxed{120}\\) seconds.",
