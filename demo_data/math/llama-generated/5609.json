        "To determine how much Silvia will save by buying the guitar from the cheaper store, we need to calculate the total cost of the guitar from each store and then find the difference between these two costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the guitar from Guitar Center:\n1. The suggested retail price of the guitar is $1000.\n2. Guitar Center offers a 15% discount. So, we need to find 15% of $1000:\n   \\[\n   0.15 \\times 1000 = 150\n   \\]\n3. Subtract the discount from the suggested retail price to get the discounted price:\n   \\[\n   1000 - 150 = 850\n   \\]\n4. Add the shipping fee of $100 to the discounted price:\n   \\[\n   850 + 100 = 950\n   \\]\nSo, the total cost of the guitar from Guitar Center is $950.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the guitar from Sweetwater:\n1. The suggested retail price of the guitar is $1000.\n2. Sweetwater offers a 10% discount. So, we need to find 10% of $1000:\n   \\[\n   0.10 \\times 1000 = 100\n   \\]\n3. Subtract the discount from the suggested retail price to get the discounted price:\n   \\[\n   1000 - 100 = 900\n   \\]\n4. Since Sweetwater offers free shipping, we do not add any shipping fee. So, the total cost of the guitar from Sweetwater is $900.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the total cost from Guitar Center and the total cost from Sweetwater to determine how much Silvia will save by buying from the cheaper store:\n\\[\n950 - 900 = 50\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Silvia will save \\(\\boxed{50}\\) dollars by buying the guitar from Sweetwater compared to Guitar Center.",
