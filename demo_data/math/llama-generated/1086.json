Determine the total age of all 10 students by adding the age of the tenth student.\n3. Calculate the new average age of the 10 students.\n4. Find the difference between the new average and the original average.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The average age of the 9 students is 8 years. Therefore, the total age of these 9 students is:\n\\[ 9 \\times 8 = 72 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nNext, we add the age of the tenth student, who is 28 years old, to the total age of the 9 students:\n\\[ 72 + 28 = 100 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the new average age of the 10 students by dividing the total age by 10:\n\\[ \\frac{100}{10} = 10 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nThe original average age of the 9 students was 8 years. The new average age of the 10 students is 10 years. The increase in the average age is:\n\\[ 10 - 8 = 2 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nTherefore, the average age will increase by \\(\\boxed{2}\\) years.",
        "To determine how many years the average age of the class will increase when the tenth student is added, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total age of the 9 students:**\n   The average age of the 9 students is 8 years. Therefore, the total age of these 9 students is:\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 8 = 72 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total age of all 10 students:**\n   The tenth student is 28 years old. Therefore, the total age of all 10 students is:\n   \\[\n   72 + 28 = 100 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the new average age of the 10 students:**\n   The new average age is the total age of the 10 students divided by 10:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{100}{10} = 10 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the increase in the average age:**\n   The original average age was 8 years, and the new average age is 10 years. Therefore, the increase in the average age is:\n   \\[\n   10 - 8 = 2 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the average age will increase by \\(\\boxed{2}\\) years.",
