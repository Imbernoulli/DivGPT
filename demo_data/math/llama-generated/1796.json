Identify the amount Sabina needs to apply for in a loan.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The total tuition is $30,000 and Sabina has saved $10,000. So, the remaining tuition is:\n   \\[\n   30,000 - 10,000 = 20,000\n   \\]\n\n2. Sabina was awarded a grant that will cover 40% of the remaining tuition. So, the amount covered by the grant is:\n   \\[\n   0.40 \\times 20,000 = 8,000\n   \\]\n\n3. After the grant is applied, the remaining amount needed is:\n   \\[\n   20,000 - 8,000 = 12,000\n   \\]\n\n4. Therefore, Sabina needs to apply for a loan that will cover the remaining $12,000.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12000}\n\\]",
