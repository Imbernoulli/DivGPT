        "To determine the total number of spots on Ruth's cow, we need to calculate the number of spots on the right side and then add it to the number of spots on the left side.\n\nFirst, we know that the cow has 16 spots on its left side. Let's denote the number of spots on the left side as \\( L \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ L = 16 \\]\n\nNext, we are given that the number of spots on the right side is three times the number of spots on the left side plus 7. Let's denote the number of spots on the right side as \\( R \\). Therefore, we can express \\( R \\) as:\n\\[ R = 3L + 7 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( L \\) into the equation for \\( R \\), we get:\n\\[ R = 3(16) + 7 \\]\n\\[ R = 48 + 7 \\]\n\\[ R = 55 \\]\n\nNow, to find the total number of spots on the cow, we add the number of spots on the left side to the number of spots on the right side:\n\\[ \\text{Total spots} = L + R \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total spots} = 16 + 55 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total spots} = 71 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of spots on the cow is \\(\\boxed{71}\\).",
