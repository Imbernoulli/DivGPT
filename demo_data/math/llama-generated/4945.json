        "To determine how much money Mia has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how much money Darwin has.\n2. Calculate twice the amount of money Darwin has.\n3. Add $20 to the result from step 2.\n\nLet's go through these steps in detail:\n\n1. Darwin has $45.\n2. Twice the amount of money Darwin has is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 45 = 90\n   \\]\n3. Mia has $20 more than this amount, so we add $20 to $90:\n   \\[\n   90 + 20 = 110\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mia has \\(\\boxed{110}\\) dollars.",
