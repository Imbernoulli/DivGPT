        "First, we need to determine the有效的 discount on the second pair of shoes. According to the offer, the second pair of shoes is half off the original price, but this discount applies only to the cheaper pair of shoes. The first pair of shoes costs $40 and the second pair costs $60, so the cheaper pair is the first pair. Therefore, the discount on the first pair of shoes is:\n\\[\n\\frac{40}{2} = 20\n\\]\nAfter applying the discount, the price of the first pair of shoes is:\n\\[\n40 - 20 = 20\n\\]\nThe price of the second pair of shoes remains $60. So, the total cost of the two pairs of shoes before the extra discount is:\n\\[\n20 + 60 = 80\n\\]\nJames was selected for an extra discount of a fourth off the total amount. To find the amount of this extra discount, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{80}{4} = 20\n\\]\nAfter applying the extra discount, the total amount James pays is:\n\\[\n80 - 20 = 60\n\\]\nTherefore, the amount of money James ended up paying for both pairs of shoes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{60}\n\\]",
