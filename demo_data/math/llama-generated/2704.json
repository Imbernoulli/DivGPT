        "To determine the sum of the ages of Alex and Allison now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Diane's age when she turns 30.\n2. Determine Alex's age when Diane turns 30.\n3. Determine Allison's age when Diane turns 30.\n4. Use Diane's current age to find Alex's and Allison's current ages.\n5. Sum Alex's and Allison's current ages.\n\nFirst, we know that Diane is currently 16 years old. When she turns 30, she will be \\(30 - 16 = 14\\) years older than she is now. Therefore, Diane's age when she turns 30 will be 30.\n\nNext, we know that when Diane turns 30, she will be half the age of Alex. So, Alex's age when Diane turns 30 will be:\n\\[ 30 \\times 2 = 60 \\]\n\nWe also know that when Diane turns 30, she will be twice as old as Allison. So, Allison's age when Diane turns 30 will be:\n\\[ \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\]\n\nSince Diane will be 30 years old in 14 years, Alex's current age is:\n\\[ 60 - 14 = 46 \\]\n\nSimilarly, Allison's current age is:\n\\[ 15 - 14 = 1 \\]\n\nThe sum of Alex's and Allison's current ages is:\n\\[ 46 + 1 = 47 \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the ages of Alex and Allison now is:\n\\[ \\boxed{47} \\]",
        "To determine the sum of the ages of Alex and Allison now, we start by finding out how old each person will be when Diane turns 30. Since Diane is currently 16 years old, she will turn 30 in \\(30 - 16 = 14\\) years.\n\nNext, we use the information given about Diane's age when she turns 30:\n1. Diane will be half the age of Alex.\n2. Diane will be twice as old as Allison.\n\nFirst, we calculate Alex's age when Diane turns 30. Since Diane will be 30 years old and she will be half the age of Alex, Alex will be:\n\\[30 \\times 2 = 60\\] years old.\n\nNow, we calculate Allison's age when Diane turns 30. Since Diane will be 30 years old and she will be twice as old as Allison, Allison will be:\n\\[30 \\div 2 = 15\\] years old.\n\nTo find the current ages of Alex and Allison, we subtract the 14 years from their ages when Diane turns 30:\n- Alex's current age is \\(60 - 14 = 46\\).\n- Allison's current age is \\(15 - 14 = 1\\).\n\nFinally, we find the sum of the current ages of Alex and Allison:\n\\[46 + 1 = 47\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the ages of Alex and Allison now is \\(\\boxed{47}\\).",

According to the problem, when Diane is 30, she will be half the age of Alex and twice as old as Allison. Let's denote Alex's current age as \\( A \\) and Allison's current age as \\( L \\).\n\nFirst, we express Alex's age in 14 years in terms of his current age:\n\n\\[ A + 14 \\]\n\nSince Diane will be half the age of Alex in 14 years, we can write:\n\n\\[ 30 = \\frac{1}{2} (A + 14) \\]\n\nTo find \\( A \\), we solve the equation:\n\n\\[ 30 = \\frac{1}{2} (A + 14) \\]\n\\[ 30 \\times 2 = A + 14 \\]\n\\[ 60 = A + 14 \\]\n\\[ A = 60 - 14 \\]\n\\[ A = 46 \\]\n\nNext, we express Allison's age in 14 years in terms of her current age:\n\n\\[ L + 14 \\]\n\nSince Diane will be twice as old as Allison in 14 years, we can write:\n\n\\[ 30 = 2 (L + 14) \\]\n\nTo find \\( L \\), we solve the equation:\n\n\\[ 30 = 2 (L + 14) \\]\n\\[ 30 \\div 2 = L + 14 \\]\n\\[ 15 = L + 14 \\]\n\\[ L = 15 - 14 \\]\n\\[ L = 1 \\]\n\nNow, we have Alex's current age as 46 and Allison's current age as 1.
