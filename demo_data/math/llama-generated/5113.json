        "To determine the price of the tennis racket, we need to start by identifying the total amount John spent and the costs of the other items he purchased. According to the problem, John spent a total of $750 on the tennis racket, sneakers, and a sports outfit. The sneakers cost $200 and the sports outfit cost $250. We can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of the racket} + \\text{Cost of the sneakers} + \\text{Cost of the sports outfit} = \\text{Total cost}\n\\]\n\nLet's denote the cost of the tennis racket by \\( x \\). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nx + 200 + 250 = 750\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine the costs of the sneakers and the sports outfit:\n\n\\[\nx + 450 = 750\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 450 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = 750 - 450\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\n\\[\nx = 300\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the price of the tennis racket is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",

        "To determine the price of the tennis racket, we start by identifying the total amount John spent and the costs of the other items he purchased. The total amount spent is $750, the cost of the sneakers is $200, and the cost of the sports outfit is $250. Let's denote the price of the tennis racket as \\( x \\).\n\nThe equation that represents the total expenditure is:\n\\[\nx + 200 + 250 = 750\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine the costs of the sneakers and the sports outfit:\n\\[\nx + 450 = 750\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we need to isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 450 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nx = 750 - 450\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\nx = 300\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the price of the tennis racket is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
        "To find the price of the tennis racket, we start by defining the cost of the racket as \\( x \\). According to the problem, John spent a total of $750 on the tennis racket, sneakers, and sports outfit. The cost of the sneakers is $200 and the cost of the sports outfit is $250. Therefore, we can write the following equation to represent the total cost:\n\n\\[ x + 200 + 250 = 750 \\]\n\nNext, we combine the costs of the sneakers and the sports outfit:\n\n\\[ x + 450 = 750 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( x \\), we subtract 450 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ x = 750 - 450 \\]\n\\[ x = 300 \\]\n\nSo, the price of the tennis racket is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",
