        "To determine the total number of pages Sarah will copy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of copies needed for each person.\n2. Calculate the total number of copies needed for all the people.\n3. Multiply the total number of copies by the number of pages in each contract.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of copies needed for each person.\nEach person needs 2 copies of the contract.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of copies needed for all the people.\nThere are 9 people, and each person needs 2 copies. Therefore, the total number of copies is:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ people} \\times 2 \\text{ copies per person} = 18 \\text{ copies} \\]\n\nStep 3: Multiply the total number of copies by the number of pages in each contract.\nEach contract is 20 pages long.
