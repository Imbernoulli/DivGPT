        "Let's denote the number of oranges Martin has now as \\( O \\) and the number of limes Martin has now as \\( L \\). According to the problem, Martin has 50 oranges, so we have:\n\\[ O = 50 \\]\n\nThe problem also states that Martin remained with twice as many oranges as limes after eating half of the fruits he initially had. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ O = 2L \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( O \\) into this equation, we get:\n\\[ 50 = 2L \\]\nSolving for \\( L \\), we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[ L = 25 \\]\n\nNow, we know that Martin has 50 oranges and 25 limes. The total number of fruits he has now is:\n\\[ O + L = 50 + 25 = 75 \\]\n\nSince Martin ate half of the fruits he initially had, the number of fruits he initially had is twice the number of fruits he has now:\n\\[ \\text{Initial number of fruits} = 2 \\times 75 = 150 \\]\n\nThus, the initial number of fruits Martin had is:\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]",

According to the problem, after eating half of the fruits, Martin remained with twice as many oranges as limes. This means that after eating half of the fruits, he has \\( \\frac{O}{2} \\) oranges and \\( \\frac{L}{2} \\) limes.\n\nWe are given that after eating, Martin has 50 oranges. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[\n\\frac{O}{2} = 50\n\\]\nTo find \\( O \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\nO = 100\n\\]\nSo, Martin initially had 100 oranges. According to the problem, after eating half of the fruits, he has twice as many oranges as limes. This gives us the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{O}{2} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{L}{2}\n\\]\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{O}{2} = L\n\\]\nWe already know that \\( \\frac{O}{2} = 50 \\), so we can substitute 50 for \\( \\frac{O}{2} \\) in the equation:\n\\[\n50 = L\n\\]\nSo, Martin initially had 50 limes. The total number of fruits Martin initially had is the sum of the initial number of oranges and limes:\n\\[\nO + L = 100 + 50 = 150\n\\]\nTherefore, the initial number of fruits Martin had is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{150}\n\\]",
        "Let's denote the number of limes Martin has now as \\( L \\). According to the problem, Martin has 50 oranges and twice as many oranges as limes. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of oranges as:\n\\[ 50 = 2L \\]\n\nTo find the number of limes, we solve for \\( L \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ L = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\]\n\nSo, Martin now has 50 oranges and 25 limes. The total number of fruits he has now is:\n\\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \\]\n\nThe problem states that Martin ate half of the number of fruits he had initially, so the number of fruits he has now (75) is half of the number of fruits he had originally.
