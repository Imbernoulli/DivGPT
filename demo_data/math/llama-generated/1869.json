        "To determine the height of the tree in Kilmer Park after 8 years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total growth over 8 years:**\n   The tree grows 5 feet each year. Over 8 years, the total growth can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ feet/year} \\times 8 \\text{ years} = 40 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the total growth to the initial height:**\n   The initial height of the tree is 52 feet. Adding the total growth over 8 years:\n   \\[\n   52 \\text{ feet} + 40 \\text{ feet} = 92 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the height from feet to inches:**\n   There are 12 inches in 1 foot. To convert 92 feet to inches:\n   \\[\n   92 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 1104 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the tree in 8 years will be \\(\\boxed{1104}\\) inches.",
