Since each shelter services 30 people, we multiply the number of shelters by the number of people per shelter:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ shelters} \\times 30 \\text{ people per shelter} = 180 \\text{ people}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of cans of soup needed. Since Mark decides to buy 10 cans of soup per person, we multiply the total number of people served by the number of cans per person:\n\\[\n180 \\text{ people} \\times 10 \\text{ cans per person} = 1800 \\text{ cans}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cans of soup Mark donates is \\(\\boxed{1800}\\).",
