        "To determine the mass of apples that Ali has left after selling some, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total mass of apples initially on the shelves.\n2. Subtract the mass of apples sold from the total mass initially on the shelves.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total mass of apples initially on the shelves. Ali has three types of apples: kidney apples, golden apples, and Canada apples. The mass of each type is given as follows:\n- Kidney apples: 23 kg\n- Golden apples: 37 kg\n- Canada apples: 14 kg\n\nAdding these together, we get:\n\\[ 23 + 37 + 14 = 74 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nSo, the total mass of apples initially on the shelves is 74 kg.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the mass of apples sold from the total mass initially on the shelves. According to the problem, 36 kg of apples were sold. Therefore, we subtract 36 kg from 74 kg:\n\\[ 74 - 36 = 38 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nThus, the mass of apples that Ali has left is \\(\\boxed{38}\\) kg.",
        "To find out how many kilograms of apples Ali has left after selling some, we first need to determine the total mass of apples initially on the shelves. Ali has three different types of apples: kidney apples, golden apples, and Canada apples. The masses of these apples are 23 kg, 37 kg, and 14 kg respectively.\n\nWe start by adding these masses together:\n\\[ 23 + 37 + 14 = 74 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nThis means that initially, Ali had 74 kg of apples on the shelves. By noon, 36 kg of apples were sold. To find out how many kilograms of apples are left, we subtract the mass of apples sold from the initial mass:\n\\[ 74 - 36 = 38 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nTherefore, the mass of apples that Ali has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{38} \\]",
