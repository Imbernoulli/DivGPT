        "To determine how many hours Melissa has to work, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how many dresses Melissa can make with 56 square meters of fabric.\n2. Determine the total number of hours required to make those dresses.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many dresses Melissa can make. Since each dress requires 4 square meters of fabric, we divide the total amount of fabric by the fabric needed per dress:\n\\[\n\\frac{56 \\text{ square meters}}{4 \\text{ square meters per dress}} = 14 \\text{ dresses}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of hours required to make 14 dresses. Since each dress takes 3 hours to make, we multiply the number of dresses by the hours per dress:\n\\[\n14 \\text{ dresses} \\times 3 \\text{ hours per dress} = 42 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Melissa has to work \\boxed{42} hours.",
