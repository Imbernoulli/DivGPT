        "To determine the total weight the canoe was carrying, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of people the canoe can carry with the dog inside.\n2. Determine the weight of each person and the weight of the dog.\n3. Calculate the total weight of the people and the dog.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of people the canoe can carry with the dog inside.**\n\nThe canoe can carry 6 people, but with the dog inside, it can only carry \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of that number.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of people with the dog inside} = 6 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the weight of each person and the weight of the dog.**\n\nEach person weighs 140 pounds, and the dog weighs \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) as much as a person.\n\\[\n\\text{Weight of the dog} = 140 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 35 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the people and the dog.**\n\nThe total weight of the people is the number of people multiplied by the weight of each person.\n\\[\n\\text{Total weight of the people} = 4 \\times 140 = 560 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nAdding the weight of the dog to the total weight of the people gives us the total weight the canoe was carrying.\n\\[\n\\text{Total weight the canoe was carrying} = 560 + 35 = 595 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total weight the canoe was carrying is \\(\\boxed{595}\\).",
        "First, we determine the maximum number of people Penny's canoe can carry when she has her dog inside. The canoe's original capacity is 6 people, but with the dog, it can only carry \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of that number. So, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 = 4\n\\]\n\nThis means Penny's canoe can carry 4 people when she has her dog inside. Since Penny herself is one of these people, the number of additional people she can carry is:\n\n\\[\n4 - 1 = 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the weight of each person and the dog. Each person weighs 140 pounds, and the dog weighs \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) as much as a person. So, the weight of the dog is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 140 = 35 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total weight of the people and the dog. The weight of the 3 additional people is:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 140 = 420 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nAdding the weight of Penny (140 pounds) and the dog (35 pounds) to the weight of the 3 additional people, the total weight the canoe is carrying is:\n\n\\[\n140 + 420 + 35 = 595 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total weight the canoe was carrying is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{595}\n\\]",
