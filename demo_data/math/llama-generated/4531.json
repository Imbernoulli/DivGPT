        "To determine how much money the store has left after the sale, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the discounted price of each item:**\n   The original price of each item is $50. With an 80% discount, the discount amount per item is:\n   \\[\n   0.80 \\times 50 = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the discounted price per item is:\n   \\[\n   50 - 40 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of items sold:**\n   The store sells 90% of its 2000 items. The number of items sold is:\n   \\[\n   0.90 \\times 2000 = 1800 \\text{ items}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total revenue from the sale:**\n   The total revenue from selling 1800 items at $10 each is:\n   \\[\n   1800 \\times 10 = 18000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the amount owed to creditors:**\n   The store owed $15000 to its creditors.
