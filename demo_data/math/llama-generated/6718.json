        "To determine how many hours a day Randy needs to practice to become a piano expert before he is 20, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of years Randy will practice:**\n   Randy wants to become an expert before he is 20. Since he just turned 12, he has:\n   \\[\n   20 - 12 = 8 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of days Randy practices each year:**\n   Randy practices Monday through Friday, which is 5 days a week. He takes two weeks off for vacation each year. Therefore, he practices for:\n   \\[\n   52 \\text{ weeks} - 2 \\text{ weeks} = 50 \\text{ weeks per year}\n   \\]\n   The total number of days he practices each year is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ weeks} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 250 \\text{ days per year}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of days Randy will practice over 8 years:**\n   \\[\n   250 \\text{ days/year} \\times 8 \\text{ years} = 2000 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of hours Randy needs to practice each day:**\n   To become an expert, Randy needs to practice a total of 10,000 hours. Therefore, the number of hours he needs to practice each day is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10000 \\text{ hours}}{2000 \\text{ days}} = 5 \\text{ hours/day}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Randy needs to practice \\(\\boxed{5}\\) hours a day to become a piano expert before he is 20.",
        "To determine how many hours a day Randy needs to practice to become a piano expert before he is 20, we need to calculate the total number of days he will practice over the next 8 years (from age 12 to age 20) and then divide the total number of practice hours required (10,000 hours) by the number of days.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of days Randy will practice each year. Since he practices Monday through Friday, he practices 5 days a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, but he takes two weeks off for vacation, so he practices for \\(52 - 2 = 50\\) weeks each year. Therefore, the number of days he practices each year is:\n\\[50 \\text{ weeks/year} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 250 \\text{ days/year}\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of days Randy will practice over the 8 years:\n\\[250 \\text{ days/year} \\times 8 \\text{ years} = 2000 \\text{ days}\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many hours a day Randy needs to practice. We do this by dividing the total number of practice hours required by the total number of days:\n\\[\\frac{10000 \\text{ hours}}{2000 \\text{ days}} = 5 \\text{ hours/day}\\]\n\nTherefore, Randy needs to practice \\(\\boxed{5}\\) hours a day.",
