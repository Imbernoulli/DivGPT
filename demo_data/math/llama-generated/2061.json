        "To determine the profit Natasha, Carla, and Cosima make, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine how much money Carla has:**\n   Natasha has 3 times as much money as Carla. Given that Natasha has $60, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   3C = 60\n   \\]\n   where \\( C \\) is the amount of money Carla has. Solving for \\( C \\):\n   \\[\n   C = \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, Carla has $20.\n\n2. **Determine how much money Cosima has:**\n   Carla has twice as much money as Cosima. Let \\( S \\) be the amount of money Cosima has. We can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   2S = 20\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( S \\):\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n   \\]\n   So, Cosima has $10.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of money they have:**\n   Adding up the amounts of money Natasha, Carla, and Cosima have:\n   \\[\n   60 + 20 + 10 = 90\n   \\]\n   So, they have a total of $90.\n\n4. **Determine the selling price of the goods:**\n   They sell the goods at \\( \\frac{7}{5} \\) of the buying price. The buying price is $90, so the selling price is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7}{5} \\times 90 = \\frac{7 \\times 90}{5} = \\frac{630}{5} = 126\n   \\]\n   So, the selling price is $126.\n\n5. **Calculate the profit:**\n   The profit is the difference between the selling price and the buying price:\n   \\[\n   126 - 90 = 36\n   \\]\n   So, the profit they make is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
        "Let's start by determining how much money Carla and Cosima have. We know that Natasha has 3 times as much money as Carla, and Natasha has $60. Therefore, Carla's money can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Carla's money} = \\frac{\\text{Natasha's money}}{3} = \\frac{60}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Carla has twice as much money as Cosima.
