Since he has filled one and a half pages, we need to multiply the number of words per page by 1.5:\n\\[\n\\text{Words per page} \\times 1.5 = 200 \\times 1.5 = 300 \\text{ words}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's subtract the number of words Leo has written from the total number of words he needs to write:\n\\[\n\\text{Total words needed} - \\text{Words written} = 400 - 300 = 100 \\text{ words}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of words Leo has left to write is \\boxed{100}.",
