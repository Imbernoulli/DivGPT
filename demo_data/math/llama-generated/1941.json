        "To determine how many eggs all the hens will lay in 15 days, we need to first find out how many eggs one hen lays in one day. We know that 10 hens lay 80 eggs in 10 days. Therefore, we can calculate the number of eggs laid by one hen in one day as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by one hen in 10 days:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{80 \\text{ eggs}}{10 \\text{ hens}} = 8 \\text{ eggs per hen in 10 days}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of eggs laid by one hen in one day:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8 \\text{ eggs per hen in 10 days}}{10 \\text{ days}} = 0.8 \\text{ eggs per hen per day}\n   \\]\n\nNow that we know each hen lays 0.8 eggs per day, we can determine the total number of eggs laid by all the hens in 15 days. Martin originally has 10 hens and buys 15 more, so he now has:\n\\[\n10 + 15 = 25 \\text{ hens}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of eggs laid by 25 hens in one day:\n\\[\n25 \\text{ hens} \\times 0.8 \\text{ eggs per hen per day} = 20 \\text{ eggs per day}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of eggs laid by 25 hens in 15 days:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ eggs per day} \\times 15 \\text{ days} = 300 \\text{ eggs}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of eggs all the hens will lay in 15 days is \\boxed{300}.",
