Therefore, the number of cookies he baked on Tuesday is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{32}{2} = 16\n  \\]\n- On Wednesday, he baked three times the number of cookies he baked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of cookies he baked on Wednesday is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 16 = 48\n  \\]\n  However, his brother ate 4 of those cookies, so the number of cookies he had left on Wednesday is:\n  \\[\n  48 - 4 = 44\n  \\]\n\nNext, we sum the number of cookies Zach baked over the three days:\n\\[\n32 + 16 + 44 = 92\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of cookies Zach had at the end of the three days is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{92}\n\\]",

        "To determine how many cookies Zach had at the end of the three days, we need to calculate the number of cookies he baked each day and then sum them up, taking into account the cookies his brother ate.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of cookies Zach baked on each day:\n- On Monday, Zach baked 32 cookies.\n- On Tuesday, Zach baked half of the number of cookies he baked on Monday. So, the number of cookies he baked on Tuesday is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{32}{2} = 16\n  \\]\n- On Wednesday, Zach baked three times the number of cookies he baked on Tuesday. So, the number of cookies he baked on Wednesday is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 16 = 48\n  \\]\n  However, his brother ate 4 of those cookies, so the number of cookies left after his brother ate is:\n  \\[\n  48 - 4 = 44\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of cookies baked over the three days:\n- Cookies baked on Monday: 32\n- Cookies baked on Tuesday: 16\n- Cookies baked on Wednesday (after his brother ate 4): 44\n\nThe total number of cookies Zach had at the end of the three days is:\n\\[\n32 + 16 + 44 = 92\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies Zach had at the end of the three days is \\boxed{92}.",
