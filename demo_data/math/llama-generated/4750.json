        "To determine how much further Mark's bottle cap went than Jenny's, we need to calculate the total distance each bottle cap traveled and then find the difference between these distances.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance Jenny's bottle cap traveled:\n1. Jenny's bottle cap flies 18 feet straight.\n2. It then bounces off a street light and flies another \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the distance it already went. The distance it flies after the bounce is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 18 = 6 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n3.

Mark's bottle cap flies 15 feet forward.\n2. It then bounces off a window and flies twice as far as it already did. The distance it flies after the bounce is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 15 = 30 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n3.
