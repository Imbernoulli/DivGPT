        "To determine how long John's trip took, we need to consider the additional distance he drove out of the way and the distance he had to cover to get back on track.\n\n1. **Calculate John's normal speed:**\n   John's normal trip is 150 miles and takes him 3 hours. Therefore, his speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{150 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ hours}} = 50 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total distance John drove:**\n   John drives 50 miles out of the way and then has to drive 50 miles back to get back on track. So, the additional distance he drove is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ miles (out)} + 50 \\text{ miles (back)} = 100 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n   Adding this to his original trip distance of 150 miles, the total distance he drove is:\n   \\[\n   150 \\text{ miles} + 100 \\text{ miles} = 250 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total time taken:**\n   Since John's speed is 50 miles per hour, the time it took him to drive 250 miles is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{250 \\text{ miles}}{50 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time John's trip took is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) hours.",
