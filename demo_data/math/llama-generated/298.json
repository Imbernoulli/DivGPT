        "To determine the total number of stamps Bella bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. We can represent the number of snowflake stamps as:\n\\[ S = 11 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that Bella bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:\n\\[ T = S + 9 = 11 + 9 = 20 \\]\n\nThen, we are told that Bella bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:\n\\[ R = T - 13 = 20 - 13 = 7 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Bella bought:\n\\[ \\text{Total} = S + T + R = 11 + 20 + 7 = 38 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of stamps Bella bought is:\n\\[ \\boxed{38} \\]",
