        "To determine how many hatchlings 6 turtles produce, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by 6 turtles.\n2. Determine how many of these eggs successfully hatch.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid by 6 turtles.**\n\nEach turtle lays a clutch of 20 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs laid by 6 turtles is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ turtles} \\times 20 \\text{ eggs/turtle} = 120 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many of these eggs successfully hatch.**\n\nWe know that 40% of the eggs successfully hatch. Therefore, the number of hatchlings is:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ eggs} \\times 0.40 = 48 \\text{ hatchlings} \\]\n\nThus, the number of hatchlings produced by 6 turtles is \\(\\boxed{48}\\).",
