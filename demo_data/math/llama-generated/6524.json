He uses 16 light bulbs, so we subtract 16 from 40:\n   \\[\n   40 - 16 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, John has 24 light bulbs left after using 16.\n3. He gives half of the remaining 24 light bulbs to a friend. First, we calculate half of 24:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n   \\]\n   So, John gives 12 light bulbs to his friend.\n4. After giving 12 light bulbs to his friend, John has:\n   \\[\n   24 - 12 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, John has 12 light bulbs left.\n\nTherefore, the number of light bulbs John has left is \\boxed{12}.",

John gives half of the remaining light bulbs to his friend. First, we calculate half of 24:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n   \\]\n   So, John gives 12 light bulbs to his friend.\n4. John subtracts the 12 light bulbs he gave to his friend from the 24 light bulbs he had left:\n   \\[\n   24 - 12 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, John has 12 light bulbs left.\n\nTherefore, the number of light bulbs John has left is \\boxed{12}.",
