        "To determine how many cookies were not eaten, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cookies Javier's wife took.\n2. Determine the number of cookies remaining after his wife took her share.\n3. Subtract the number of cookies his daughter took from the remaining cookies.\n4. Calculate the number of cookies Javier ate.\n5. Determine the number of cookies that were not eaten.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Javier's wife took 30% of the 200 cookies. So, we calculate:\n\\[ 0.30 \\times 200 = 60 \\]\nThis means Javier's wife took 60 cookies.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of cookies his wife took from the total number of cookies to find out how many cookies remain:\n\\[ 200 - 60 = 140 \\]\nSo, there are 140 cookies left after his wife took her share.\n\nThen, his daughter took 40 cookies from the remaining 140 cookies. So, we subtract the number of cookies his daughter took from the remaining cookies:\n\\[ 140 - 40 = 100 \\]\nThis means there are 100 cookies left after his daughter took her share.\n\nNext, Javier ate half of the remaining 100 cookies. So, we calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\]\nThis means Javier ate 50 cookies.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of cookies Javier ate from the remaining cookies to find out how many cookies were not eaten:\n\\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \\]\nSo, the number of cookies that were not eaten is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",

Javier's wife took 30% of the 200 cookies.\n   \\[\n   0.30 \\times 200 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, his wife took 60 cookies.\n\n2. The number of cookies left after his wife took her share is:\n   \\[\n   200 - 60 = 140\n   \\]\n\n3. Javier's daughter took 40 cookies from the remaining 140 cookies.\n   \\[\n   140 - 40 = 100\n   \\]\n   So, there were 100 cookies left after his daughter took her share.\n\n4. Javier ate half of the remaining 100 cookies.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{100}{2} = 50\n   \\]\n   So, Javier ate 50 cookies.\n\n5. The number of cookies left after Javier ate his share is:\n   \\[\n   100 - 50 = 50\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies that were not eaten is \\boxed{50}.",
