        "Let's denote the area of Benedict's house by \\( B \\) square feet. According to the problem, Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times Benedict's house.

We are given that Kennedy's house is 10000 square feet, so we can substitute \\( K = 10000 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ 10000 = 4B + 600 \\]\n\nTo find \\( B \\), we first need to isolate the term involving \\( B \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 600 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 10000 - 600 = 4B \\]\n\\[ 9400 = 4B \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( B \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{9400}{4} \\]\n\\[ B = 2350 \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of Benedict's house is \\(\\boxed{2350}\\) square feet.",

        "To determine the size of Benedict's house, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information. Let \\( B \\) represent the square footage of Benedict's house. According to the problem, Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times the size of Benedict's house. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n\n\\[ K = 4B + 600 \\]\n\nWe are also given that Kennedy's house is 10000 square feet, so we can substitute 10000 for \\( K \\) in the equation:\n\n\\[ 10000 = 4B + 600 \\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate \\( B \\). We do this by first subtracting 600 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 10000 - 600 = 4B \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\n\\[ 9400 = 4B \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( B \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{9400}{4} \\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we find:\n\n\\[ B = 2350 \\]\n\nTherefore, the square footage of Benedict's house is \\(\\boxed{2350}\\).",
