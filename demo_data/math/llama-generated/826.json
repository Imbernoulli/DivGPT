        "To determine the total number of students who wish to go on either the skiing trip or the scavenger hunting trip, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of students who wish to go on the scavenger hunting trip.\n2. Calculate the number of students who wish to go on the skiing trip.\n3. Add the number of students who wish to go on the scavenger hunting trip to the number of students who wish to go on the skiing trip.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n- The number of students who wish to go on the scavenger hunting trip is 4000.\n\nSince the number of students who wish to go on the skiing trip is twice as many as those who wish to go on the scavenger hunting trip, we can calculate the number of students who wish to go on the skiing trip as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4000 = 8000 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of students who wish to go on the scavenger hunting trip to the number of students who wish to go on the skiing trip:\n\\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students is \\(\\boxed{12000}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of students who wish to go on either a skiing trip or a scavenger hunting trip, we start by identifying the number of students who wish to go on each trip.\n\nWe know from the problem statement that the number of students who wish to go on a skiing trip is twice the number of students who wish to go on a scavenger hunting trip. Let's denote the number of students who wish to go on a scavenger hunting trip as \\( S \\). According to the problem, \\( S = 4000 \\).\n\nThe number of students who wish to go on a skiing trip is then \\( 2S \\). Substituting the value of \\( S \\) into this expression, we get:\n\\[ 2S = 2 \\times 4000 = 8000 \\]\n\nTo find the total number of students who wish to go on either trip, we add the number of students who wish to go on a scavenger hunting trip to the number of students who wish to go on a skiing trip:\n\\[ S + 2S = 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students is \\(\\boxed{12000}\\).",

Add the number of students who wish to go on the scavenger hunting trip to the number of students who wish to go on the skiing trip to find the total number of students. This gives us:\n   \\[\n   4000 + 8000 = 12000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of students is \\(\\boxed{12000}\\).",
