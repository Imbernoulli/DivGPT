The second center processes three times that volume:\n\\[ 10000 \\times 3 = 30000 \\text{ packages per day} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total daily package volume for both centers combined.**\n\nAdd the daily package volume of the first center to the daily package volume of the second center:\n\\[ 10000 + 30000 = 40000 \\text{ packages per day} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total weekly package volume.**\n\nThere are 7 days in a week, so multiply the total daily package volume by 7:\n\\[ 40000 \\times 7 = 280000 \\text{ packages per week} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Compute the total weekly profit.**\n\nAmazon makes 5 cents of profit per package.

Therefore, the second center processes:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10000 = 30000 \\text{ packages per day} \\]\n\nNext, we add the daily package volumes of both centers to get the total daily package volume:\n\\[ 10000 + 30000 = 40000 \\text{ packages per day} \\]\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly package volume is:\n\\[ 40000 \\times 7 = 280000 \\text{ packages per week} \\]\n\nAmazon makes 5 cents of profit per package, so the total weekly profit is:\n\\[ 280000 \\times 0.05 = 14000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total profit per week from both centers is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14000} \\]",
