        "To determine the overall labor costs for one day, we need to calculate the daily wages for each type of worker and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Calculate the daily wage for the construction workers:**\n   - Each construction worker makes $100/day.\n   - Jason is hiring two construction workers.\n   - Total daily wage for construction workers: \\( 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate the daily wage for the electrician:**\n   - The electrician makes double what a construction worker is paid.\n   -A construction worker makes $100/day.\n   - Total daily wage for the electrician: \\( 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate the daily wage for the plumber:**\n   - The plumber makes 250% of a construction worker's salary.\n   - A construction worker makes $100/day.\n   - To find 250% of $100, we convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply: \\( 250\\% = 2.5 \\).\n   - Total daily wage for the plumber: \\( 2.5 \\times 100 = 250 \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Sum up the daily wages for all workers:**\n   - Total daily wage for construction workers: $200.\n   - Total daily wage for the electrician: $200.\n   - Total daily wage for the plumber: $250.\n   - Overall labor costs for one day: \\( 200 + 200 + 250 = 650 \\) dollars.\n\nThus, the overall labor costs for one day are \\(\\boxed{650}\\).",
