Subtract the sum of the land used for the house, farm machinery, future expansion, and cattle rearing from the total land to find the land used for crop production.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The total land used for the house and farm machinery is 25 hectares.\n2. The total land reserved for future expansion is 15 hectares.\n3. The total land used for rearing cattle is 40 hectares.\n4. The total land used for the house, farm machinery, future expansion, and cattle rearing is:\n   \\[\n   25 + 15 + 40 = 80 \\text{ hectares}\n   \\]\n5. The total land Job has is 150 hectares.
