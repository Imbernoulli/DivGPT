        "To determine the average number of leaves falling per hour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of leaves that fell over the three hours.\n2. Divide the total number of leaves by the total number of hours (which is 3) to find the average.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of leaves that fell. We know that 7 leaves fell in the first hour, and 4 leaves fell each in the second and third hours. So, we can write the total number of leaves as:\n\n\\[ 7 + 4 + 4 = 15 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the average number of leaves that fell per hour. We do this by dividing the total number of leaves by the total number of hours:\n\n\\[ \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of leaves which fell per hour is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
