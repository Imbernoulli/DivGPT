Therefore, we need to find 40% of 400.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of invalid documents} = 40\\% \\times 400 = \\frac{40}{100} \\times 400 = 0.4 \\times 400 = 160\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of invalid documents from the total number of documents to find the number of valid documents.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of valid documents} = 400 - 160 = 240\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of valid documents is \\boxed{240}.",
