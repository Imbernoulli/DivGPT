        "To determine how many ounces of water are needed to fill all 10 glasses to the brim, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the current amount of water in each glass:**\n   Each glass has a capacity of 6 ounces, but they are only filled to \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) of their capacity.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Water in each glass} = 6 \\text{ ounces} \\times \\frac{4}{5}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Water in each glass} = \\frac{24}{5} \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Water in each glass} = 4.8 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total amount of water currently in all 10 glasses:**\n   Since each glass contains 4.8 ounces of water, we multiply this by the number of glasses:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total current water} = 4.8 \\text{ ounces/glass} \\times 10 \\text{ glasses}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total current water} = 48 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total capacity of all 10 glasses:**\n   Each glass has a capacity of 6 ounces, so for 10 glasses:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total capacity} = 6 \\text{ ounces/glass} \\times 10 \\text{ glasses}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total capacity} = 60 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many more ounces of water are needed:**\n   Subtract the current total amount of water from the total capacity:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Water needed} = \\text{Total capacity} - \\text{Total current water}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Water needed} = 60 \\text{ ounces} - 48 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Water needed} = 12 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ounces of water needed to fill all 10 glasses to the brim is \\boxed{12}.",

Since each glass has a capacity of 6 ounces and there are currently 4.8 ounces in each glass, the amount of water needed to fill one glass is:\n\\[\n\\text{Water needed for one glass} = 6 - 4.8 = 1.2 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total amount of water needed for all 10 glasses. Since each glass requires 1.2 ounces of water to be filled to the brim, the total amount of water needed for all 10 glasses is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total water needed} = 10 \\times 1.2 = 12 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water needed to fill to the brim all those 10 glasses is \\boxed{12}.",
