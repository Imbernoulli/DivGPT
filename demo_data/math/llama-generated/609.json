        "To determine how many minutes Keegan spends in one of his other classes on average, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total time spent in history and chemistry classes:**\n   Keegan spends 1.5 hours in history and chemistry classes combined.\n\n2. **Convert hours to minutes:**\n   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 1.5 hours to minutes:\n   \\[\n   1.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 90 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total time spent in the other classes:**\n   Keegan is in school for a total of 7.5 hours each day. First, convert 7.5 hours to minutes:\n   \\[\n   7.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 450 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n   Subtract the time spent in history and chemistry classes from the total time:\n   \\[\n   450 \\text{ minutes} - 90 \\text{ minutes} = 360 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of other classes:**\n   Keegan is taking 7 classes in total. Subtract the history and chemistry classes:\n   \\[\n   7 \\text{ classes} - 2 \\text{ classes} = 5 \\text{ classes}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the average time spent in one of the other classes:**\n   Divide the total time spent in the other classes by the number of other classes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{360 \\text{ minutes}}{5 \\text{ classes}} = 72 \\text{ minutes/class}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Keegan spends \\(\\boxed{72}\\) minutes in one of his other classes on average.",

Divide the remaining time by the number of other classes to find the average time spent in one of his other classes.\n4. Convert the average time from hours to minutes.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Keegan spends 1.5 hours on his history and chemistry classes combined.\n\n2. Subtract the time spent on history and chemistry from the total school hours:\n   \\[\n   7.5 \\text{ hours} - 1.5 \\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   So, Keegan spends 6 hours on his other classes.\n\n3.

        "To determine how many minutes Keegan spends in one of his other classes on average, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total time Keegan spends in school each day in minutes:**\n   Keegan is in school for 7.5 hours each day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply:\n   \\[\n   7.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 450 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total time Keegan spends in history and chemistry classes:**\n   Keegan has history and chemistry classes for a combined total of 1.5 hours. Converting this to minutes:\n   \\[\n   1.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 90 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total time Keegan spends in the other classes:**\n   Subtract the time spent in history and chemistry from the total school time:\n   \\[\n   450 \\text{ minutes} - 90 \\text{ minutes} = 360 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of other classes Keegan takes:**\n   Keegan is taking a total of 7 classes, and we already know he takes 2 classes (history and chemistry). Therefore, the number of other classes is:\n   \\[\n   7 - 2 = 5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the average time Keegan spends in one of his other classes:**\n   Divide the total time spent in the other classes by the number of other classes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{360 \\text{ minutes}}{5} = 72 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Keegan spends \\(\\boxed{72}\\) minutes in one of his other classes on average.",
