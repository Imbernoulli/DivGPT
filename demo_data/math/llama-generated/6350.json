Since Martin needs 15 cups, he will need:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ cups} \\div 1 \\text{ cup per package} = 15 \\text{ packages}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the berries:**\n   Each package costs $2.00. Therefore, the total cost for 15 packages is:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ packages} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per package} = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Martin will spend \\(\\boxed{30}\\) dollars on berries in a 30-day period.",
