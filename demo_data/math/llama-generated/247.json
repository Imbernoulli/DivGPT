        "To find out how many stickers Ryan, Steven, and Terry have altogether, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how many stickers Steven has.\n2. Determine how many stickers Terry has.\n3. Add the number of stickers Ryan, Steven, and Terry have.\n\nFirst, we know that Ryan has 30 stickers. Steven has thrice as many stickers as Ryan. Therefore, we calculate the number of stickers Steven has as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Steven's stickers} = 3 \\times \\text{Ryan's stickers} = 3 \\times 30 = 90 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Terry has 20 more stickers than Steven. Therefore, we calculate the number of stickers Terry has as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Terry's stickers} = \\text{Steven's stickers} + 20 = 90 + 20 = 110 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of stickers Ryan, Steven, and Terry have to find the total number of stickers:\n\\[ \\text{Total stickers} = \\text{Ryan's stickers} + \\text{Steven's stickers} + \\text{Terry's stickers} = 30 + 90 + 110 = 230 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of stickers they have altogether is \\(\\boxed{230}\\).",

Calculate the number of stickers Terry has.\n3. Add the number of stickers Ryan, Steven, and Terry have together.\n\nFirst, we know that Ryan has 30 stickers. Since Steven has thrice as many stickers as Ryan, we can calculate the number of stickers Steven has by multiplying Ryan's number of stickers by 3:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of stickers Steven has} = 30 \\times 3 = 90\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Terry has 20 more stickers than Steven. Therefore, we can calculate the number of stickers Terry has by adding 20 to the number of stickers Steven has:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of stickers Terry has} = 90 + 20 = 110\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of stickers Ryan, Steven, and Terry have together:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of stickers} = 30 + 90 + 110 = 230\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of stickers they have altogether is \\boxed{230}.",
