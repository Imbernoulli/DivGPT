For The Lion King:\n\\[\n\\text{Profit of The Lion King} = \\text{Box office earnings} - \\text{Production cost} = 200 \\text{ million} - 10 \\text{ million} = 190 \\text{ million}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Use the profit of The Lion King to find the profit of Star Wars.**\n\nAccording to the problem, the profit of The Lion King is half of the profit of Star Wars. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Profit of The Lion King} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Profit of Star Wars}\n\\]\nSubstituting the profit of The Lion King into the equation:\n\\[\n190 \\text{ million} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Profit of Star Wars}\n\\]\nTo find the profit of Star Wars, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Profit of Star Wars} = 190 \\text{ million} \\times 2 = 380 \\text{ million}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings of Star Wars using its profit and production cost.**\n\nThe total earnings of a movie are calculated by adding the profit to the production cost. For Star Wars:\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings of Star Wars} = \\text{Profit of Star Wars} + \\text{Production cost} = 380 \\text{ million} + 25 \\text{ million} = 405 \\text{ million}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total earnings of Star Wars are \\(\\boxed{405}\\) million.",

Determine the profit of Star Wars based on the given relationship.\n3. Calculate the total earnings of Star Wars.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the profit of The Lion King.**\n\nThe profit of The Lion King is calculated by subtracting the production cost from the box office earnings:\n\\[ \\text{Profit of The Lion King} = \\text{Box office earnings} - \\text{Production cost} = 200 \\text{ million} - 10 \\text{ million} = 190 \\text{ million} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the profit of Star Wars.**\n\nAccording to the problem, the profit of The Lion King is half of what Star Wars made. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the profit of Star Wars:\n\\[ \\text{Profit of The Lion King} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Profit of Star Wars} \\]\n\\[ 190 \\text{ million} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Profit of Star Wars} \\]\n\nTo find the profit of Star Wars, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ \\text{Profit of Star Wars} = 190 \\text{ million} \\times 2 = 380 \\text{ million} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings of Star Wars.**\n\nThe total earnings of Star Wars is the sum of its production cost and its profit:\n\\[ \\text{Total earnings of Star Wars} = \\text{Production cost} + \\text{Profit} = 25 \\text{ million} + 380 \\text{ million} = 405 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total earnings of Star Wars is \\(\\boxed{405}\\) million.",
        "To determine how many millions Star Wars earned, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the profit of The Lion King.\n2. Use the profit of The Lion King to find out the profit of Star Wars.\n3. Determine the total earnings of Star Wars using its profit and production cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the profit of The Lion King. The profit is the difference between the box office earnings and the production cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Profit of The Lion King} = 200 - 10 = 190 \\text{ million dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that the profit of The Lion King is half of what Star Wars made. Therefore, we can find the profit of Star Wars by multiplying the profit of The Lion King by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Profit of Star Wars} = 190 \\times 2 = 380 \\text{ million dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we need to determine the total earnings of Star Wars. The total earnings are the sum of the profit and the production cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings of Star Wars} = 380 + 25 = 405 \\text{ million dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of millions Star Wars earned is \\(\\boxed{405}\\)."
