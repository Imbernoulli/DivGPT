        "To determine how many eggs Gary currently collects every week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of chickens Gary has after two years:**\n   Gary starts with 4 chickens. After two years, he has 8 times as many chickens.\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 8 = 32\n   \\]\n   So, Gary has 32 chickens after two years.\n\n2. **Determine the number of eggs each chicken lays in a week:**\n   Each chicken lays 6 eggs a day. There are 7 days in a week.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 7 = 42\n   \\]\n   So, each chicken lays 42 eggs in a week.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of eggs Gary collects every week:**\n   Gary has 32 chickens, and each chicken lays 42 eggs a week.\n   \\[\n   32 \\times 42 = 1344\n   \\]\n   So, Gary currently collects 1344 eggs every week.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1344}\n\\]",
