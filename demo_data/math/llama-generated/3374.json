        "To determine how many more dollars Alberto spent on his car compared to Samara, we need to calculate the total amount Samara spent and then subtract this from the amount Alberto spent.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount Samara spent. She spent $25 on oil, $467 on tires, and $79 on detailing. We add these amounts together:\n\n\\[\n25 + 467 + 79\n\\]\n\nWe can add these step by step. First, add $25 and $467:\n\n\\[\n25 + 467 = 492\n\\]\n\nNext, add $492 and $79:\n\n\\[\n492 + 79 = 571\n\\]\n\nSo, Samara spent a total of $571 on her car. Now, we need to find out how many more dollars Alberto spent compared to Samara. Alberto spent $2457 on his car. We subtract the total amount Samara spent from the amount Alberto spent:\n\n\\[\n2457 - 571\n\\]\n\nWe can perform the subtraction as follows:\n\n\\[\n2457 - 571 = 1886\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Alberto spent \\(\\boxed{1886}\\) more dollars on his car than Samara.",

        "To determine how many more dollars Alberto spent on his car compared to Samara, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount Samara spent on her car.\n2. Subtract Samara's total expenditure from Alberto's expenditure.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Samara's total expenditure. Samara spent $25 on oil, $467 on tires, and $79 on detailing. Adding these amounts together, we get:\n\n\\[\n25 + 467 + 79\n\\]\n\nWe can add these numbers step by step. First, add $25 and $467:\n\n\\[\n25 + 467 = 492\n\\]\n\nNext, add $492 and $79:\n\n\\[\n492 + 79 = 571\n\\]\n\nSo, Samara spent a total of $571 on her car.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more dollars Alberto spent compared to Samara. Alberto spent $2457 on his car. To find the difference, we subtract Samara's total expenditure from Alberto's expenditure:\n\n\\[\n2457 - 571\n\\]\n\nPerforming the subtraction, we get:\n\n\\[\n2457 - 571 = 1886\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Alberto spent \\(\\boxed{1886}\\) more dollars on his car than Samara.",

Since we can't subtract 7 from 5, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place. This makes the 5 into 15 and the 4 into 3. Now, subtract the tens place: \\(15 - 7 = 8\\). Subtract the hundreds place: \\(3 - 5\\). Since we can't subtract 5 from 3, we need to borrow 1 from the thousands place. This makes the 3 into 13 and the 2 into 1. Now, subtract the hundreds place: \\(13 - 5 = 8\\). Finally, subtract the thousands place: \\(1 - 0 = 1\\).\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n\\[\n2457 - 571 = 1886\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Alberto spent \\(\\boxed{1886}\\) more dollars on his car than Samara.",
