He wants to get better, so he starts practicing.  After a week, he's doubled the amount of time he can do it.  After another week, he's doubled it again from the previous week.  The final week, he's increased it by 50% from the previous week.  How long can Brian hold his breath for now?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
