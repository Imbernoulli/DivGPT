Since he meditates for 30 minutes twice a day, we multiply 30 minutes by 2:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes/meditation} \\times 2 \\text{ meditations/day} = 60 \\text{ minutes/day} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of minutes James spends meditating in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily meditation time by 7:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 420 \\text{ minutes/week} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the total minutes per week into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:\n\\[ 420 \\text{ minutes/week} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 7 \\text{ hours/week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hours a week James spends meditating is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
