The total number of pieces of candy that Taquon and Mack have together is:\n   \\[\n   171 + 171 = 342\n   \\]\n4. To find out how many pieces of candy Jafari has, we subtract the total number of pieces of candy that Taquon and Mack have from the total number of pieces of candy that all three have:\n   \\[\n   418 - 342 = 76\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jafari started with \\(\\boxed{76}\\) pieces of candy."
