Therefore, we can calculate the price of the frame as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Price of the frame} = 60 + 0.20 \\times 60 = 60 + 12 = 72\n\\]\nSo, the frame Yvette initially intended to buy costs $72.\n\nNext, we need to determine the price of the smaller frame.

Determine the price of the smaller frame.\n3. Subtract the price of the smaller frame from Yvette's budget.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the price of the frame Yvette initially intended to buy.**\n\nThe frame Yvette wanted is 20% more expensive than her budget of $60. First, we calculate 20% of $60:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 60 = 12\n\\]\nAdding this amount to her budget gives us the price of the frame:\n\\[\n60 + 12 = 72\n\\]\nSo, the price of the frame Yvette initially intended to buy is $72.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the price of the smaller frame.**\n\nThe smaller frame costs \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the new price of the frame she initially intended to buy. Therefore, we calculate \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of $72:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 72 = 54\n\\]\nSo, the price of the smaller frame is $54.\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the price of the smaller frame from Yvette's budget.**\n\nYvette's budget is $60, and she paid $54 for the smaller frame. Subtracting the price of the smaller frame from her budget gives us:\n\\[\n60 - 54 = 6\n\\]\nSo, the amount of money Yvette remained with is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
