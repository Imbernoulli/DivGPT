Half of these skeletons are adult women, and the remaining number are split evenly between adult men and children.  If an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, and a male has 5 more than this, and a child has half as many as an adult woman, how many bones are in the graveyard?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
