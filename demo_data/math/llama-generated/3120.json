        "Cynthia开始时 harvested 67 potatoes from her garden. After washing them, she cut 13 of them into wedges. This means the number of potatoes left is:\n\\[ 67 - 13 = 54 \\]\n\nNext, she halved the remaining 54 potatoes, so she made french fries with 27 potatoes and potato chips with 27 potatoes. Since one potato can be cut into 8 wedges, the total number of wedges she made is:\n\\[ 13 \\times 8 = 104 \\]\n\nSince one potato can make 20 potato chips, the total number of potato chips she made is:\n\\[ 27 \\times 20 = 540 \\]\n\nTo find out how many more potato chips than wedges Cynthia made, we subtract the number of wedges from the number of potato chips:\n\\[ 540 - 104 = 436 \\]\n\nTherefore, Cynthia made \\(\\boxed{436}\\) more potato chips than wedges.",
