        "To determine the total number of pens Tina has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pen and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that Tina has 12 pink pens.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many green pens Tina has. According to the problem, she has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens. So, we subtract 9 from the number of pink pens:\n\\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \\]\nTherefore, Tina has 3 green pens.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many blue pens Tina has. The problem states that she has 3 more blue pens than green pens. So, we add 3 to the number of green pens:\n\\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \\]\nTherefore, Tina has 6 blue pens.\n\nTo find the total number of pens, we add the number of pink pens, green pens, and blue pens together:\n\\[ 12 + 3 + 6 = 21 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of pens Tina has is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
