        "To determine the number of black cars in the parking lot, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of blue cars.\n2. Calculate the number of red cars.\n3. Subtract the number of blue and red cars from the total number of cars to find the number of black cars.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of blue cars. Since one-third of the cars are blue, we multiply the total number of cars by one-third:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue cars} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 516 = 172\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of red cars. Since one-half of the cars are red, we multiply the total number of cars by one-half:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red cars} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 516 = 258\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of blue and red cars from the total number of cars to find the number of black cars:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of black cars} = 516 - 172 - 258 = 86\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of black cars on the lot is \\boxed{86}.",
