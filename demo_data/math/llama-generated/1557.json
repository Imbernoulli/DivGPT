        "To determine how many glasses of water Rachel should drink on Saturday, we first need to calculate the total amount of water she has already consumed from Sunday to Friday.\n\nStarting with Sunday and Monday:\n- Rachel drinks 2 glasses of water on Sunday.\n- Rachel drinks 4 glasses of water on Monday.\n\nSo, the total for Sunday and Monday is:\n\\[2 + 4 = 6 \\text{ glasses}\\]\n\nNext, Rachel drinks 3 glasses of water each day for the next 4 days (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday). Therefore, the total for these 4 days is:\n\\[3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ glasses}\\]\n\nAdding the water consumed on Sunday and Monday to the water consumed from Tuesday to Friday gives us the total amount of water consumed from Sunday to Friday:\n\\[6 + 12 = 18 \\text{ glasses}\\]\n\nSince each glass of water is 10 ounces, the total amount of water consumed from Sunday to Friday in ounces is:\n\\[18 \\times 10 = 180 \\text{ ounces}\\]\n\nRachel wants to drink a total of 220 ounces of water in the week. Therefore, the amount of water she needs to drink on Saturday is:\n\\[220 - 180 = 40 \\text{ ounces}\\]\n\nSince each glass of water is 10 ounces, the number of glasses of water Rachel should drink on Saturday is:\n\\[40 \\div 10 = 4 \\text{ glasses}\\]\n\nThus, the number of glasses of water Rachel should drink on Saturday is:\n\\[\\boxed{4}\\]",
