        "To determine Jackson's grade, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of time Jackson spends studying.\n2. Determine the increase in his grade based on the time spent studying.\n\nFirst, we know that Jackson spends 9 hours playing video games and 1/3 that much time studying. Therefore, we calculate the time spent studying as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent studying} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 9 = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Jackson's grade increases by 15 points for every hour he spends studying. Since he spends 3 hours studying, we calculate the increase in his grade as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Increase in grade} = 3 \\times 15 = 45 \\text{ points}\n\\]\n\nJackson's grade starts at 0 points, so his final grade is:\n\\[\n\\text{Final grade} = 0 + 45 = 45\n\\]\n\nThus, Jackson's grade is \\boxed{45}.",

Therefore, we calculate the time spent studying as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Time spent studying} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 9 = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Jackson's grade increases by 15 points for every hour he spends studying. Since he spends 3 hours studying, we calculate the increase in his grade as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Increase in grade} = 3 \\times 15 = 45 \\text{ points}\n\\]\n\nSince Jackson's grade starts at 0 points, his final grade is:\n\\[\n\\text{Final grade} = 0 + 45 = 45\n\\]\n\nThus, Jackson's grade is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
