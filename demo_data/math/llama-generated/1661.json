Every 3rd floor has a gate where drivers have to show ID, which takes two minutes. To get from one floor to the next, drivers have to drive 800 feet at 10 feet/second. How long, in seconds, does it take to get to the bottom of the garage from the top?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total time it takes to get from the top of the parking garage to the bottom, we need to consider both the time spent driving between floors and the time spent at the gates.\n\n1. **Calculate the total driving distance:**\n   - The parking garage has 12 floors.\n   - To get from one floor to the next, drivers have to drive 800 feet.\n   - Therefore, the total driving distance is:\n     \\[\n     12 \\times 800 = 9600 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total driving time:**\n   - staggeredthed driving speed is 10 feet per second.\n   - Therefore, the total driving time is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{9600 \\text{ feet}}{10 \\text{ feet/second}} = 960 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of gates:**\n   - Every 3rd floor has a gate.\n   - The floors with gates are the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th floors.\n   - Therefore, there are 4 gates.\n\n4. **Calculate the total time spent at gates:**\n   - Each gate takes 2 minutes to pass through.\n   - Convert minutes to seconds:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ minutes} = 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the total time spent at gates is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 120 = 480 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total time to get to the bottom:**\n   - Add the total driving time and the total time spent at gates:\n     \\[\n     960 \\text{ seconds} + 480 \\text{ seconds} = 1440 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total time it takes to get to the bottom of the garage from the top is \\(\\boxed{1440}\\) seconds.",
        "To determine the total time it takes to get from the top of the parking garage to the bottom, we need to consider both the time taken to drive down each floor and the time taken to show ID at the gates.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes to drive down each floor. The distance between each floor is 800 feet, and the speed of the driver is 10 feet per second. Therefore, the time to drive down each floor is:\n\\[\n\\frac{800 \\text{ feet}}{10 \\text{ feet/second}} = 80 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many gates the driver will encounter on the way down. Since the garage has 12 floors and a gate is located every 3rd floor, the gates are on the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th floors. This means the driver will encounter 4 gates. At each gate, it takes 2 minutes (which is 120 seconds) to show ID. Therefore, the total time spent at the gates is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 120 \\text{ seconds} = 480 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total time taken to drive down all 12 floors. Since there are 12 floors, the total driving time is:\n\\[\n12 \\times 80 \\text{ seconds} = 960 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nAdding the time spent at the gates to the total driving time gives us the total time to get to the bottom of the garage from the top:\n\\[\n960 \\text{ seconds} + 480 \\text{ seconds} = 1440 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes to get to the bottom of the garage from the top is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1440}\n\\]",
