        "To determine how many kilometers longer Telegraph Road is than Pardee Road, we need to first ensure that both lengths are in the same unit of measurement. Since the length of Telegraph Road is given in kilometers and the length of Pardee Road is given in meters, we need to convert the length of Pardee Road from meters to kilometers.\n\nWe know that 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters. Therefore, to convert 12000 meters to kilometers, we divide 12000 by 1000:\n\\[\n12000 \\text{ meters} = \\frac{12000}{1000} \\text{ kilometers} = 12 \\text{ kilometers}\n\\]\n\nNow that we have both lengths in kilometers, we can find the difference between the length of Telegraph Road and the length of Pardee Road:\n\\[\n162 \\text{ kilometers} - 12 \\text{ kilometers} = 150 \\text{ kilometers}\n\\]\n\nThus, Telegraph Road is \\boxed{150} kilometers longer than Pardee Road.",

Subtract the length of Pardee Road from the length of Telegraph Road.\n\nFirst, let's convert the length of Pardee Road from meters to kilometers. We know that 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters. Therefore, we can convert 12000 meters to kilometers by dividing by 1000:\n\n\\[ 12000 \\text{ meters} = \\frac{12000}{1000} \\text{ kilometers} = 12 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nNow, we know that Pardee Road is 12 kilometers long. Next, we subtract the length of Pardee Road from the length of Telegraph Road:\n\n\\[ 162 \\text{ kilometers} - 12 \\text{ kilometers} = 150 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nSo, Telegraph Road is \\(\\boxed{150}\\) kilometers longer than Pardee Road.",
        "To determine how many kilometers longer Telegraph Road is than Pardee Road, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the length of Pardee Road from meters to kilometers.**\n   - We know that 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters.\n   - Therefore, to convert 12000 meters to kilometers, we divide by 1000:\n     \\[\n     12000 \\text{ meters} \\div 1000 = 12 \\text{ kilometers}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the difference in length between Telegraph Road and Pardee Road.**\n   - Telegraph Road is 162 kilometers long.\n   - Pardee Road is 12 kilometers long.\n   - To find out how many kilometers longer Telegraph Road is, we subtract the length of Pardee Road from the length of Telegraph Road:\n     \\[\n     162 \\text{ kilometers} - 12 \\text{ kilometers} = 150 \\text{ kilometers}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Telegraph Road is \\(\\boxed{150}\\) kilometers longer than Pardee Road.",
        "To determine how many kilometers longer Telegraph Road is than Pardee Road, we first need to ensure that both lengths are in the same unit of measurement. Since the length of Telegraph Road is given in kilometers and the length of Pardee Road is given in meters, we need to convert the length of Pardee Road from meters to kilometers.\n\nWe know that:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ kilometer} = 1000 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nTherefore, to convert 12000 meters to kilometers, we divide by 1000:\n\\[ 12000 \\text{ meters} = \\frac{12000}{1000} \\text{ kilometers} = 12 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nNow that both lengths are in kilometers, we can find the difference between the length of Telegraph Road and Pardee Road:\n\\[ 162 \\text{ kilometers} - 12 \\text{ kilometers} = 150 \\text{ kilometers} \\]\n\nThus, Telegraph Road is \\(\\boxed{150}\\) kilometers longer than Pardee Road."
