        "To determine how much money Ian has left after paying off his debts, we need to calculate the amount he paid to each person step by step.\n\n1. **Payment to Colin:**\n   Ian paid $20 to Colin.\n\n2. **Payment to Helen:**\n   Ian paid twice as much to Helen as he did to Colin. Therefore, the payment to Helen is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 20 = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Payment to Benedict:**\n   Ian paid half as much to Benedict as he did to Helen.
