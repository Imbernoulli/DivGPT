        "To determine how many minutes it will take to deliver all the cars, we need to calculate how many stations the train will stop at and how much time it will take to delivered all the cars.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many stations the train will stop at. The train starts with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars. At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car. Therefore, the number of stations required to deliver all the cars is determined by the car that runs out first.\n\nFor the coal cars:\n\\[\n\\frac{6 \\text{ coal cars}}{2 \\text{ coal cars per station}} = 3 \\text{ stations}\n\\]\n\nFor the iron cars:\n\\[\n\\frac{12 \\text{ iron cars}}{3 \\text{ iron cars per station}} = 4 \\text{ stations}\n\\]\n\nFor the wood cars:\n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\text{ wood cars}}{1 \\text{ wood car per station}} = 2 \\text{ stations}\n\\]\n\nThe train will stop at the maximum number of stations required to deliver all the cars, which is 4 stations.\n\nNext, we calculate the total travel time.

        "To determine how many minutes it will take to deliver all the cars, we need to calculate how many stations the train will need to stop at to deposit all the cars. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of stations needed for each type of car:**\n   - Coal cars: The train starts with 6 coal cars and can deposit up to 2 coal cars at each station. Therefore, the number of stations needed to deposit all the coal cars is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n     \\]\n   - Iron cars: The train starts with 12 iron cars and can deposit up to 3 iron cars at each station. Therefore, the number of stations needed to deposit all the iron cars is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n     \\]\n   - Wood cars: The train starts with 2 wood cars and can deposit up to 1 wood car at each station. Therefore, the number of stations needed to deposit all the wood cars is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{1} = 2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of stations needed:**\n   - The train will need to stop at the maximum number of stations required for any type of car to ensure all cars are deposited. Therefore, the total number of stations needed is:\n     \\[\n     \\max(3, 4, 2) = 4\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total travel time:**\n   - The train travels 6 miles between each station and it takes 25 minutes to travel between them. Therefore, the total travel time for 4 stations is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 25 = 100 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total time it will take to deliver all the cars is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) minutes.",
        "To determine the total time it will take to deliver all the cars, we need to calculate how many stations the train will stop at to deposit all the cars and then multiply by the travel time between stations.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many stations the train will stop at for each type of car:\n- The train starts with 6 coal cars and can deposit up to 2 coal cars at each station.

Therefore, the number of stations needed to deposit all the wood cars is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2}{1} = 2\n  \\]\n\nThe train will stop at the maximum number of stations required for any type of car, which is 4 stations (for the iron cars). This means the train will travel between stations 4 times.\n\nThe time taken to travel between each station is 25 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken to travel between 4 stations is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 25 = 100 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time it will take to deliver all the cars is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{100}\n\\]",

The train starts with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars. At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car.\n\nWe calculate the number of stations needed for each type of car:\n- For coal cars: \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) stations\n- For iron cars: \\( \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\) stations\n- For wood cars: \\( \\frac{2}{1} = 2 \\) stations\n\nThe train must visit the maximum number of stations required by any type of car, which is 4 stations for the iron cars. Therefore, the train will visit 4 stations to deposit all the cars.\n\nSince it takes 25 minutes to travel between each station, and the train travels between 4 stations, it will travel a total of 4 intervals. The total time taken to travel between these stations is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 25 = 100 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThus, the total time it will take to deliver all the cars is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) minutes.",
        "To determine how many minutes it will take for the train to deliver all the cars, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of stops required to deposit all the cars.\n2. Determine the total travel time between these stops.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of stops required.**\n\nThe train starts with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars. At each station, it can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car.\n\n- For coal cars: The train needs to deposit 6 coal cars. Since it can deposit 2 coal cars per stop, it will take \\( \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\) stops.\n- For iron cars: The train needs to deposit 12 iron cars. Since it can deposit 3 iron cars per stop, it will take \\( \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\) stops.\n- For wood cars: The train needs to deposit 2 wood cars. Since it can deposit 1 wood car per stop, it will take \\( \\frac{2}{1} = 2 \\) stops.\n\nThe train needs to make the maximum number of stops required by any type of car, which is 4 stops for the iron cars.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total travel time between these stops.**\n\nSince there are 4 stops, there will be 4 segments of travel between the stations (one less than the number of stops). Each segment is 6 miles and takes 25 minutes to travel.\n\nThe total travel time is \\( 4 \\times 25 = 100 \\) minutes.\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take to deliver all the cars is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) minutes.",
        "To determine how many minutes it will take for the train to deliver all the cars, we need to calculate the number of stations the train must visit and then multiply by the travel time between each station.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of stations required for each type of car:\n- The train starts with 6 coal cars and can deposit up to 2 coal cars at each station. Therefore, the number of stations needed to deliver all the coal cars is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n  \\]\n- The train starts with 12 iron cars and can deposit up to 3 iron cars at each station.

Therefore, the number of stations needed to deliver all the wood cars is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2}{1} = 2\n  \\]\n\nThe train must visit the maximum number of stations required for any type of car, which is 4 stations (for the iron cars). This is because the train will have delivered all the coal cars and all the wood cars by the time it visits the 4th station, and it will have delivered all the iron cars by then as well.\n\nSince there are 6 miles between each station and it takes 25 minutes to travel between them, the total travel time for 4 stations is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 25 = 100 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take to deliver all the cars is \\(\\boxed{100}\\) minutes.",
