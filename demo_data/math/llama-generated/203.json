The bridge can hold 20,000 pounds. Donna's empty truck weighs 12,000 pounds. She's carrying 20 crates of soda that each weigh 50 pounds, 3 dryers that each weigh 3000 pounds, and twice as much weight in fresh produce as in soda. How much does Donna's fully loaded truck weigh?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
