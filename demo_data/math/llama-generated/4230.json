        "To determine how many horses Mickey mounts per week, we start by defining the variables and using the given information to set up equations.\n\nFirst, let \\( M \\) represent the number of days Minnie mountsotes per day. According to the problem, Minnie mounts three more horses per day than there are days in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can write:\n\\[\nM = 7 + 3\n\\]\nSimplifying this, we find:\n\\[\nM = 10\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Mickey mounts six less than twice as many horses per day as Minnie. Therefore, we can express the number of horses Mickey mounts per day as:\n\\[\n2M - 6\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( M = 10 \\) into this equation, we get:\n\\[\n2(10) - 6 = 20 - 6 = 14\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of horses Mickey mounts per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of horses Mickey mounts per day by 7:\n\\[\n14 \\times 7 = 98\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of horses Mickey mounts per week is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{98}\n\\]",
