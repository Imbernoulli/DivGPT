        "To determine how much money James spends on coursework materials, we first need to calculate the amounts he spends on food, accommodation, and entertainment.\n\n1.

        "To determine how much money James spends on coursework materials, we need to calculate the percentage of his budget that is allocated to coursework materials and then find the corresponding amount in dollars.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the percentage of James's budget that he spends on food, accommodation, and entertainment:\n- Food: \\(30\\%\\)\n- Accommodation: \\(15\\%\\)\n- Entertainment: \\(25\\%\\)\n\nAdding these percentages together gives:\n\\[30\\% + 15\\% + 25\\% = 70\\%\\]\n\nSince James spends 70% of his budget on food, accommodation, and entertainment, the remaining percentage of his budget is spent on coursework materials:\n\\[100\\% - 70\\% = 30\\%\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much 30% of James's $1000 budget is.
