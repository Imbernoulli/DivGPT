        "To determine how much lower the price of the television was than the amount Martin decided to spend, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial discount:**\n   Martin decided to spend no more than $1,000, and the sales clerk offered him the TV for $100 less.\n   \\[\n   1000 - 100 = 900\n   \\]\n   So, after the initial discount, the price of the TV is $900.\n\n2. **Calculate the additional discount:**\n   The sales clerk then offered an additional 20% off the reduced price. First, we need to find 20% of $900.\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 900 = 180\n   \\]\n   So, the additional discount is $180.\n\n3. **Calculate the final price of the TV:**\n   Subtract the additional discount from the reduced price.\n   \\[\n   900 - 180 = 720\n   \\]\n   So, the final price of the TV is $720.\n\n4. **Determine how much lower the final price is compared to Martin's initial budget:**\n   Martin decided to spend no more than $1,000. Subtract the final price from $1,000.\n   \\[\n   1000 - 720 = 280\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the price of the television was \\(\\boxed{280}\\) dollars lower than the amount Martin decided to spend.",

Calculate 20% of the initial discounted price and subtract it from the initial discounted price to get the final price.\n4.

Find the difference between the original price Martin decided to spend and the final price of the television.\n\nLet's start with the initial price. Martin decided to spend no more than $1,000, so the initial price of the television set is $1,000.\n\nNext, the sales clerk offered him the TV for $100 less.

Find the difference between the amount Martin decided to spend and the final price of the television set.\n\nFirst, let's assume the initial price of the television set is \\( P \\). According to the problem, Martin decided to spend no more than $1,000, so \\( P \\leq 1000 \\). The sales clerk offered him the TV for $100 less, so the price after the first discount is \\( P - 100 \\).\n\nNext, the sales clerk offered an additional 20% off the reduced price. A 20% discount means the customer pays 80% of the reduced price.
