        "To determine how many slices of pizza James eats, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the total number of pizza slices. James orders an 8-piece pizza.\n2. Subtract the number of slices his friend eats. His friend eats 2 slices.\n   \\[\n   8 - 2 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, there are 6 slices left after his friend eats.\n3. James eats half of what is left. Since there are 6 slices left, James eats:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of slices James eats is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

Subtract the number of slices his friend eats. His friend eats 2 slices.\n   \\[\n   8 - 2 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, there are 6 slices left after his friend eats.\n3. James eats half of the remaining slices. Since there are 6 slices left, James eats:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n   So, James eats 3 slices.\n\nTherefore, the number of slices James eats is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
