        "To determine how many shells Alan collected, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how many shells Ben collected.\n2. Use the number of shells Ben collected to find out how many shells Alan collected.\n\nFirst, we know that Laurie collected 36 shells. Ben collected a third of what Laurie did. Therefore, we calculate the number of shells Ben collected as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of shells Ben collected} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 36 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did. Therefore, we calculate the number of shells Alan collected as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of shells Alan collected} = 4 \\times 12 = 48\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of shells Alan collected is \\(\\boxed{48}\\).",
