        "To determine how many people ate the pizza, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten:**\n   - The pizza was originally cut into 16 slices.\n   - After eating, there are 4 slices left.\n   - Therefore, the number of slices eaten is:\n     \\[\n     16 - 4 = 12\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many slices each person ate:**\n   - Each person ate 2 slices.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of people who ate the pizza:**\n   - To find the number of people, we divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices each person ate:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of people who ate the pizza is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
