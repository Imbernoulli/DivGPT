        "Let's start by determining how many games Henry has after giving five games to Neil. Initially, Henry had 33 games. After giving five games to Neil, Henry has:\n\n\\[ 33 - 5 = 28 \\]\n\nLet \\( n \\) be the number of games Neil had initially. After receiving five games from Henry, Neil has:\n\n\\[ n + 5 \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, after the transaction, Henry has 4 times more games than Neil. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ 28 = 4(n + 5) \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( n \\).
