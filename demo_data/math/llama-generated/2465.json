Use the number of digits Carlos memorized to find out how many digits Sam memorized.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of digits Carlos memorized as \\( C \\). According to the problem, Mina memorized six times as many digits as Carlos. We know that Mina memorized 24 digits, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ 6C = 24 \\]\n\nTo find \\( C \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\\[ C = \\frac{24}{6} = 4 \\]\n\nSo, Carlos memorized 4 digits of pi.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many digits Sam memorized. The problem states that Sam memorized six more digits than Carlos. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ S = C + 6 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( C \\) that we found:\n\\[ S = 4 + 6 = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Sam memorized \\(\\boxed{10}\\) digits of pi.",
