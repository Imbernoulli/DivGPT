Subtract the number of cars that left the parking lot. According to the problem, 13 cars left.\n   \\[\n   80 - 13 = 67\n   \\]\n   So, after 13 cars left, there are 67 cars remaining.\n3. Add the number of cars that entered the parking lot. The problem states that 5 more cars went in than left. Since 13 cars left, the number of cars that entered is:\n   \\[\n   13 + 5 = 18\n   \\]\n   Now, add these 18 cars to the 67 cars that remained after the 13 cars left.\n   \\[\n   67 + 18 = 85\n   \\]\n   So, after the cars entered, there are 85 cars in the parking lot.\n\nTherefore, the number of cars in the parking lot now is \\boxed{85}.",
