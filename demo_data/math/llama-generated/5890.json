        "To find out the cost of a printer, we start by defining the cost of a printer as \\( p \\) dollars. According to the problem, the merchant bought 15 keyboards and 25 printers for a total of $2050. We know that each keyboard costs $20. Therefore, the total cost of the keyboards is \\( 15 \\times 20 = 300 \\) dollars. The total cost of the printers is \\( 25 \\times p \\) dollars. The sum of these two amounts is equal to the total cost of $2050. We can write this relationship as:\n\n\\[\n300 + 25p = 2050\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to solve for \\( p \\). First, we subtract 300 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n25p = 2050 - 300\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n25p = 1750\n\\]\n\nNow, we divide both sides of the equation by 25:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{1750}{25}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\np = 70\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of a printer is \\(\\boxed{70}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine the cost of a printer, we start by identifying the given information and setting up an equation based on it. The merchant bought 15 keyboards and 25 printers for a total of $2050. We know that each keyboard costs $20.
