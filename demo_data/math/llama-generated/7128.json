        "To determine the total cost of replacing the floor in Tom's room, we need to consider two main components: the cost of removing the old floor and the cost of installing the new floor.\n\n1. **Cost of removing the old floor:**\n   The cost to remove the old floor is given as $50.\n\n2. **Cost of installing the new floor:**\n   - First, we need to calculate the area of Tom's room.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 8 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 7 \\, \\text{feet} = 56 \\, \\text{square feet}\n     \\]\n   - Next, we calculate the cost of the new floor per square foot, which is $1.25.\n   - The total cost for the new floor is the area multiplied by the cost per square foot:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost for new floor} = 56 \\, \\text{square feet} \\times 1.25 \\, \\text{dollars per square foot} = 70 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total cost of replacing the floor:**\n   - We add the cost of removing the old floor to the total cost of the new floor:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of removing old floor} + \\text{Total cost for new floor} = 50 \\, \\text{dollars} + 70 \\, \\text{dollars} = 120 \\, \\text{dollars}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost to replace the floor is \\(\\boxed{120}\\) dollars.",

        "To determine the total cost to replace the floor in Tom's room, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the area of Tom's room.\n2. Determine the cost of the new floor based on the area.\n3. Add the cost of removing the old floor to the cost of the new floor.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the area of Tom's room.**\n\nTom's room is 8 feet by 7 feet. The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n\\]\nSubstituting the given dimensions:\n\\[\nA = 8 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 7 \\, \\text{feet} = 56 \\, \\text{square feet}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost of the new floor.**\n\nThe new floor costs $1.25 per square foot. To find the total cost of the new floor, we multiply the area by the cost per square foot:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of new floor} = 56 \\, \\text{square feet} \\times 1.25 \\, \\text{dollars per square foot}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of new floor} = 70 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the cost of removing the old floor to the cost of the new floor.**\n\nThe cost to remove the old floor is $50. To find the total cost to replace the floor, we add the cost of the new floor to the cost of removing the old floor:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 70 \\, \\text{dollars} + 50 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 120 \\, \\text{dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost to replace the floor is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
