        "To determine the year Julia was born, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Wayne's birth year:**\n   Wayne is 37 years old in 2021. To find his birth year, we subtract his age from the current year:\n   \\[\n   2021 - 37 = 1984\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Wayne was born in 1984.\n\n2. **Determine Peter's age:**\n   Peter is 3 years older than Wayne. Since Wayne is 37 years old, we add 3 years to Wayne's age:\n   \\[\n   37 + 3 = 40\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Peter is 40 years old.\n\n3. **Determine Julia's age:**\n   Julia is 2 years older than Peter. Since Peter is 40 years old, we add 2 years to Peter's age:\n   \\[\n   40 + 2 = 42\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Julia is 42 years old.\n\n4. **Determine Julia's birth year:**\n   Julia is 42 years old in 2021. To find her birth year, we subtract her age from the current year:\n   \\[\n   2021 - 42 = 1979\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Julia was born in 1979.\n\nThus, the year Julia was born is \\(\\boxed{1979}\\).",

Since Peter is 3 years older than Wayne, we can calculate Peter's age as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Peter's age} = \\text{Wayne's age} + 3 = 37 + 3 = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Julia is 2 years older than Peter. Therefore, we can calculate Julia's age as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Julia's age} = \\text{Peter's age} + 2 = 40 + 2 = 42 \\]\n\nSince Julia is 42 years old in 2021, we can find the year she was born by subtracting her age from the year 2021:\n\\[ \\text{Year Julia was born} = 2021 - \\text{Julia's age} = 2021 - 42 = 1979 \\]\n\nThus, Julia was born in the year \\(\\boxed{1979}\\).",
