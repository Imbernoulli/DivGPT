The total cost for the field trip is the sum of the cost of the bus and the cost of admission for the students. The cost of the bus is $100, and the cost of admission per student is $10. Therefore, the total cost can be expressed as:\n\\[ 100 + 10x \\]\n\nWe know that the class has a budget of $350, so we need to set up the following inequality:\n\\[ 100 + 10x \\leq 350 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( x \\) by isolating the variable. First, subtract 100 from both sides of the inequality:\n\\[ 10x \\leq 250 \\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by 10:\n\\[ x \\leq 25 \\]\n\nThis tells us that the maximum number of students that can go on the field trip is 25. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]",
