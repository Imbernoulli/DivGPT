        "To determine how many more crayons Nori gave to Lea than Mae, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of crayons Nori initially had.\n2. Determine how many crayons Nori gave away in total.\n3. Find out how many crayons Nori gave to Lea.\n4. Calculate the difference in the number of crayons given to Lea and Mae.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of crayons Nori initially had.**\n\nNori had 4 boxes of crayons with 8 crayons in each box:\n\\[ 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\]\nSo, Nori initially had 32 crayons.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many crayons Nori gave away in total.**\n\nNori has 15 crayons left after giving some away. Therefore, the total number of crayons she gave away is:\n\\[ 32 - 15 = 17 \\]\nSo, Nori gave away 17 crayons in total.\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many crayons Nori gave to Lea.**\n\nNori gave 5 crayons to Mae. Let \\( L \\) be the number of crayons she gave to Lea. According to the problem, the total number of crayons given away is 17:\n\\[ 5 + L = 17 \\]\nTo find \\( L \\), we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ L = 17 - 5 = 12 \\]\nSo, Nori gave 12 crayons to Lea.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the difference in the number of crayons given to Lea and Mae.**\n\nThe difference in the number of crayons given to Lea and Mae is:\n\\[ 12 - 5 = 7 \\]\nSo, Nori gave 7 more crayons to Lea than Mae.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]",

Let's denote the number of crayons she gave to Lea as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the total number of crayons given away plus the number of crayons left should equal the initial total number of crayons.

Let's call the number of crayons she gave to Lea \\( x \\). After giving crayons to both Mae and Lea, Nori has 15 crayons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of crayons Nori had initially:\n\n\\[ 32 - 5 - x = 15 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 27 - x = 15 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 15 from 27:\n\n\\[ 27 - 15 = x \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ x = 12 \\]\n\nNori gave 12 crayons to Lea. We need to find out how many more crayons she gave to Lea than to Mae. Since she gave 5 crayons to Mae, we subtract the number of crayons given to Mae from the number of crayons given to Lea:\n\n\\[ 12 - 5 = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, Nori gave \\(\\boxed{7}\\) more crayons to Lea than to Mae.",
        "First, we need to determine the total number of crayons Nori initially had. She had 4 boxes of crayons, with each box containing 8 crayons. Therefore, the total number of crayons is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Nori gave 5 crayons to Mae and some crayons to Lea, and she has 15 crayons left. Let's denote the number of crayons she gave to Lea as \\( x \\). The total number of crayons given away can be expressed as the sum of the crayons given to Mae and Lea:\n\n\\[ 5 + x \\]\n\nSince the total number of crayons Nori had initially minus the total number of crayons she gave away equals the number of crayons she has left, we can write the following equation:\n\n\\[ 32 - (5 + x) = 15 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 32 - 5 - x = 15 \\]\n\\[ 27 - x = 15 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 15 from 27:\n\n\\[ 27 - 15 = x \\]\n\\[ x = 12 \\]\n\nSo, Nori gave 12 crayons to Lea. To find out how many more crayons she gave to Lea than to Mae, we subtract the number of crayons given to Mae from the number of crayons given to Lea:\n\n\\[ 12 - 5 = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, Nori gave \\(\\boxed{7}\\) more crayons to Lea than to Mae.",
