        "To determine the total number of infections during the second wave in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of infections per day during the second wave.\n2. Determine the total number of days in 2 weeks.\n3. Multiply the number of infections per day by the total number of days in 2 weeks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of infections per day during the second wave. We know that the number of cases increased by four times more per day compared to the first wave. In the first wave, there were 300 infections per day. Therefore, the number of infections per day during the second wave is:\n\\[ 300 + 4 \\times 300 = 300 + 1200 = 1500 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of days in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days in 2 weeks is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of infections per day by the total number of days in 2 weeks to find the total number of infections during the second wave:\n\\[ 1500 \\times 14 = 21000 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of infections during the second wave in 2 weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{21000} \\]",
