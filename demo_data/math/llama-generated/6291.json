        "To determine James's profit from a 600-mile trip, we need to calculate both his earnings and his expenses, and then find the difference between the two.\n\n1. **Calculate Earnings:**\n   James gets paid $0.50 per mile.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate total earnings:**\n   James gets paid $0.50 per mile. For a 600 mile trip, his total earnings are:\n   \\[\n   600 \\text{ miles} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/mile} = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate total expenses for gas:**\n   James's truck gets 20 miles per gallon, so for a 600 mile trip, the number of gallons of gas he needs is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{600 \\text{ miles}}{20 \\text{ miles/gallon}} = 30 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   The cost of gas is $4.00 per gallon, so his total expenses for gas are:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ gallons} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars/gallon} = 120 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate profit:**\n   Profit is calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the total earnings:\n   \\[\n   300 \\text{ dollars} - 120 \\text{ dollars} = 180 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, James's profit from a 600 mile trip is \\(\\boxed{180}\\).",
