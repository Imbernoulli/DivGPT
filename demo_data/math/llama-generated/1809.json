        "First, we determine how much Geoff spent on sneakers today. According to the problem, he spent $60.\n\nNext, we calculate how much Geoff will spend on sneakers tomorrow. The problem states that he will spend 4 times as much on sneakers as he did today. Therefore, we multiply $60 by 4:\n\\[ 60 \\times 4 = 240 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate how much Geoff will spend on sneakers on Wednesday. The problem states that he will spend 5 times as much on sneakers as he did today. Therefore, we multiply $60 by 5:\n\\[ 60 \\times 5 = 300 \\]\n\nNow, we add up the amounts spent over the three days to find the total amount Geoff will spend on sneakers. We add $60 (today), $240 (tomorrow), and $300 (Wednesday):\n\\[ 60 + 240 + 300 = 600 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Geoff will spend on sneakers over these three days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{600} \\]",
        "To determine how much Geoff will spend on sneakers over the three days, we need to calculate his spending for each day and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much Geoff spent on sneakers today:\n- Geoff bought 2 pairs of sneakers and spent $60 equally between the two.\n- Therefore, he spent \\(\\frac{60}{2} = 30\\) dollars per pair.\n- Since he bought 2 pairs, the total spending today is \\(2 \\times 30 = 60\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much Geoff will spend on sneakers tomorrow:\n- Tomorrow, he plan to spend 4 times as much as he did today.\n- Therefore, his spending tomorrow is \\(4 \\times 60 = 240\\) dollars.\n\nThen, let's calculate how much Geoff will spend on sneakers on Wednesday:\n- On Wednesday, he plan to spend 5 times as much as he did today.\n- Therefore, his spending on Wednesday is \\(5 \\times 60 = 300\\) dollars.\n\nFinally, let's sum up his spending over the three days:\n- Today: \\(60\\) dollars\n- Tomorrow: \\(240\\) dollars\n- Wednesday: \\(300\\) dollars\n\nAdding these amounts together:\n\\[ 60 + 240 + 300 = 600 \\]\n\nThus, Geoff will spend \\(\\boxed{600}\\) dollars on sneakers over these three days.",
