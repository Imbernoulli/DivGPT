        "To determine the number of kittens in the pet shop, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.\n\nLet \\( k \\) be the number of kittens in the pet shop. The cost of each puppy is $20, and the cost of each kitten is $15. The pet shop has 2 puppies and some kittens, and the total value of the stock is $100. Therefore, we can write the following equation to represent the total value of the stock:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 20 + 15 \\times k = 100 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the 2 puppies:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 20 = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we substitute this value back into the equation:\n\n\\[ 40 + 15k = 100 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( k \\), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 15k = 60 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( k \\) by dividing both sides by 15:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{60}{15} = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of kittens in the pet shop is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
