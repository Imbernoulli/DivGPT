        "To determine how many weeks of daily tea Marco gets from a box of 28 ounces of tea leaves, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days Marco can brew tea from one box.\n2. Convert the total number of days into weeks.\n\nFirst, we find out how many days Marco can brew tea from one box. Since Marco uses \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of an ounce of tea leaves each day, the number of days he can brew tea from a 28-ounce box is:\n\\[\n28 \\div \\frac{1}{5} = 28 \\times 5 = 140 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nNext, we convert the total number of days into weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks Marco can brew tea from one box is:\n\\[\n140 \\div 7 = 20 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of weeks of daily tea Marco gets from a box is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
