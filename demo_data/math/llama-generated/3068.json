        "To determine how many hours long the bus ride needs to be for Biff to break even, we first calculate Biff's total expenses for the trip. Biff spends $11 on the ticket, $3 on drinks and snacks, and $16 on a new pair of headphones. Adding these amounts together gives:\n\n\\[11 + 3 + 16 = 30\\]\n\nSo, Biff's total expenses for the trip are $30. Next, we need to determine Biff's net earnings per hour. Biff makes $12 per hour working online, but he has to pay $2 per hour to access the bus's WiFi. Therefore, his net earnings per hour are:\n\n\\[12 - 2 = 10\\]\n\nTo find out how many hours long the bus ride needs to be for Biff to break even, we divide his total expenses by his net earnings per hour:\n\n\\[30 \\div 10 = 3\\]\n\nThus, the bus ride needs to be \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours long for Biff to break even.",

        "To determine how many hours long the bus ride needs to be for Biff to break even, we need to calculate the total expenses Biff incurs and then find out how many hours he needs to work online to cover those expenses.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Biff's total expenses for the bus trip:\n- Ticket: $11\n- Drinks and snacks: $3\n- Headphones: $16\n\nAdding these amounts together gives:\n\\[ 11 + 3 + 16 = 30 \\]\nSo, Biff's total expenses are $30.\n\nNext, let's determine how much Biff earns and spends per hour on the bus. Biff earns $12 per hour working online but has to pay $2 per hour to access the bus's WiFi. Therefore, his net earnings per hour are:\n\\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \\]\nSo, Biff net earns $10 per hour.\n\nTo find out how many hours he needs to work to break even, we divide his total expenses by his net earnings per hour:\n\\[ 30 \\div 10 = 3 \\]\nSo, Biff needs to work for 3 hours to break even.\n\nTherefore, the bus ride needs to be \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours long.",
