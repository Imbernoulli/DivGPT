        "To find the original price of the car, we start by understanding that Eunice spent $7500, which is 25% less than the original price. This means that $7500 is 75% of the original price. Let's denote the original price by \\( P \\).\n\nSince $7500 is 75% of the original price, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 7500 = 0.75P \\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), we need to solve for \\( P \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:\n\\[ P = \\frac{7500}{0.75} \\]\n\nNext, we perform the division:\n\\[ P = \\frac{7500}{0.75} = \\frac{7500 \\times 100}{0.75 \\times 100} = \\frac{750000}{75} = 10000 \\]\n\nThus, the original price of the car is \\(\\boxed{10000}\\).",
        "To find the original price of the car, we start by letting \\( P \\) represent the original price. According to the problem, Eunice spent $7500 on the car, which is 25% less than the original price. This means she paid 75% of the original price, since 100% - 25% = 75%.\n\nWe can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\\[ 7500 = 0.75P \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( P \\), we need to isolate \\( P \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:\n\\[ P = \\frac{7500}{0.75} \\]\n\nNext, we perform the division:\n\\[ P = \\frac{7500}{0.75} = 10000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the original price of the car was \\(\\boxed{10000}\\)."
