        "To determine the total amount Tim spent on animals for his zoo, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the llamas separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the goats:\n- Tim buys 3 goats.\n- Each goat costs $400.\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \\times 400 = 1200\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the llamas:\n- Tim gets twice as many llamas as goats. Since he bought 3 goats, he gets:\n\\[\n2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ llamas}\n\\]\n- Each llama costs 50% more than each goat.

Add the cost of the goats and the cost of the llamas to find the total amount spent.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the goats:\nTim buys 3 goats, and each goat costs $400.\n\\[\n3 \\times 400 = 1200\n\\]\nSo, the total cost for the goats is $1200.\n\nNext, let's determine the number of llamas and their cost:\nTim gets twice as many llamas as goats. Since he bought 3 goats, he gets:\n\\[\n2 \\times 3 = 6\n\\]\nllamas. Each llama costs 50% more than each goat. Since each goat costs $400, each llama costs:\n\\[\n400 + 0.5 \\times 400 = 400 + 200 = 600\n\\]\nSo, the total cost for the llamas is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 600 = 3600\n\\]\nSo, the total cost for the llamas is $3600.\n\nFinally, let's add the cost of the goats and the cost of the llamas to find the total amount spent:\n\\[\n1200 + 3600 = 4800\n\\]\nSo, the total amount Tim spent is \\boxed{4800}.",
