        "To determine how many friends Chenny has, we start by defining the number of friends as \\( f \\).\n\nEach friend will receive 2 candies. Therefore, the total number of candies needed is:\n\\[\n2f\n\\]\n\nChenny currently has 10 pieces of candy and realizes she needs to buy 4 more. This means the total number of candies she will have after buying 4 more is:\n\\[\n10 + 4 = 14\n\\]\n\nSince the total number of candies needed is equal to the total number of candies she will have, we set up the equation:\n\\[\n2f = 14\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( f \\), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[\nf = \\frac{14}{2} = 7\n\\]\n\nThus, Chenny has \\(\\boxed{7}\\) friends."
