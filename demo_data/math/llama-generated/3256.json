We can express this relationship mathematically as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of toys Hash has} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Number of toys Bill has} + 9\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the number of toys Bill has into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of toys Hash has} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 + 9\n\\]\n\nFirst, we calculate half of 60:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 = 30\n\\]\n\nThen, we add 9 to 30:\n\n\\[\n30 + 9 = 39\n\\]\n\nSo, Hash has 39 toys.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of toys that both boys have by adding the number of toys Bill has to the number of toys Hash has:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of toys} = \\text{Number of toys Bill has} + \\text{Number of toys Hash has}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of toys} = 60 + 39\n\\]\n\nAdding these together, we get:\n\n\\[\n60 + 39 = 99\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of toys that the boys have is \\boxed{99}.",
