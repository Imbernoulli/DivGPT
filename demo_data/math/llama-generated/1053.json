Subtract the total length of the introduction and the conclusion from the total length of the essay to find the total length of the body sections.\n4. Divide the total length of the body sections by the number of body sections to find the length of each body section.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1.

Therefore, the length of the conclusion is:\n\n\\[ 450 \\times 3 = 1350 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nNext, we find the total length of the introduction and the conclusion combined:\n\n\\[ 450 + 1350 = 1800 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nSince the essay has to be 5000 words in total, we subtract the length of the introduction and the conclusion from the total word count to find out how many words are needed for the body sections:\n\n\\[ 5000 - 1800 = 3200 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nThe essay has four body sections, and each section is the same length. Therefore, we divide the total length of the body sections by 4 to find the length of each section:\n\n\\[ 3200 \\div 4 = 800 \\text{ words} \\]\n\nThus, the length of each body section is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{800} \\]",

Subtract the total length of the introduction and conclusion from the total word count to find the length of the body sections:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total length of body sections} = \\text{Total word count} - \\text{Total length of introduction and conclusion} = 5000 - 1800 = 3200 \\text{ words}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the length of each body section:**\n   There are four body sections, and they are all the same length. Divide the total length of the body sections by the number of sections to find the length of each section:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of each body section} = \\frac{\\text{Total length of body sections}}{\\text{Number of body sections}} = \\frac{3200}{4} = 800 \\text{ words}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of each body section is \\boxed{800}.",
