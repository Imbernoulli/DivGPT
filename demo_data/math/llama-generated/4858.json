        "To determine the cost of one deck of basketball cards, we start by calculating the total amount of money Mary spent. Mary bought two pairs of sunglasses for $50 each and a pair of jeans for $100. The cost of the sunglasses is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAdding the cost of the jeans, the total amount Mary spent is:\n\n\\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince Mary and Rose spent the same amount, Rose also spent $200. Rose bought a pair of shoes for $150 and two decks of basketball cards. Let the cost of one deck of basketball cards be \\( x \\). The total cost of the basketball cards is:\n\n\\[ 2x \\]\n\nThe total amount Rose spent is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the cost of the basketball cards:\n\n\\[ 150 + 2x = 200 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x = 200 - 150 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 50 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{50}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 25 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of one deck of basketball cards is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
