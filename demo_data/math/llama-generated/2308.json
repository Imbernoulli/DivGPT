        "To determine the number of men in the engineering department, we start by letting \\( x \\) represent the total number of students. According to the problem, 70% of the students are men, which means that 30% of the students are women. We know that the number of women is 180. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 0.30x = 180 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.30:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{180}{0.30} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 600 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of students in the engineering department is 600. Since 70% of the students are men, we can find the number of men by calculating 70% of 600:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of men} = 0.70 \\times 600 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of men} = 420 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of men in the engineering department is \\(\\boxed{420}\\).",
