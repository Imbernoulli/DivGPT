John's hair grows 1.5 inches every month. He cuts his hair when it reaches 9 inches and reduces it to 6 inches. Therefore, the length of hair he needs to grow between haircuts is:\n\\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nSince his hair grows 1.5 inches every month, the time it takes for his hair to grow 3 inches is:\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\text{ inches}}{1.5 \\text{ inches/month}} = 2 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nThis means John gets a haircut every 2 months. To find out how many haircuts he gets in a year, we divide the number of months in a year by the number of months between haircuts:\n\\[ \\frac{12 \\text{ months}}{2 \\text{ months/haircut}} = 6 \\text{ haircuts/year} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost of each haircut. The haircut itself costs $45, and he gives a 20% tip. The tip amount is:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 45 = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of one haircut is:\n\\[ 45 + 9 = 54 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTo find the total cost of haircuts in a year, we multiply the cost of one haircut by the number of haircuts he gets in a year:\n\\[ 54 \\text{ dollars/haircut} \\times 6 \\text{ haircuts/year} = 324 \\text{ dollars/year} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount John spends on haircuts in a year is:\n\\[ \\boxed{324} \\]",
