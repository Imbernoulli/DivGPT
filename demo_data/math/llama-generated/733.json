Therefore, the number of remaining peaches is:\n\\[ 125 - 5 = 120 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many smaller boxes can be made with the remaining peaches.**\n\nEach smaller box contains 15 peaches. Therefore, the number of boxes is:\n\\[ 120 \\div 15 = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the number of boxes of peaches is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
        "First, we calculate the total number of peaches delivered to the market. Since there are 5 baskets and each basket contains 25 peaches, we multiply the number of baskets by the number of peaches per basket:\n\\[\n5 \\times 25 = 125\n\\]\nThis means there are 125 peaches in total.\n\nNext, we account for the peaches that the farmers have eaten. The farmers have eaten 5 peaches, so we subtract this number from the total number of peaches:\n\\[\n125 - 5 = 120\n\\]\nThis means there are 120 peaches remaining.\n\nNow, we need to pack the remaining peaches into smaller boxes, with each box containing 15 peaches. To find out how many boxes we need, we divide the number of remaining peaches by the number of peaches per box:\n\\[\n120 \\div 15 = 8\n\\]\nThis means there are 8 boxes of peaches.\n\nTherefore, the number of boxes of peaches is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
