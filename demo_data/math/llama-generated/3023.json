        "To determine how many cars Frank needs to sell for the remaining days to meet his quota, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cars sold in the first three days:**\n   Frank sold 5 cars each day for 3 days.\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ cars/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 15 \\text{ cars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of cars sold in the next four days:**\n   Frank sold 3 cars each day for 4 days.\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ cars/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 12 \\text{ cars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of cars sold in the first seven days:**\n   Add the cars sold in the first three days and the next four days.\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ cars} + 12 \\text{ cars} = 27 \\text{ cars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of cars remaining to be sold:**\n   Frank needs to sell a total of 50 cars.

So, the total number of cars sold in the next four days is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\text{ cars/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 12 \\text{ cars}\n  \\]\n\n- Adding the cars sold in the first three days and the next four days gives:\n  \\[\n  15 \\text{ cars} + 12 \\text{ cars} = 27 \\text{ cars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of cars sold so far from the monthly quota to find out how many cars Frank still needs to sell:\n\n\\[\n50 \\text{ cars} - 27 \\text{ cars} = 23 \\text{ cars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Frank needs to sell \\boxed{23} cars for the remaining days to meet his quota.",
