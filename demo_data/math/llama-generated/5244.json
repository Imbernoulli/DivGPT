        "To determine the area of Blossom's room in square inches, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the length of each side of the room from feet to inches.\n2. Calculate the area of the room in square inches.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 12 inches in a foot. Since the room is 10 feet long in each direction, we convert the length and width from feet to inches:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 120 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNow, the room is a square with each side measuring 120 inches. The area \\( A \\) of a square is given by the formula:\n\\[ A = \\text{side} \\times \\text{side} \\]\n\nSubstituting the side length into the formula, we get:\n\\[ A = 120 \\text{ inches} \\times 120 \\text{ inches} = 14400 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of Blossom's room is \\(\\boxed{14400}\\) square inches.",
        "To find the area of Blossom's room in square inches, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the length and width of the room in inches.\n2. Calculate the area using the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width.\n\nFirst, we know that the room is 10 feet long in each direction. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length and width from feet to inches:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ feet} = 10 \\times 12 = 120 \\text{ inches} \\]\nSo, the length of the room is 120 inches and the width of the room is also 120 inches.\n\nNext, we use the formula for the area of a rectangle:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = 120 \\text{ inches} \\times 120 \\text{ inches} = 14400 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of Blossom's room is \\(\\boxed{14400}\\) square inches.",
