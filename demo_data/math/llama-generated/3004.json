        "To determine the total number of marbles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the number of clay pots:**\n   The craftsman makes 16 jars, which is exactly twice the number of clay pots.

Since there are 16 jars:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Marbles in jars} = 16 \\times 5 = 80\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of marbles in the clay pots:**\n   Each clay pot has three times as many marbles as each jar. Since each jar has 5 marbles, each clay pot has:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ marbles}\n   \\]\n   Since there are 8 clay pots:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Marbles in clay pots} = 8 \\times 15 = 120\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the total number of marbles:**\n   Add the number of marbles in the jars and the number of marbles in the clay pots:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total marbles} = 80 + 120 = 200\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of marbles is \\(\\boxed{200}\\).",

Therefore, the number of clay pots is:\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{2} = 8\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of marbles in the jars. Each jar has 5 marbles, so the total number of marbles in the jars is:\n\\[\n16 \\times 5 = 80\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total number of marbles in the clay pots. Each clay pot has three times as many marbles as each jar, so each clay pot has:\n\\[\n5 \\times 3 = 15 \\text{ marbles}\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of marbles in the clay pots is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 15 = 120\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of marbles from the jars and the clay pots to get the total number of marbles:\n\\[\n80 + 120 = 200\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of marbles is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{200}\n\\]",

Add the number of marbles in the jars and the clay pots to get the total number of marbles.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\nThe craftsman made 16 jars, which is exactly twice the number of clay pots he made. Therefore, the number of clay pots is:\n\\[ \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of marbles in the jars. Each jar has 5 marbles, so the total number of marbles in the jars is:\n\\[ 16 \\times 5 = 80 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the number of marbles in the clay pots. Each clay pot has three times as many marbles as each jar, so each clay pot has:\n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\]\nTherefore, the total number of marbles in the clay pots is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 15 = 120 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of marbles in the jars and the clay pots to get the total number of marbles:\n\\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of marbles is:\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]",

Therefore, the number of clay pots is:\n\\[ \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of marbles in the jars. Each jar has 5 marbles, and there are 16 jars. So, the total number of marbles in the jars is:\n\\[ 16 \\times 5 = 80 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of marbles in the clay pots. Each clay pot has three times as many marbles as each jar. Since each jar has 5 marbles, each clay pot has:\n\\[ 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\nmarbles. There are 8 clay pots, so the total number of marbles in the clay pots is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 15 = 120 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of marbles in the jars and the number of marbles in the clay pots to get the total number of marbles:\n\\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of marbles is:\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]",
