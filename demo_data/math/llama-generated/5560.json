        "To determine the number of chickens free ranging, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of chickens in the coop.\n2. Calculate the number of chickens in the run.\n3. Determine the number of chickens free ranging based on the number of chickens in the run.\n\nFirst, we know there are 14 chickens in the coop. The problem states that there are twice as many chickens in the run as in the coop. Therefore, we calculate the number of chickens in the run as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\times 14 = 28\n\\]\nSo, there are 28 chickens in the run.\n\nNext, the problem states that there are 4 less than double the number of chickens free ranging as in the run. To find the number of chickens free ranging, we first double the number of chickens in the run and then subtract 4:\n\\[\n2 \\times 28 - 4 = 56 - 4 = 52\n\\]\nSo, the number of chickens free ranging is \\boxed{52}.",
