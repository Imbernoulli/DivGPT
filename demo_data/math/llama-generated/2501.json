        "To determine the total amount of money Ravi has, we start by identifying the number of each type of coin he possesses based on the given information.\n\nFirst, we know that Ravi has 6 nickels. Let's denote the number of nickels by \\( N \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ N = 6 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that Ravi has 2 more quarters than nickels. Let's denote the number of quarters by \\( Q \\). Therefore, we can express the number of quarters as:\n\\[ Q = N + 2 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( N \\):\n\\[ Q = 6 + 2 = 8 \\]\n\nThen, we are told that Ravi has 4 more dimes than quarters. Let's denote the number of dimes by \\( D \\). Therefore, we can express the number of dimes as:\n\\[ D = Q + 4 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( Q \\):\n\\[ D = 8 + 4 = 12 \\]\n\nNow, we know the number of each type of coin:\n- Nickels: 6\n- Quarters: 8\n- Dimes: 12\n\nNext, we calculate the value of each type of coin. The value of each nickel is $0.05$, so the total value of the nickels is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 0.05 = 0.30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe value of each quarter is $0.25$, so the total value of the quarters is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 0.25 = 2.00 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe value of each dime is $0.10$, so the total value of the dimes is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 0.10 = 1.20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the values of all the coins to find the total amount of money Ravi has:\n\\[ 0.30 + 2.00 + 1.20 = 3.50 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Ravi has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3.50} \\]",
        "To determine how much money Ravi has, we need to find out how many quarters and dimes he has, and then calculate the total value of all his coins.\n\n1. First, we know that Ravi has 6 nickels.\n2. According to the problem, Ravi has 2 more quarters than nickels. Therefore, the number of quarters is:\n   \\[\n   6 + 2 = 8\n   \\]\n3. The problem also states that Ravi has 4 more dimes than quarters. Therefore, the number of dimes is:\n   \\[\n   8 + 4 = 12\n   \\]\n4.

        "To determine how much money Ravi has, we need to find out how many quarters and dimes he has based on the number of nickels he has. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the number of nickels:**\n   Ravi has 6 nickels.\n\n2. **Determine the number of quarters:**\n   Ravi has 2 more quarters than nickels. Therefore, the number of quarters is:\n   \\[\n   6 + 2 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, Ravi has 8 quarters.\n\n3. **Determine the number of dimes:**\n   Ravi has 4 more dimes than quarters. Therefore, the number of dimes is:\n   \\[\n   8 + 4 = 12\n   \\]\n   So, Ravi has 12 dimes.\n\n4. **Calculate the total value of the nickels:**\n   Each nickel is worth $0.05. Therefore, the total value of the nickels is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 0.05 = 0.30\n   \\]\n   So, the total value of the nickels is $0.30.\n\n5. **Calculate the total value of the quarters:**\n   Each quarter is worth $0.25. Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 0.25 = 2.00\n   \\]\n   So, the total value of the quarters is $2.00.\n\n6. **Calculate the total value of the dimes:**\n   Each dime is worth $0.10. Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 0.10 = 1.20\n   \\]\n   So, the total value of the dimes is $1.20.\n\n7. **Calculate the total value of all the coins:**\n   Add the total value of the nickels, quarters, and dimes:\n   \\[\n   0.30 + 2.00 + 1.20 = 3.50\n   \\]\n   So, the total value of all the coins is $3.50.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Ravi has is \\(\\boxed{3.50}\\).",
