        "To determine how many hours it takes the dog groomer to dry all of the dogs, we need to calculate the time required for each type of dog and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time it takes to dry the short-haired dogs.

Since it takes twice as long to dry a full-haired dog as it does a short-haired dog, it takes \\( 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\) minutes to dry one full-haired dog. Therefore, the time to dry 9 full-haired dogs is:\n\\[ 9 \\times 20 = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we add the time required to dry the short-haired dogs and the full-haired dogs to get the total time required:\n\\[ 60 + 180 = 240 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 240 minutes into hours by dividing by 60:\n\\[ 240 \\div 60 = 4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total time it takes the dog groomer to dry all of the dogs is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]",
