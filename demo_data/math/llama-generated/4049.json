        "To determine how many pieces of bread Sally eats across Saturday and Sunday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of sandwiches Sally eats over the two days.\n2. Determine how many pieces of bread are used for the total number of sandwiches.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of sandwiches Sally eats:\n- On Saturday, Sally eats 2 sandwiches.\n- On Sunday, Sally eats 1 sandwich.\n- Therefore, the total number of sandwiches Sally eats is \\(2 + 1 = 3\\).\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pieces of bread are used for these 3 sandwiches. Since each sandwich uses 2 pieces of bread, we multiply the total number of sandwiches by the number of pieces of bread per sandwich:\n- The total number of pieces of bread is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n\nSo, the total number of pieces of bread Sally eats across Saturday and Sunday is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
