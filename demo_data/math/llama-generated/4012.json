        "To determine how many calories Jean consumes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of donuts Jean eats.\n2. Determine the total calories consumed from the donuts.\n\nFirst, we know that Jean eats one donut for every 2 pages she writes. If she writes 12 pages, we can find the number of donuts she eats by dividing the total number of pages by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of donuts} = \\frac{12 \\text{ pages}}{2 \\text{ pages/donut}} = 6 \\text{ donuts}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that each donut has 150 calories.

To find out the total number of calories Jean eats, we multiply the number of donuts by the calories per donut:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total calories} = 6 \\text{ donuts} \\times 150 \\text{ calories/donut} = 900 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of calories Jean eats is \\boxed{900}.",

Determine the total calories consumed from the donuts.\n\nFirst, we know that Jean eats one donut for every 2 pages she writes. If she writes 12 pages, we can find the number of donuts she eats by dividing the total number of pages by 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{12 \\text{ pages}}{2 \\text{ pages/donut}} = 6 \\text{ donuts}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that each donut has 150 calories. To find the total number of calories Jean consumes, we multiply the number of donuts by the calories per donut:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ donuts} \\times 150 \\text{ calories/donut} = 900 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of calories Jean eats is \\boxed{900}."
