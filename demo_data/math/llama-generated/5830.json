        "To determine the total distance the Frisbees have traveled, we need to analyze the throws of both Bess and Holly separately.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance the Frisbees travel when Bess throws them. Bess can throw the Frisbee as far as 20 meters and she does this 4 times. Each time she throws the Frisbee, she throws it back to her original position. Therefore, each throw and catch covers a distance of \\(20 \\text{ meters} \\times 2 = 40 \\text{ meters}\\).\n\nSince Bess does this 4 times, the total distance for Bess's throws is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 40 \\text{ meters} = 160 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance the Frisbees travel when Holly throws them. Holly can throw the Frisbee as far as 8 meters and she does this 5 times. Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands, so each throw covers a distance of 8 meters.\n\nSince Holly does this 5 times, the total distance for Holly's throws is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 8 \\text{ meters} = 40 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nTo find the total distance traveled by all the Frisbees, we add the distance traveled by Bess's throws and Holly's throws:\n\\[\n160 \\text{ meters} + 40 \\text{ meters} = 200 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance the Frisbees have traveled is \\(\\boxed{200}\\).",
