        "Let's denote the amount of money in Yasmin's bank account before she deposited the check as \\( x \\). After depositing the $50 check, her new balance becomes \\( x + 50 \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the $50 check is worth a quarter of her new balance. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 50 = \\frac{1}{4}(x + 50) \\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[ 4 \\cdot 50 = x + 50 \\]\n\\[ 200 = x + 50 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting 50 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 200 - 50 = x \\]\n\\[ 150 = x \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money in Yasmin's account before she deposited the check was \\(\\boxed{150}\\).",
