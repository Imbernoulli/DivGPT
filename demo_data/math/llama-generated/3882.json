        "To determine the total number of animals for sale in the pet store, we need to calculate the number of each type of animal and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Dogs**: The pet store has 6 dogs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of dogs} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cats**: The pet store has half as many cats as dogs. Therefore, the number of cats is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cats} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Birds**: The pet store has twice as many birds as dogs. Therefore, the number of birds is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of birds} = 6 \\times 2 = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fish**: The pet store has thrice as many fish as dogs. Therefore, the number of fish is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of fish} = 6 \\times 3 = 18\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the number of dogs, cats, birds, and fish to get the total number of animals:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of animals} = 6 + 3 + 12 + 18 = 39\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of animals for sale in the pet store is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{39}\n\\]",
