        "To determine how many flowers are left in Peter's garden after he gives some to his brother, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of flowers in Peter's garden before he gives any away.\n2. Subtract the number of flowers Peter gives to his brother from the total number of flowers he initially has.\n\nFirst, we find out how many flowers Peter has initially. Since Peter's garden contains three times as many flowers as Amanda's garden, we multiply the number of flowers in Amanda's garden by 3:\n\\[ 20 \\times 3 = 60 \\]\nSo, Peter initially has 60 flowers.\n\nNext, we subtract the 15 flowers Peter gives to his brother from the 60 flowers he initially has:\n\\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \\]\nTherefore, the number of flowers left in Peter's garden is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",

        "To determine how many flowers are left in Peter's garden after he gives 15 flowers to his brother, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of flowers in Peter's garden initially.\n   Amanda's garden contains 20 flowers. Since Peter's garden contains three times as many flowers as Amanda's, we multiply 20 by 3:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 3 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, Peter's garden initially has 60 flowers.\n\n2. Subtract the number of flowers Peter gave to his brother from the initial number of flowers in his garden.\n   Peter gave 15 flowers to his brother. Therefore, we subtract 15 from 60:\n   \\[\n   60 - 15 = 45\n   \\]\n   So, the number of flowers left in Peter's garden is 45.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{45}\\)."
