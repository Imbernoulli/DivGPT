        "To determine the total population of bears in the park, we need to find the number of each type of bear and then sum them up. Let's start with the information given:\n\n1.

Since Christi saw twice as many black bears as white bears, we can express the number of white bears as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of white bears} = \\frac{\\text{Number of black bears}}{2} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find the number of brown bears. Since Christi saw 40 more brown bears than black bears, we can express the number of brown bears as:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of brown bears} = \\text{Number of black bears} + 40 = 60 + 40 = 100\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of black bears, white bears, and brown bears to find the total population of bears in the park:\n\\[\n\\text{Total population of bears} = \\text{Number of black bears} + \\text{Number of white bears} + \\text{Number of brown bears} = 60 + 30 + 100 = 190\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the population of bears in the park is \\boxed{190}.",

Let's use this information to find the number of white bears and brown bears.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of white bears:**\n   Christi saw twice as many black bears as white bears. Therefore, the number of white bears is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of white bears} = \\frac{\\text{Number of black bears}}{2} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of brown bears:**\n   Christi saw 40 more brown bears than black bears. Therefore, the number of brown bears is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of brown bears} = \\text{Number of black bears} + 40 = 60 + 40 = 100\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total population of bears:**\n   The total population of bears is the sum of the number of black bears, white bears, and brown bears:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total population of bears} = \\text{Number of black bears} + \\text{Number of white bears} + \\text{Number of brown bears} = 60 + 30 + 100 = 190\n   \\]\n\nThus, the population of bears in the park is \\(\\boxed{190}\\).",
