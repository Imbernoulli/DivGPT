        "To determine the size of Martha's bedroom, we start by defining variables for the sizes of the bedrooms. Let \\( M \\) represent the square footage of Martha's bedroom. According to the problem, Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, so we can express Jenny's bedroom size as \\( M + 60 \\).\n\nThe total square footage of the two bedrooms is given as 300 square feet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\nM + (M + 60) = 300\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n2M + 60 = 300\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( M \\), we first subtract 60 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n2M = 240\n\\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nM = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, Martha's bedroom is \\(\\boxed{120}\\) square feet.",
        "To determine the size of Martha's bedroom, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:\n\n- Let \\( M \\) be the area of Martha's bedroom in square feet.\n- Let \\( J \\) be the area of Jenny's bedroom in square feet.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. The total area of the two bedrooms is 300 square feet.\n2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's bedroom.\n\nWe can express these two pieces of information as the following equations:\n1. \\( M + J = 300 \\)\n2. \\( J = M + 60 \\)\n\nNow, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \\( M \\):\n\\[ M + (M + 60) = 300 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ 2M + 60 = 300 \\]\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2M = 240 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[ M = 120 \\]\n\nSo, Martha's bedroom is \\(\\boxed{120}\\) square feet. To verify, we can find the area of Jenny's bedroom using the second equation:\n\\[ J = M + 60 = 120 + 60 = 180 \\]\n\nThen, we check that the total area of the two bedrooms is indeed 300 square feet:\n\\[ M + J = 120 + 180 = 300 \\]\n\nThe calculations are correct, confirming that Martha's bedroom is \\(\\boxed{120}\\) square feet.",

Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\nx + (x + 60) = 300\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n2x + 60 = 300\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate \\( x \\). We do this by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n2x = 240\n\\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, the square footage of Martha's bedroom is \\(\\boxed{120}\\) square feet.",
