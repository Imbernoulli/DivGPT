        "Let's define the purchase price of the first commodity as \\( x \\) and the purchase price of the second commodity as \\( y \\). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information that we can express as equations.\n\nThe first piece of information is that the total cost of purchasing both commodities is $827. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ x + y = 827 \\]\n\nThe second piece of information is that the purchase price of the first commodity exceeds the purchase price of the second commodity by $127. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ x = y + 127 \\]\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for \\( x \\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\\[ (y + 127) + y = 827 \\]\n\nSimplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 2y + 127 = 827 \\]\n\nNext, isolate the term with \\( y \\) by subtracting 127 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2y = 827 - 127 \\]\n\\[ 2y = 700 \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( y \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ y = \\frac{700}{2} \\]\n\\[ y = 350 \\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\( y \\), we can find the value of \\( x \\) using the second equation:\n\\[ x = y + 127 \\]\n\\[ x = 350 + 127 \\]\n\\[ x = 477 \\]\n\nTherefore, the purchase price of the first commodity is \\(\\boxed{477}\\).",
