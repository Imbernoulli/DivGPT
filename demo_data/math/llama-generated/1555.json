        "To determine how much money Enrico earned from selling the roosters, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the earnings from the 30-kilogram rooster.\n2. Calculate the earnings from the 40-kilogram rooster.\n3. Add the earnings from both roosters to get the total earnings.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the earnings from the 30-kilogram rooster:\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from 30-kilogram rooster} = 30 \\text{ kg} \\times \\$0.50 \\text{ per kg} = 30 \\times 0.50 = \\$15\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the earnings from the 40-kilogram rooster:\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from 40-kilogram rooster} = 40 \\text{ kg} \\times \\$0.50 \\text{ per kg} = 40 \\times 0.50 = \\$20\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the earnings from both roosters to get the total earnings:\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings} = \\$15 + \\$20 = \\$35\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Enrico was able to earn is \\boxed{35}.",

Sum the earnings from both roosters.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much Enrico earned from the 30-kilogram rooster:\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from 30-kilogram rooster} = 30 \\text{ kg} \\times \\$0.50/\\text{kg} = \\$15\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find out how much Enrico earned from the 40-kilogram rooster:\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings from 40-kilogram rooster} = 40 \\text{ kg} \\times \\$0.50/\\text{kg} = \\$20\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the earnings from both roosters to find the total earnings:\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings} = \\$15 + \\$20 = \\$35\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Enrico was able to earn is \\boxed{35}.",
        "To determine how much money Enrico earned from selling the roosters, we need to calculate the earnings from each rooster separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the earnings from the 30-kilogram rooster:\n- The price per kilogram is $0.50.\n- The weight of the rooster is 30 kilograms.\n- Therefore, the earnings from the 30-kilogram rooster are:\n  \\[\n  30 \\text{ kg} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/kg} = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the earnings from the 40-kilogram rooster:\n- The price per kilogram is $0.50.\n- The weight of the rooster is 40 kilograms.\n- Therefore, the earnings from the 40-kilogram rooster are:\n  \\[\n  40 \\text{ kg} \\times 0.50 \\text{ dollars/kg} = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we sum the earnings from both roosters to find the total earnings:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ dollars} + 20 \\text{ dollars} = 35 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Enrico was able to earn is \\boxed{35}.",
