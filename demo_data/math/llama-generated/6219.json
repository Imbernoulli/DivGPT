        "To determine how many hours Martiza will need to study for the citizenship test, we need to calculate the total time required for each type of question and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time needed for the multiple-choice questions:\n- There are 30 multiple-choice questions.\n- It takes her 15 minutes to learn each multiple-choice question.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time for multiple-choice questions} = 30 \\text{ questions} \\times 15 \\text{ minutes/question} = 450 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time needed for the fill-in-the-blank questions:\n- There are 30 fill-in-the-blank questions.\n- It takes her 25 minutes to learn each fill-in-the-blank question.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time for fill-in-the-blank questions} = 30 \\text{ questions} \\times 25 \\text{ minutes/question} = 750 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the total time for both types of questions to find the total study time:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total study time} = 450 \\text{ minutes} + 750 \\text{ minutes} = 1200 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we convert the total study time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total study time in hours} = \\frac{1200 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes/hour}} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, Martiza will need \\boxed{20} hours to study before she is ready for the test.",
        "To determine the total number of hours Martiza needs to study for the citizenship test, we need to calculate the total time required for both the multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions separately and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time needed for the multiple-choice questions:\n- There are 30 multiple-choice questions.\n- It takes Martiza 15 minutes to learn each multiple-choice question.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time for multiple-choice questions} = 30 \\text{ questions} \\times 15 \\text{ minutes/question} = 450 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time needed for the fill-in-the-blank questions:\n- There are 30 fill-in-the-blank questions.\n- It takes Martiza 25 minutes to learn each fill-in-the-blank question.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time for fill-in-the-blank questions} = 30 \\text{ questions} \\times 25 \\text{ minutes/question} = 750 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the total time for both types of questions to find the total study time in minutes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total study time} = 450 \\text{ minutes} + 750 \\text{ minutes} = 1200 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we convert the total study time from minutes to hours.
