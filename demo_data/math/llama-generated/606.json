To calculate this raise:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 112,000 = 22,400\n   \\]\n   Adding this raise to his salary after the first raise:\n   \\[\n   112,000 + 22,400 = 134,400\n   \\]\n   So, Roberto's current salary is \\( \\$134,400 \\).\n\nTherefore, Roberto's current salary is \\(\\boxed{134400}\\).",
