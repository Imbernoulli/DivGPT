Since the mother duck finds 126 snails, each remaining duckling finds:\n\\[ \\frac{126}{2} = 63 \\]\nTherefore, the total number of snails found by the remaining ducklings is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 63 = 126 \\]\n\n**Step 5: Sum up all the snails found by the ducks.**\n\nThe total number of snails found by the family of ducks is the sum of the snails found by the first group, the second group, the mother duck, and the remaining ducklings:\n\\[ 15 + 27 + 126 + 126 = 294 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of snails that the family of ducks has collectively is:\n\\[ \\boxed{294} \\]",
