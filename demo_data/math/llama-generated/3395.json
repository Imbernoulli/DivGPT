        "To determine the total number of meals served by Gordon's three restaurants per week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of meals served per day by all three restaurants.\n2. Multiply the total number of meals served per day by the number of days in a week (7 days).\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of meals served per day by all three restaurants:\n- The first restaurant serves 20 meals per day.\n- The second restaurant serves 40 meals per day.\n- The third restaurant serves 50 meals per day.\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n20 + 40 + 50 = 110 \\text{ meals per day}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of meals served per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:\n\\[\n110 \\text{ meals per day} \\times 7 \\text{ days per week} = 770 \\text{ meals per week}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of meals served by Gordon's three restaurants per week is \\boxed{770}.",
