        "To determine how many weeks Henry and his brother can spend eating 3 boxes of apples, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of apples in 3 boxes.\n2. Determine the total number of apples consumed by Henry and his brother each day.\n3. Calculate the total number of days the apples will last.\n4. Convert the total number of days into weeks.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of apples in 3 boxes.**\n\nEach box contains 14 apples. Therefore, 3 boxes contain:\n\\[ 3 \\times 14 = 42 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of apples consumed by Henry and his brother each day.**\n\nHenry and his brother each eat 1 apple a day, so together they eat:\n\\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \\text{ apples per day} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of days the apples will last.**\n\nThe total number of apples is 42, and they consume 2 apples per day. Therefore, the apples will last:\n\\[ 42 \\div 2 = 21 \\text{ days} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Convert the total number of days into weeks.**\n\nThere are 7 days in a week. Therefore, 21 days is equivalent to:\n\\[ 21 \\div 7 = 3 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nThus, Henry and his brother can spend \\(\\boxed{3}\\) weeks eating 3 boxes of apples.",
