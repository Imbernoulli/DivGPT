        "To determine how much money Josh will have in his wallet after selling all of his stocks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the new value of the business after the stock price rises.\n2. Add the new value of the business to the money Josh already has in his wallet.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the new value of the business. Josh initially has $2000 invested in the business. The stock price rises by 30%, so we need to find 30% of $2000 and add it to the original $2000.\n\nThe increase in the value of the business is:\n\\[ 2000 \\times 0.30 = 600 \\]\n\nSo, the new value of the business is:\n\\[ 2000 + 600 = 2600 \\]\n\nNext, we add the new value of the business to the money Josh already has in his wallet. Josh initially has $300 in his wallet, so we add $2600 to $300:\n\\[ 300 + 2600 = 2900 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Josh will have in his wallet is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2900} \\]",

Josh initially has $2000 invested in the business. If the stock price rises by 30%, the value of the investment will increase by 30% of $2000.

Calculate the new value of Josh's investment after the stock price rises by 30%.\n2. Add the new value of the investment to the amount of money Josh already has in his wallet.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the new value of the investment. Josh initially has $2000 invested. A 30% increase in the stock price means that the value of his investment will be:\n\n\\[ 2000 + (0.30 \\times 2000) \\]\n\nWe can simplify this expression by first calculating \\( 0.30 \\times 2000 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.30 \\times 2000 = 600 \\]\n\nSo, the new value of the investment is:\n\n\\[ 2000 + 600 = 2600 \\]\n\nNext, we add the new value of the investment to the amount of money Josh already has in his wallet. Josh initially has $300 in his wallet, so the total amount of money he will have after selling his stocks is:\n\n\\[ 300 + 2600 = 2900 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Josh will have in his wallet is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2900}\n\\]",

The initial value of the stocks is $2000. A 30% increase means that the value of the stocks will be:\n\n\\[ 2000 + 0.30 \\times 2000 = 2000 + 600 = 2600 \\]\n\nSo, after selling all of his stocks, Josh will get $2600.

Calculate the new value of the business after the stock price rises by 30%.\n2. Add the new value of the business to the money Josh already has in his wallet.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the new value of the business. Josh initially has $2000 invested. A 30% increase in the stock price means that the value of his investment will be:\n\n\\[ 2000 + 2000 \\times 0.30 \\]\n\nWe can simplify this expression as follows:\n\n\\[ 2000 + 600 = 2600 \\]\n\nSo, after the stock price rises by 30%, the value of Josh's business is $2600. Now, we add this amount to the $300 he already has in his wallet:\n\n\\[ 300 + 2600 = 2900 \\]\n\nTherefore, after selling all of his stocks, Josh will have \\(\\boxed{2900}\\) dollars in his wallet.",
