        "To determine how many citrus orchards will be growing grapefruits, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of orchards for lemons:**\n   The problem states that lemons will take up 8 orchards.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of orchards for oranges:**\n   The problem states that oranges will occupy half as many orchards as the lemons. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n   \\]\n   So, oranges will occupy 4 orchards.\n\n3. **Determine the total number of orchards for lemons and oranges:**\n   We add the number of orchards for lemons and the number of orchards for oranges:\n   \\[\n   8 + 4 = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of remaining orchards:**\n   The total number of orchards is 16. We subtract the number of orchards occupied by lemons and oranges from the total number of orchards:\n   \\[\n   16 - 12 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, there are 4 remaining orchards.\n\n5. **Determine the number of orchards for limes and grapefruits:**\n   The problem states that limes and grapefruits will split the remaining orchards equally. Therefore, we divide the remaining orchards by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n   So, each fruit (limes and grapefruits) will occupy 2 orchards.\n\nThus, the number of citrus orchards that will be growing grapefruits is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

        "To determine how many citrus orchards will be growing grapefruits, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of orchards for lemons:**\n   The problem states that lemons will take up eight orchards.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of orchards for oranges:**\n   The problem states that oranges will occupy half as many orchards as the lemons.
