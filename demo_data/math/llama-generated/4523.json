Since he started with $50, the total cost of the glasses is:\n\\[ 50 - 1 = 49 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of large glasses Peter bought. Each large glass costs $5, so the cost for \\( x \\) large glasses is:\n\\[ 5x \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThe total cost of all the glasses is the sum of the cost of the small glasses and the cost of the large glasses:\n\\[ 24 + 5x = 49 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ 5x = 49 - 24 \\]\n\\[ 5x = 25 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{25}{5} \\]\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, Peter bought \\(\\boxed{5}\\) large glasses.",

Therefore, the total amount of money he spent is:\n\\[\n50 - 1 = 49\n\\]\nSince he spent $24 on small glasses, the amount of money he spent on large glasses is:\n\\[\n49 - 24 = 25\n\\]\nEach large glass costs $5, so the number of large glasses he bought is:\n\\[\n25 \\div 5 = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of large glasses Peter bought is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
