        "To determine how many fewer pieces of stationery Georgia has than Lorene, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how many pieces of stationery Lorene has.\n2. Calculate the difference between the number of pieces of stationery Lorene has and the number of pieces of stationery Georgia has.\n\nFirst, we know that Georgia has 25 pieces of stationery. Lorene has three times as many pieces of stationery as Georgia. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pieces of stationery Lorene has by multiplying Georgia's number of pieces by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pieces Lorene has} = 3 \\times 25 = 75\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many fewer pieces of stationery Georgia has than Lorene. We do this by subtracting the number of pieces Georgia has from the number of pieces Lorene has:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 75 - 25 = 50\n\\]\n\nSo, Georgia has 50 fewer pieces of stationery than Lorene. The final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]",

Since Lorene has three times as many pieces of stationery as Georgia, we multiply the number of pieces of stationery Georgia has by 3:\n\\[ 25 \\times 3 = 75 \\]\nSo, Lorene has 75 pieces of stationery.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the number of pieces of stationery Lorene has and the number of pieces of stationery Georgia has:\n\\[ 75 - 25 = 50 \\]\nTherefore, Georgia has 50 fewer pieces of stationery than Lorene.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]",
