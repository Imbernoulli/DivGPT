        "To determine the total amount Leon paid, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the toy organizers.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the gaming chairs.\n3.

Add the delivery fee to the subtotal to find the total amount paid.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The cost of the toy organizers is $78 per set, and Leon ordered 3 sets.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 78 = 234\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the toy organizers is $234.\n\n2. The cost of each gaming chair is $83, and Leon ordered 2 gaming chairs.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 83 = 166\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the gaming chairs is $166.\n\n3. Add the total costs of the toy organizers and gaming chairs to find the subtotal.\n   \\[\n   234 + 166 = 400\n   \\]\n   So, the subtotal is $400.\n\n4. The delivery fee is 5% of the subtotal.\n   \\[\n   0.05 \\times 400 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the delivery fee is $20.\n\n5. Add the delivery fee to the subtotal to find the total amount paid.\n   \\[\n   400 + 20 = 420\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount Leon paid is \\(\\boxed{420}\\).",
