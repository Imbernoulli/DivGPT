        "To determine the total cost of the tickets for Julia's family, we need to calculate the cost for each type of ticket and then sum them up. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Identify the number of adult tickets and the number of children's tickets.\n   - Julia's mom, dad, and grandma are adults. So, there are 3 adult tickets.\n   - Julia's three little sisters are children. So, there are 3 children's tickets.\n\n2. Calculate the total cost for the adult tickets.\n   - Each adult ticket costs $12.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the adult tickets is \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\) dollars.\n\n3. Calculate the total cost for the children's tickets.\n   - Each children's ticket costs $10.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for the children's tickets is \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\) dollars.\n\n4. Add the total cost of the adult tickets and the total cost of the children's tickets to get the overall total cost.\n   - The overall total cost is \\(36 + 30 = 66\\) dollars.\n\nSo, the total cost for their tickets is \\(\\boxed{66}\\).",
