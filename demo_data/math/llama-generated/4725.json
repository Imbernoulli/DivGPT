        "To determine how many additional hours it would take for the train to travel an additional 240 miles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the train's speed:**\n   - The train travels 360 miles in 3 hours.\n   - Speed is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the given values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Speed} = \\frac{360 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ hours}} = 120 \\text{ miles per hour}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the time to travel the additional 240 miles:**\n   - We know the speed of the train is 120 miles per hour.\n   - We need to find the time it takes to travel 240 miles.\n   - Time is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the given values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{240 \\text{ miles}}{120 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, it would take the train \\boxed{2} additional hours to travel an additional 240 miles.",
