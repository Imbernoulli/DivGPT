        "To determine how many posters Cassidy currently has, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.\n\nLet's denote the current number of posters Cassidy has as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, after this summer, she will have six more posters. Therefore, the number of posters she will have after this summer is \\( x + 6 \\).\n\nWe are also given that after this summer, the number of posters she will have is double the number of posters she had two years ago. Two years ago, she had 14 posters. So, the number of posters she will have after this summer is also equal to \\( 2 \\times 14 = 28 \\).\n\nWe can now set up the following equation to represent this situation:\n\\[ x + 6 = 28 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 28 - 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, the current number of posters Cassidy has is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",
