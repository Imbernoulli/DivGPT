        "To determine the total number of books in the library now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of books purchased this year.\n2. Determine the total number of books purchased over the two years.\n3. Add the total number of books purchased to the original number of books in the library.\n\nFirst, we know that the library purchased 50 new books last year. This year, it purchased 3 times as many books as last year.
