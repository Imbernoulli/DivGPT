Therefore, today she sewed:\n\\[ 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\text{ aprons} \\]\n\nAdding these to the aprons she already sewed, the total number of aprons she has sewn so far is:\n\\[ 13 + 39 = 52 \\text{ aprons} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of aprons remaining. The total number of aprons needed is 150, so the number of aprons remaining is:\n\\[ 150 - 52 = 98 \\text{ aprons} \\]\n\nHeather wants to sew half of the remaining aprons tomorrow.
