        "To determine how many students are catching up on homework, we start by calculating the number of students doing silent reading and the number of students playing board games.\n\nFirst, we find the number of students doing silent reading:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students doing silent reading} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 24 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the number of students playing board games:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students playing board games} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 24 = 8\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of students doing silent reading and the number of students playing board games to find out how many students are not catching up on homework:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of students doing silent reading and playing board games} = 12 + 8 = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of students doing silent reading and playing board games from the total number of students to find the number of students catching up on homework:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students catching up on homework} = 24 - 20 = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students catching up on homework is \\boxed{4}.",

        "To determine how many students are catching up on homework, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students doing silent reading.\n2. Calculate the number of students playing board games.\n3. Subtract the sum of the students doing silent reading and playing board games from the total number of students to find out how many are catching up on homework.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The class has 24 students, and half of them are doing silent reading.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students doing silent reading} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n   \\]\n\n2.

A third of the students are playing board games.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students playing board games} = \\frac{24}{3} = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we add the number of students doing silent reading and playing board games to find out how many students are not catching up on homework.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of students doing silent reading and playing board games} = 12 + 8 = 20\n   \\]\n\n4.

        "To determine how many students are catching up on homework, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students doing silent reading.\n2. Calculate the number of students playing board games.\n3. Subtract the sum of the students doing silent reading and playing board games from the total number of students.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of students doing silent reading:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students doing silent reading} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of students playing board games:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students playing board games} = \\frac{24}{3} = 8\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the total number of students doing silent reading and playing board games:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of students doing silent reading and playing board games} = 12 + 8 = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's subtract this total from the total number of students to find out how many students are catching up on homework:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students catching up on homework} = 24 - 20 = 4\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of students catching up on homework is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."
