Solve the equation for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   2x = 4.60 - 4.32\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x = 0.28\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{0.28}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 0.14 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. Convert the additional charge from dollars to cents (since there are 100 cents in a dollar):\n   \\[\n   0.14 \\text{ dollars} = 14 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the additional charge per letter for international shipping is \\(\\boxed{14}\\) cents.",
