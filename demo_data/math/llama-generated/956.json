        "To determine how much more the cow is worth after gaining weight, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the new weight of the cow after it has increased its weight.\n2. Determine the value of the cow at its new weight.\n3. Determine the value of the cow at its original weight.\n4. Find the difference in value between the new weight and the original weight.\n\nFirst, we calculate the new weight of the cow:\n\\[\n\\text{New weight} = 1.5 \\times \\text{Original weight} = 1.5 \\times 400 = 600 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the value of the cow at its new weight:\n\\[\n\\text{Value at new weight} = 600 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$3/\\text{pound} = \\$1800\n\\]\n\nThen, we determine the value of the cow at its original weight:\n\\[\n\\text{Value at original weight} = 400 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$3/\\text{pound} = \\$1200\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference in value between the new weight and the original weight:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference in value} = \\$1800 - \\$1200 = \\$600\n\\]\n\nThus, the cow is worth \\(\\boxed{600}\\) dollars more after gaining the weight.",
        "To determine how much more the cow is worth after gaining weight, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the new weight of the cow:**\n   The cow initially weighs 400 pounds.
