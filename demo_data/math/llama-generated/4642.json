        "To determine how long it will take Farmer Steven and his son Darrel to load 2550 pounds of compost into the truck, we need to calculate their combined scooping rate and then use that rate to find the total time required.\n\nFirst, let's find the combined scooping rate of Steven and Darrel:\n- Steven's scooping rate is 75 pounds per minute.\n- Darrel's scooping rate is 10 pounds per minute.\n\nAdding these rates together gives:\n\\[\n75 \\text{ pounds per minute} + 10 \\text{ pounds per minute} = 85 \\text{ pounds per minute}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how long it will take for them to scoop 2550 pounds of compost at their combined rate. We do this by dividing the total amount of compost by their combined scooping rate:\n\\[\n\\frac{2550 \\text{ pounds}}{85 \\text{ pounds per minute}} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Steven and Darrel \\boxed{30} minutes to load up 2550 pounds of compost into the truck.",
