He ordered a nice appetizer for $8, a delicious ribeye steak for his entrée at $20, had two glasses of nice red wine with dinner for $3 each, and a slice of caramel cheesecake for dessert for $6. He used a voucher for half off the price of his entrée, but he very thoughtfully tipped his waitress a full 20% of what the full cost of his meal would have been without the discount. How much, including the tip, did Arthur spend on dinner?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Since Arthur used a voucher for half off the price of his entrée, the cost of the entrée after the discount is:\n\n\\[\n20 \\div 2 = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the appetizer, the discounted entrée, the cost of the wine, and the cost of the dessert to find the total cost of the meal before the tip:\n\n\\[\n8 + 10 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 30\n\\]\n\nThe total cost of the meal before the tip is $30. The tip is 20% of the original total cost of the meal, which is:\n\n\\[\n40 \\times 0.20 = 8\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the tip to the total cost of the meal to find the final amount spent:\n\n\\[\n30 + 8 = 38\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Arthur spent on dinner is \\(\\boxed{38}\\).",
        "To determine the total amount Arthur spent on dinner, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the meal before the discount:**\n   - Appetizer: $8\n   - Entrée: $20\n   - Wine: \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) dollars\n   - Dessert: $6\n\n   Adding these amounts together:\n   \\[\n   8 + 20 + 6 + 6 = 40 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the discount to the entrée:**\n   - The voucher is for half off the entrée.\n   - Half of $20 is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the meal after the discount:**\n   - Appetizer: $8\n   -˟uang: $10\n   - Wine: $6\n   - Dessert: $6\n\n   Adding these amounts together:\n   \\[\n   8 + 10 + 6 + 6 = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the tip:**\n   - Arthur tipped his waitress 20% of the full cost of the meal without the discount.\n   - 20% of $40 is:\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 40 = 8 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total amount spent, including the tip:**\n   - Total cost after discount: $30\n   - Tip: $8\n\n   Adding these amounts together:\n   \\[\n   30 + 8 = 38 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Arthur spent on dinner is \\(\\boxed{38}\\)."
