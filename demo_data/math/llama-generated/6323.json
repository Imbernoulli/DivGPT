        "To determine how many push-ups Miriam does on Friday, we need to calculate the number of push-ups she does each day and then sum up the total for the first four days to find out how many she does on Friday. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Monday**: Miriam does 5 push-ups.\n2. **Tuesday**: Miriam does 7 push-ups.\n3. **Wednesday**: Miriam does twice as many push-ups as she did on Tuesday. So, she does \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\) push-ups.\n4. **Thursday**: Miriam does half the number of total push-ups she already did that week. First, we need to find the total number of push-ups done from Monday to Wednesday. That is \\(5 + 7 + 14 = 26\\). Therefore, on Thursday she does \\(\\frac{26}{2} = 13\\) push-ups.\n5. **Friday**: Miriam does as many push-ups as the total number she did over the previous four days. First, we need to find the total number of push-ups done from Monday to Thursday. That is \\(5 + 7 + 14 + 13 = 39\\). Therefore, on Friday she does 39 push-ups.\n\nSo, the number of push-ups Miriam does on Friday is \\(\\boxed{39}\\).",
