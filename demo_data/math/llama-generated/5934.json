        "To determine the total amount of pet food Mrs. Anderson bought in ounces, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of the cat food.\n2. Calculate the total weight of the dog food.\n3. Convert the total weight from pounds to ounces.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total weight of the cat food:\n- Mrs. Anderson bought 2 bags of cat food.\n- Each bag weighs 3 pounds.\nSo, the total weight of the cat food is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total weight of the dog food:\n- Mrs. Anderson bought 2 bags of dog food.\n- Each bag weighs 2 more pounds than each bag of cat food. Since each bag of cat food weighs 3 pounds, each bag of dog food weighs:\n\\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \\text{ pounds} \\]\nSo, the total weight of the dog food is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total weight of all the pet food:\n\\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nFinally, we need to convert the total weight from pounds to ounces. Since there are 16 ounces in each pound, the total weight in ounces is:\n\\[ 16 \\times 16 = 256 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of pet food Mrs. Anderson bought is \\(\\boxed{256}\\) ounces.",
