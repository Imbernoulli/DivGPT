        "To determine how many milligrams of caffeine Lisa drank over her goal, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of caffeine Lisa consumed by drinking three cups of coffee.\n2. Subtract her daily caffeine goal from the total amount of caffeine consumed.\n3. If the result is positive, it indicates she drank over her goal. If the result is negative or zero, she did not exceed her goal.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1.

Subtract the maximum amount of caffeine Lisa wants to consume in a day from the total amount she consumed.\n   - Lisa's goal is to not exceed 200 mg of caffeine per day.\n   - The total amount of caffeine she consumed is 240 mg.\n   - Therefore, the amount of caffeine she drank over her goal is \\( 240 \\, \\text{mg} - 200 \\, \\text{mg} = 40 \\, \\text{mg} \\).\n\nSo, the amount of caffeine Lisa drank over her goal is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",

        "To determine how many milligrams of caffeine Lisa drank over her goal, we start by calculating the total amount of caffeine she consumes from three cups of coffee. Since each cup of coffee contains 80 mg of caffeine, we can find the total caffeine intake by multiplying the caffeine content per cup by the number of cups she drinks:\n\n\\[ 80 \\, \\text{mg/cup} \\times 3 \\, \\text{cups} = 240 \\, \\text{mg} \\]\n\nNext, we need to compare this total to Lisa's caffeine goal of 200 mg. We subtract her goal from the total caffeine intake to find out how much she drank over her goal:\n\n\\[ 240 \\, \\text{mg} - 200 \\, \\text{mg} = 40 \\, \\text{mg} \\]\n\nTherefore, Lisa drank \\(\\boxed{40}\\) milligrams of caffeine over her goal.",
        "To determine how many milligrams of caffeine Lisa drank over her goal, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of caffeine Lisa consumed from three cups of coffee.\n2. Subtract the maximum amount of caffeine Lisa wants to consume in a day from the total amount she consumed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of caffeine Lisa consumed from three cups of coffee. Since each cup contains 80 mg of caffeine, we multiply the caffeine content of one cup by the number of cups she drank:\n\n\\[ 80 \\, \\text{mg/cup} \\times 3 \\, \\text{cups} = 240 \\, \\text{mg} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the maximum amount of caffeine Lisa wants to consume in a day from the total amount she consumed. Lisa's goal is to not exceed 200 mg of caffeine per day. So, we subtract 200 mg from 240 mg:\n\n\\[ 240 \\, \\text{mg} - 200 \\, \\text{mg} = 40 \\, \\text{mg} \\]\n\nTherefore, Lisa drank \\(\\boxed{40}\\) milligrams of caffeine over her goal.",
