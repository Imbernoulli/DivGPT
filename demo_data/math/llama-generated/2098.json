        "To determine how much too much the three children weigh together to cross the bridge, we need to find the weight of each child and then sum their weights. Finally, we will subtract the bridge's capacity from this total weight.\n\nFirst, we find Megan's weight. We know that Kelly weighs 34 kilograms, which is 15% less than Megan. Let's denote Megan's weight by \\( M \\). Then, we can express Kelly's weight as:\n\\[ 34 = M - 0.15M = 0.85M \\]\nTo find \\( M \\), we solve the equation:\n\\[ M = \\frac{34}{0.85} = 40 \\]\nSo, Megan weighs 40 kilograms.\n\nNext, we find Mike's weight. Mike weighs 5 kilograms more than Megan. Therefore, Mike's weight is:\n\\[ 40 + 5 = 45 \\]\nSo, Mike weighs 45 kilograms.\n\nNow, we sum the weights of Mike, Megan, and Kelly:\n\\[ 45 + 40 + 34 = 119 \\]\nThe total weight of the three children is 119 kilograms.\n\nFinally, we subtract the bridge's capacity from the total weight to find out how much too much they weigh:\n\\[ 119 - 100 = 19 \\]\nSo, the three children weigh \\(\\boxed{19}\\) kilograms too much to cross the bridge.",

Finally, we will compare this total weight to the bridge's capacity of 100 kilograms.\n\nFirst, let's find Megan's weight. We know that Kelly weighs 34 kilograms, which is 15% less than Megan. This means that Kelly's weight is 85% of Megan's weight. Let \\( M \\) be Megan's weight. Then we can write the equation:\n\\[ 34 = 0.85M \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( M \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.85:\n\\[ M = \\frac{34}{0.85} = 40 \\]\n\nSo, Megan weighs 40 kilograms.\n\nNext, we find Mike's weight. Mike weighs 5 kilograms more than Megan. Therefore, Mike's weight is:\n\\[ 40 + 5 = 45 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the weights of Mike, Megan, and Kelly:\n\\[ 45 + 40 + 34 = 119 \\]\n\nThe total weight of the three children is 119 kilograms. The bridge can hold up to 100 kilograms, so the amount that the children weigh too much is:\n\\[ 119 - 100 = 19 \\]\n\nThus, the three children weigh \\(\\boxed{19}\\) kilograms too much to cross the bridge.",
        "To determine how much too much the three children weigh together to cross the bridge, we need to find the weight of each child and then sum their weights.\n\nFirst, let's find Megan's weight. We know that Kelly weighs 34 kilograms, which is 15% less than Megan. Let's denote Megan's weight by \\( M \\). According to the problem, Kelly's weight is \\( M - 0.15M = 0.85M \\).
