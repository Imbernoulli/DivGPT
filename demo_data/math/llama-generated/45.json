        "To determine how much money came out of John's pocket, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories.\n2. Determine the selling price of the PlayStation.\n3. Subtract the selling price of the PlayStation from the total cost of the computer and accessories.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories:\n\\[\n700 + 200 = 900\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the computer and accessories is $900.\n\nNext, let's determine the selling price of the PlayStation. John sold it for 20% less than its value. The value of the PlayStation is $400. To find 20% of $400, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 400 = 80\n\\]\nSo, 20% of $400 is $80. Therefore, the selling price of the PlayStation is:\n\\[\n400 - 80 = 320\n\\]\nSo, John sold the PlayStation for $320.\n\nFinally, we subtract the selling price of the PlayStation from the total cost of the computer and accessories to find out how much money came out of John's pocket:\n\\[\n900 - 320 = 580\n\\]\nSo, the amount of money that came out of John's pocket is \\boxed{580}.",

Subtract the amount he received from selling the PlayStation from the total cost of the computer and accessories.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories.**\n\nThe cost of the computer is $700, and the cost of the accessories is $200. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 700 + 200 = 900 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how much John sold his PlayStation for.**\n\nThe PlayStation was worth $400, but he sold it for 20% less than its value. First, we calculate 20% of $400:\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 400 = 80 \\]\nSo, he sold the PlayStation for:\n\\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the amount he received from selling the PlayStation from the total cost of the computer and accessories.**\n\nThe total cost of the computer and accessories is $900, and he received $320 from selling the PlayStation. Therefore, the amount of money that came out of his pocket is:\n\\[ 900 - 320 = 580 \\]\n\nSo, the amount of money that came out of John's pocket is \\(\\boxed{580}\\).",
