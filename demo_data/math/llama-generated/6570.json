        "To determine the number of girls on the field trip, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of students transported by the five coaster vans.\n2. Subtract the number of boys from the total number of students to find the number of girls.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of students. Since each van carries 28 students and there are 5 vans, we multiply the number of students per van by the number of vans:\n\\[\n28 \\times 5 = 140\n\\]\nSo, the total number of students is 140.\n\nNext, we know that 60 of the students are boys. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:\n\\[\n140 - 60 = 80\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of girls is \\boxed{80}.",
