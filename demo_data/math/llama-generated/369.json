        "To determine the number of ducks at North Pond, we start by defining the number of ducks at Lake Michigan. According to the problem, Lake Michigan has 100 ducks. Let's denote the number of ducks at Lake Michigan as \\( L \\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ L = 100 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many ducks go to North Pond. The problem states that six more than twice as many ducks go to North Pond as go to Lake Michigan. Let's denote the number of ducks at North Pond as \\( N \\). According to the problem, we can express \\( N \\) as:\n\n\\[ N = 2L + 6 \\]\n\nNow, we substitute the value of \\( L \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ N = 2(100) + 6 \\]\n\nWe perform the multiplication first:\n\n\\[ N = 200 + 6 \\]\n\nThen, we add the numbers together:\n\n\\[ N = 206 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ducks at North Pond is \\(\\boxed{206}\\).",
