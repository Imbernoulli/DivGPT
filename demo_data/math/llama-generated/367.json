Since the total number of women polled is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\), the number of women in favor plus the number of women opposed must equal the total number of women polled. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{7x}{40} + 39 = \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fractions, we can multiply every term in the equation by 40:\n\\[\n40 \\cdot \\frac{7x}{40} + 40 \\cdot 39 = 40 \\cdot \\frac{x}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n7x + 1560 = 20x\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting \\( 7x \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n1560 = 13x\n\\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 13:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1560}{13} = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of people Aimee polled is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
