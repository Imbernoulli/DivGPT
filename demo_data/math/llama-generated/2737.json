        "To determine how much Bernie would save in three weeks if he buys his chocolates in the store with the promotion instead of his local store, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of chocolates Bernie spends in three weeks at his local store.\n2. Calculate the total cost of chocolates Bernie spends in three weeks at the store with the promotion.\n3. Find the difference between the two total costs to determine the savings.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of chocolates Bernie spends in three weeks at his local store:\n- Bernie buys 2 chocolates each week.\n- Each chocolate costs $3.\n- Therefore, the cost per week is \\(2 \\text{ chocolates/week} \\times \\$3/\\text{chocolate} = \\$6/\\text{week}\\).\n- Over three weeks, the total cost is \\(3 \\text{ weeks} \\times \\$6/\\text{week} = \\$18\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of chocolates Bernie spends in three weeks at the store with the promotion:\n- Bernie buys 2 chocolates each week.\n- Each chocolate costs $2.\n- Therefore, the cost per week is \\(2 \\text{ chocolates/week} \\times \\$2/\\text{chocolate} = \\$4/\\text{week}\\).\n- Over three weeks, the total cost is \\(3 \\text{ weeks} \\times \\$4/\\text{week} = \\$12\\).\n\nFinally, let's find the difference between the two total costs to determine the savings:\n- The savings is \\(\\$18 - \\$12 = \\$6\\).\n\nThus, Bernie would save \\(\\boxed{6}\\) dollars in three weeks if he buys his chocolates in the store with the promotion instead of his local one.",
