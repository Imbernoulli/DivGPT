        "To determine how much Nancy's ex owes her, we need to calculate the total child support he should have paid over the seven years and then subtract the amount he has already paid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the child support for the first three years. During these years, he made $30,000 per year and was supposed to pay 30% of his income each year.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Child support per year for the first three years} = 0.30 \\times 30,000 = 9,000\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total child support for the first three years} = 9,000 \\times 3 = 27,000\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the child support for the next four years. During these years, he received a 20% raise, so his new income is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New income} = 30,000 + (0.20 \\times 30,000) = 30,000 + 6,000 = 36,000\n\\]\n\n He was supposed to pay 30% of his new income each year.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Child support per year for the next four years} = 0.30 \\times 36,000 = 10,800\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total child support for the next four years} = 10,800 \\times 4 = 43,200\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the total child support for all seven years by adding the amounts for the first three years and the next four years.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total child support for all seven years} = 27,000 + 43,200 = 70,200\n\\]\n\nNancy's ex has only paid $1,200, so the amount he owes her is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount owed} = 70,200 - 1,200 = 69,000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Nancy's ex owes her is \\boxed{69000}."
