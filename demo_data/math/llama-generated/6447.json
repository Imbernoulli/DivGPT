        "To determine the number of children who attended the party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of men.\n2. Calculate the number of women.\n3. Subtract the number of men and women from the total number of attendees to find the number of children.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of men. Since 1/3 of the attendees are men, we multiply the total number of attendees by 1/3:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 120 = 40\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of women. Since half of the attendees are women, we multiply the total number of attendees by 1/2:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of women} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 120 = 60\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of men and women from the total number of attendees to find the number of children:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of children} = 120 - \\text{Number of men} - \\text{Number of women} = 120 - 40 - 60 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of children who attended the party is \\boxed{20}.",
