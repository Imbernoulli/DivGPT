        "To determine the weight left on the truck after the two deliveries, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the weight unloaded at the first store:**\n   - The initial load of the tractor trailer is 50,000 pounds.\n   - 10% of the weight is unloaded at the first store.\n   - \\( 10\\% \\) of 50,000 pounds is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     0.10 \\times 50000 = 5000 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the weight remaining after the first store is:\n     \\[\n     50000 - 5000 = 45000 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the weight unloaded at the second store:**\n   - After the first store, 45,000 pounds remain on the truck.\n   - 20% of the remaining weight is unloaded at the second store.\n   - \\( 20\\% \\) of 45,000 pounds is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     0.20 \\times 45000 = 9000 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the weight remaining after the second store is:\n     \\[\n     45000 - 9000 = 36000 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the weight left on the truck after the two deliveries is \\(\\boxed{36000}\\) pounds.",
