        "Let's denote Jenny's original amount of money by \\( x \\). According to the problem, after spending \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\) of her money, she has $24 left. This means that the remaining money is \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\) of her original amount. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{7} x = 24\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\), which is \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 24 \\times \\frac{7}{4}\n\\]\n\nNow, we perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\nx = 24 \\times \\frac{7}{4} = 6 \\times 7 = 42\n\\]\n\nSo, Jenny's original amount of money is $42.
