To find the cost of 1 kg, we divide the total cost by the number of kilograms:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of 1 kg} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the cost of 5 kg of potatoes. Since we know the cost of 1 kg is $3, we multiply the cost of 1 kg by the number of kilograms Daphney is buying:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of 5 kg} = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Daphney will pay \\boxed{15} dollars.",
        "To determine how much Daphney will pay for 5 kg of potatoes, we start by finding the cost per kilogram of potatoes. We know that 2 kg of potatoes costs $6. Therefore, the cost per kilogram is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per kg} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost for 2 kg}}{\\text{Weight in kg}} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ dollars per kg}\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the cost per kilogram to find the total cost for 5 kg of potatoes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost for 5 kg} = \\text{Cost per kg} \\times \\text{Weight in kg} = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, Daphney will pay \\(\\boxed{15}\\) dollars.",
