        "To determine how much Tom pays for his dance lessons, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of dance lessons Tom actually pays for.\n2. Multiply the number of paid lessons by the cost per lesson.\n\nFirst, we know that Tom decides to take 10 dance lessons, but he gets 2 of them for free. Therefore, the number of lessons he pays for is:\n\\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we know that each dance lesson costs $10.
