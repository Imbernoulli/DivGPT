        "To determine the number of counters and marbles that Reina has, we need to use the information given about Kevin's counters and marbles and the relationships between their quantities.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many counters Reina has. We know that Reina has three times the number of counters as Kevin. Kevin has 40 counters, so we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of counters Reina has} = 3 \\times 40 = 120\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many marbles Reina has. We know that Reina has four times the number of marbles as Kevin. Kevin has 50 marbles, so we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of marbles Reina has} = 4 \\times 50 = 200\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of counters and marbles that Reina has is \\(\\boxed{320}\\).",
