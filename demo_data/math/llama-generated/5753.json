        "To determine how much money Greg earns, we need to calculate the cost for each dog walking session and then sum these costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost for walking one dog for 10 minutes:\n- The base charge per dog is $20.\n- The additional charge per minute per dog is $1.\n- For 10 minutes, the additional charge is \\(10 \\times 1 = 10\\) dollars.\n- Therefore, the total cost for one dog for 10 minutes is \\(20 + 10 = 30\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost for walking two dogs for 7 minutes:\n- The base charge per dog is $20, so for two dogs, the base charge is \\(2 \\times 20 = 40\\) dollars.\n- The additional charge per minute per dog is $1, so for two dogs for 7 minutes, the additional charge is \\(2 \\times 7 \\times 1 = 14\\) dollars.\n- Therefore, the total cost for two dogs for 7 minutes is \\(40 + 14 = 54\\) dollars.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the cost for walking three dogs for 9 minutes:\n- The base charge per dog is $20, so for three dogs, the base charge is \\(3 \\times 20 = 60\\) dollars.\n- The additional charge per minute per dog is $1, so for three dogs for 9 minutes, the additional charge is \\(3 \\times 9 \\times 1 = 27\\) dollars.\n- Therefore, the total cost for three dogs for 9 minutes is \\(60 + 27 = 87\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we sum the costs for all three sessions:\n\\[30 + 54 + 87 = 171\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Greg earns is \\(\\boxed{171}\\) dollars.",
