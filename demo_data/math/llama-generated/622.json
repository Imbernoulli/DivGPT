Therefore, the number of cartons received this week is:\n\\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \\text{ cartons} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of jars received.**\n\nEach carton contains 20 jars. So, the total number of jars received is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 20 = 600 \\text{ jars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of damaged jars.**\n\n- One carton was totally damaged, so the number of jars damaged from this carton is:\n  \\[ 1 \\times 20 = 20 \\text{ jars} \\]\n- In addition, 3 jars were damaged in each of 5 cartons. Therefore, the number of jars damaged from these 5 cartons is:\n  \\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\text{ jars} \\]\n\nThe total number of damaged jars is:\n\\[ 20 + 15 = 35 \\text{ jars} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the number of damaged jars from the total number of jars received to find the number of good jars.**\n\nThe number of good jars is:\n\\[ 600 - 35 = 565 \\text{ jars} \\]\n\nThus, the number of jars of milk that were good for sale that week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{565} \\]",
