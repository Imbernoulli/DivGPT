        "To determine the total time the school nurse will need to complete all the lice checks, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of students the nurse needs to check:\n- Kindergarteners: 26\n- First graders: 19\n- Second graders: 20\n- Third graders: 25\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[ 26 + 19 + 20 + 25 = 90 \\]\n\nNext, we know that each check takes 2 minutes. Therefore, the total time required to check all 90 students is:\n\\[ 90 \\times 2 = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60:\n\\[ 180 \\div 60 = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total time it will take the nurse to complete all the checks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]",

Convert the total time from minutes to hours.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students.**\n\nThe nurse must check:\n- 26 Kindergarteners\n- 19 first graders\n- 20 second graders\n- 25 third graders\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[ 26 + 19 + 20 + 25 = 90 \\]\n\nSo, there are 90 students in total.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total time required to check all the students.**\n\nEach check takes 2 minutes. Therefore, the total time required to check 90 students is:\n\\[ 90 \\times 2 = 180 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.**\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour. To convert 180 minutes to hours, we divide by 60:\n\\[ 180 \\div 60 = 3 \\]\n\nSo, it will take the nurse 3 hours to complete all the checks.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

Determine the total time required for all the checks.\n3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of students to be checked:\n\\[\n26 \\text{ (Kindergarteners)} + 19 \\text{ (first graders)} + 20 \\text{ (second graders)} + 25 \\text{ (third graders)} = 90 \\text{ students}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total time required for all the checks. Since each check takes 2 minutes, we multiply the total number of students by the time per check:\n\\[\n90 \\text{ students} \\times 2 \\text{ minutes/student} = 180 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total time by 60:\n\\[\n180 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take the nurse \\boxed{3} hours to complete all the checks.",
