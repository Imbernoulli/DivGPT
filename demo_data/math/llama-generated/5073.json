        "To determine how much money came out of John's pocket, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount John received for his old stereo system.\n2. Calculate the amount John paid for the new stereo system.\n3. Subtract the amount received from the amount paid to find the net amount out of pocket.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the amount John received for his old stereo system.**\n\nThe original cost of the old stereo system is $250. John received 80% of this value. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.80 \\times 250 = 200\n\\]\nSo, John received $200 for his old stereo system.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the amount John paid for the new stereo system.**\n\nThe original cost of the new stereo system is $600. John received a 25% discount on this price. First, we calculate the discount amount:\n\\[\n0.25 \\times 600 = 150\n\\]\nThen, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price John paid:\n\\[\n600 - 150 = 450\n\\]\nSo, John paid $450 for the new stereo system.\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the amount received from the amount paid to find the net amount out of pocket.**\n\nJohn received $200 and paid $450. The net amount out of pocket is:\n\\[\n450 - 200 = 250\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money that came out of John's pocket is \\boxed{250}.",
        "To determine how much money came out of John's pocket, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount John received for his old stereo system:**\n   - The original cost of the old stereo system was $250.\n   - John received 80% of the value.\n   - To find 80% of $250, we use the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Amount received} = \\text{Original cost} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{Percentage}}{100}\\right)\n     \\]\n     Substituting the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Amount received} = 250 \\times \\left(\\frac{80}{100}\\right) = 250 \\times 0.80 = 200 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the discount on the new stereo system:**\n   - The original cost of the new stereo system is $600.\n   - John received a 25% discount.\n   - To find the discount amount, we use the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Discount amount} = \\text{Original cost} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{Discount percentage}}{100}\\right)\n     \\]\n     Substituting the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Discount amount} = 600 \\times \\left(\\frac{25}{100}\\right) = 600 \\times 0.25 = 150 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the final cost of the new stereo system after the discount:**\n   - The original cost of the new stereo system is $600.\n   - The discount amount is $150.\n   - The final cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Final cost} = \\text{Original cost} - \\text{Discount amount} = 600 - 150 = 450 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine how much money came out of John's pocket:**\n   - John received $200 for his old stereo system.\n   - He spent $450 on the new stereo system.\n   - The net amount out of pocket is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net amount out of pocket} = \\text{Final cost} - \\text{Amount received} = 450 - 200 = 250 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money that came out of John's pocket is \\(\\boxed{250}\\).",
