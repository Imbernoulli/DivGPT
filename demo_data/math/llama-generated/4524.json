        "To determine how many more apples Martha needs to give away to be left with only 4 apples, we start by calculating the total number of apples she has already given away.\n\nFirst, we know that Jane received 5 apples. James received 2 more apples than Jane, so James received:\n\\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of apples given to Jane and James to find the total number of apples given away so far:\n\\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nMartha started with 20 apples. To find out how many apples she has left after giving away 12 apples, we subtract the number of apples given away from the initial number of apples:\n\\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nMartha wants to be left with only 4 apples.

Determine how many more apples Martha needs to give away to be left with only 4 apples.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many apples James received. James got 2 more apples than Jane. Since Jane got 5 apples, James received:\n\\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of apples given away so far. Martha gave 5 apples to Jane and 7 apples to James, so the total number of apples given away is:\n\\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate how many apples Martha has left after giving some away. Martha started with 20 apples and gave away 12 apples, so she has:\n\\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nMartha wants to be left with only 4 apples. Therefore, she needs to give away:\n\\[ 8 - 4 = 4 \\text{ apples} \\]\n\nSo, Martha needs to give away \\(\\boxed{4}\\) more apples to be left with only 4 of them.",
