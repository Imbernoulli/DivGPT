        "To determine how many gallons of gas John uses in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in a week and then divide that by his car's fuel efficiency.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the miles John drives to work each week:\n- John drives 20 miles to work each way.\n- Therefore, he drives \\(20 \\text{ miles} \\times 2\\) miles per day.\n\\[ 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\text{ miles per day} \\]\n- John drives to work 5 days a week.\n\\[ 40 \\text{ miles per day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 200 \\text{ miles per week} \\]\n\nNext, let's add the miles John drives for leisure travel each week:\n- John drives 40 miles for leisure travel each week.\n\\[ 200 \\text{ miles} + 40 \\text{ miles} = 240 \\text{ miles per week} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many gallons of gas John uses to drive 240 miles:\n- John's car gets 30 miles per gallon.\n\\[ \\frac{240 \\text{ miles}}{30 \\text{ miles per gallon}} = 8 \\text{ gallons per week} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of gallons of gas John uses a week is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
        "To determine how many gallons of gas John uses in a week, we need to calculate his total weekly mileage and then divide that by his car's fuel efficiency.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the weekly mileage for John's commute to work. John drives 20 miles each way, so he drives \\(20 \\times 2 = 40\\) miles per day. Since he drives 5 days a week, his total weekly mileage for commuting is:\n\\[40 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 200 \\text{ miles/week}\\]\n\nNext, we add the mileage for leisure travel, which is 40 miles per week. Therefore, John's total weekly mileage is:\n\\[200 \\text{ miles/week} + 40 \\text{ miles/week} = 240 \\text{ miles/week}\\]\n\nSince John's car gets 30 miles per gallon, the number of gallons of gas he uses in a week is:\n\\[240 \\text{ miles/week} \\div 30 \\text{ miles/gallon} = 8 \\text{ gallons/week}\\]\n\nThus, the number of gallons of gas John uses a week is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
        "To determine how many gallons of gas John uses in a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total distance John drives to work in a week.\n2. Add the distance John drives for leisure travel to the distance he drives to work.\n3.

John drives 20 miles to work each way, so the round trip distance is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 40 \\text{ miles} \\]\nJohn drives to work 5 days a week, so the total distance he drives to work in a week is:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 200 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, we add the distance John drives for leisure travel to the distance he drives to work.
