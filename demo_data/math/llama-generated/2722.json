        "To determine how many more pairs of shoes Anthony has compared to Jim, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pairs of shoes Anthony has.\n2. Calculate the number of pairs of shoes Jim has.\n3. Find the difference between the number of pairs of shoes Anthony has and the number of pairs of shoes Jim has.\n\nFirst, we know that Scott has 7 pairs of shoes. Anthony has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Scott. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pairs of shoes Anthony has as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\times 7 = 21\n\\]\nSo, Anthony has 21 pairs of shoes.\n\nNext, we know that Jim has 2 less pairs of shoes than Anthony. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pairs of shoes Jim has as follows:\n\\[\n21 - 2 = 19\n\\]\nSo, Jim has 19 pairs of shoes.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how many more pairs of shoes Anthony has compared to Jim. We do this by subtracting the number of pairs of shoes Jim has from the number of pairs of shoes Anthony has:\n\\[\n21 - 19 = 2\n\\]\nSo, Anthony has \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more pairs of shoes than Jim.",
