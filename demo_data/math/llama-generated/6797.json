        "To determine how many pieces of oranges will be sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of oranges on the truck.\n2. Subtract the number of rotten oranges from the total number of oranges to find out how many oranges are good.\n3. Subtract the number of oranges that will be kept for making orange juice from the number of good oranges to find out how many oranges will be sold.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1.
