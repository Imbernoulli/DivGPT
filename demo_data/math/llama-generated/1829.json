Therefore, the area \\( A_{\\text{forest}} \\) of the forest is:\n\\[ A_{\\text{forest}} = 3 \\times A_{\\text{street}} \\]\n\\[ A_{\\text{forest}} = 3 \\times 10000 \\, \\text{square meters} = 30000 \\, \\text{square meters} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees in the forest.**\n\nThe number of trees per square meter in the forest is 4. Therefore, the total number of trees \\( N \\) in the forest is:\n\\[ N = A_{\\text{forest}} \\times \\text{number of trees per square meter} \\]\n\\[ N = 30000 \\, \\text{square meters} \\times 4 \\, \\text{trees per square meter} = 120000 \\, \\text{trees} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of trees in the forest is \\(\\boxed{120000}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of trees in the forest, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the area of the street.\n2. Use the area of the street to find the area of the forest.\n3. Calculate the total number of trees in the forest based on the area and the number of trees per square meter.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the street. The street is square-shaped with a side length of 100 meters. The area \\( A_{\\text{street}} \\) of a square is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{street}} = \\text{side length}^2\n\\]\nSubstituting the given side length:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{street}} = 100^2 = 10000 \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that the area of the forest is three times the area of the street. Therefore, the area \\( A_{\\text{forest}} \\) of the forest is:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{forest}} = 3 \\times A_{\\text{street}} = 3 \\times 10000 = 30000 \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\nThe number of trees per square meter in the forest is given as 4. To find the total number of trees in the forest, we multiply the area of the forest by the number of trees per square meter:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of trees} = A_{\\text{forest}} \\times \\text{number of trees per square meter} = 30000 \\times 4 = 120000\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of trees in the forest is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{120000}\n\\]"
