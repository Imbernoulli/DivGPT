Subtract the total cost of the items from the remaining money after the investment.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Tabitha starts with $25.\n2. She gives her mom $8:\n   \\[\n   25 - 8 = 17\n   \\]\n   So, she has $17 left after giving her mom $8.\n3. She invests half of the remaining money in a money market:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{17}{2} = 8.5\n   \\]\n   So, she invests $8.50, and the amount of money left after the investment is:\n   \\[\n   17 - 8.5 = 8.5\n   \\]\n4. She spends some money on 5 items that cost $0.50 each:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 0.50 = 2.50\n   \\]\n   So, she spends $2.50 on the items.\n5. Subtract the total cost of the items from the remaining money after the investment:\n   \\[\n   8.5 - 2.5 = 6\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Tabitha has left is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."
