        "To determine how many more tails than heads the solver got, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tails.\n2. Subtract the number of heads from the number of tails to find the difference.\n\nFirst, we know the total number of coin flips is 211. The number of heads is given as 65.
