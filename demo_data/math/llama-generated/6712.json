Subtract the total number of stickers given away from the original number of stickers.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Colton gave 4 stickers each to 3 friends:\n\\[ 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\]\nSo, Colton gave away 12 stickers to his three friends.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many stickers Colton gave to Mandy. He gave Mandy 2 more stickers than he gave his three friends total:\n\\[ 12 + 2 = 14 \\]\nSo, Colton gave 14 stickers to Mandy.\n\nThen, we need to find out how many stickers Colton gave to Justin. He gave Justin 10 less stickers than he gave Mandy:\n\\[ 14 - 10 = 4 \\]\nSo, Colton gave 4 stickers to Justin.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of stickers Colton gave away:\n\\[ 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \\]\nSo, Colton gave away a total of 30 stickers.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of stickers given away from the original number of stickers:\n\\[ 72 - 30 = 42 \\]\nSo, Colton has \\(\\boxed{42}\\) stickers left.",
        "To determine how many stickers Colton has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of stickers Colton gave to his three friends.\n2. Determine how many stickers Colton gave to Mandy.\n3. Determine how many stickers Colton gave to Justin.\n4. Subtract the total number of stickers given away from the initial number of stickers Colton had.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of stickers Colton gave to his three friends:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ stickers/friend} \\times 3 \\text{ friends} = 12 \\text{ stickers} \\]\n\nNext, let's determine how many stickers Colton gave to Mandy. Mandy received 2 more stickers than the total given to the three friends:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ stickers} + 2 \\text{ stickers} = 14 \\text{ stickers} \\]\n\nThen, let's determine how many stickers Colton gave to Justin.
