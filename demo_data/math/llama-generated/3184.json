        "To determine how much shorter Lucille's house is than the average height of the houses, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the heights of all the houses:**\n   - Lucille's house: 80 feet\n   - First neighbor's house: 70 feet\n   - Second neighbor's house: 99 feet\n\n2. **Calculate the sum of the heights:**\n   \\[\n   80 + 70 + 99\n   \\]\n\n   Let's add these step by step:\n   \\[\n   80 + 70 = 150\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   150 + 99 = 249\n   \\]\n\n   So, the total sum of the heights is 249 feet.\n\n3. **Determine the number of houses:**\n   There are 3 houses in total ( Lucille's house and her two neighbors).\n\n4. **Calculate the average height of the houses:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average height} = \\frac{\\text{Total sum of the heights}}{\\text{Number of houses}} = \\frac{249}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   Perform the division:\n   \\[\n   249 \\div 3 = 83\n   \\]\n\n   So, the average height of the houses is 83 feet.\n\n5. **Find out how much shorter Lucille's house is than the average height:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{Average height} - \\text{Height of Lucille's house} = 83 - 80\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate the difference:\n   \\[\n   83 - 80 = 3\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Lucille's house is \\(\\boxed{3}\\) feet shorter than the average height.",
        "To determine how much shorter Lucille's house is than the average height of the houses, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the heights of all the houses.\n2. Calculate the average height of the houses.\n3. Determine the difference between Lucille's house height and the average height.\n\nFirst, let's list the heights of all the houses:\n- Lucille's house: 80 feet\n- Neighbor 1's house: 70 feet\n- Neighbor 2's house: 99 feet\n\nNext, we calculate the average height of the houses. The average is found by adding all the heights together and then dividing by the number of houses. There are 3 houses in total.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total height} = 80 + 70 + 99 = 249 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average height} = \\frac{249}{3} = 83 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much shorter Lucille's house is than the average height. We do this by subtracting the height of Lucille's house from the average height.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 83 - 80 = 3 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Lucille's house is \\boxed{3} feet shorter than the average height."
