Therefore, the total cost for the large tubs is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 6 = 18 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost of the large tubs from the overall total cost to find the total cost of the small tubs. The overall total cost for all the tubs is $48. So, the total cost for the small tubs is:\n\\[\n48 - 18 = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nAlison bought 6 small tubs, and we need to find the cost of each small tub.
