Betty picked 15 oranges and Bill picked 12 oranges. Frank picked three times the number that Betty and Bill picked combined. Frank then planted 2 seeds from each of his oranges into the ground and waited 20 years for each seed to turn into a beautiful orange tree. If each orange tree contains 5 oranges for Frank's son Philip to pick, how many oranges are there for Philip to pick in total?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Each orange tree contains 5 oranges, so the total number of oranges on the orange trees is:\n\\[ 162 \\times 5 = 810 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of oranges Philip can pick is:\n\\[ \\boxed{810} \\]",
