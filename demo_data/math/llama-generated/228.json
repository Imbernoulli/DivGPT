        "To determine how much Maddie's mom spends on coffee each week, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee beans and the cost of the milk she uses.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of coffee beans used per week:\n- Maddie makes herself 2 cups of coffee per day.\n- Each cup uses 1.5 ounces of coffee beans.\n- Therefore, the amount of coffee beans used per day is \\(2 \\times 1.5 = 3\\) ounces.\n- Since there are 7 days in a week, the amount of coffee beans used per week is \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) ounces.\n\nNext, let's determine the cost of the coffee beans used per week:\n- A bag of coffee costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces of beans.\n- To find out how many bags of coffee are needed per week, we divide the total amount of coffee beans used per week by the amount of beans per bag: \\(\\frac{21}{10.5} = 2\\) bags.\n- Therefore, the cost of the coffee beans per week is \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) dollars.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the milk used per week:\n- Maddie uses 1/2 a gallon of milk per week.\n- A gallon of milk costs $4.\n- Therefore, the cost of the milk per week is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = 2\\) dollars.\n\nFinally, let's add the cost of the coffee beans and the cost of the milk to find the total amount spent on coffee per week:\n- The total cost per week is \\(16 + 2 = 18\\) dollars.\n\nThus, Maddie's mom spends \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars on her coffee each week.",

Each bag contains 10.5 ounces of beans, so the number of bags needed is:\n\\[ \\frac{21 \\text{ ounces}}{10.5 \\text{ ounces/bag}} = 2 \\text{ bags} \\]\nSince each bag costs $8, the cost of the coffee beans per week is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ bags} \\times 8 \\text{ dollars/bag} = 16 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the milk. Maddie's mom uses 1/2 a gallon of milk per week, and a gallon of milk costs $4. Therefore, the cost of the milk per week is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ gallon} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars/gallon} = 2 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nFinally, we add the cost of the coffee beans and the cost of the milk to find the total weekly cost of the coffee:\n\\[ 16 \\text{ dollars} + 2 \\text{ dollars} = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\]\nThus, Maddie's mom spends \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars on her coffee each week.",
