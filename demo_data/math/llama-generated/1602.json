Therefore, the number of pages she needs to read each day is:\n   \\[\n   295 \\div 5 = 59\n   \\]\n\nSo, Bekah needs to read \\boxed{59} pages each day for the next 5 days to complete her assignment.",
        "To determine how many pages Bekah needs to read each day for the next 5 days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pages Bekah has left after reading over the weekend.\n2. Divide the remaining pages by the number of days left.\n\nFirst, we find out how many pages Bekah has left after reading 113 pages over the weekend:\n\\[ 408 - 113 = 295 \\]\nSo, Bekah has 295 pages left to read.\n\nNext, we need to divide the remaining 295 pages by the 5 days she has left:\n\\[ 295 \\div 5 = 59 \\]\nTherefore, Bekah needs to read \\(\\boxed{59}\\) pages each day for the next 5 days to complete her assignment.",
