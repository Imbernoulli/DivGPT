        "To determine the total amount of money Mr. Sergio earned from selling the fruits in the season, we need to calculate the total produce of each type of fruit and then find the total revenue.\n\nFirst, let's find the total produce of each type of fruit:\n\n1. **Mangoes**: The farm produced 400 kg of mangoes.\n\n2. **Apples**: The total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes. Therefore, the total produce of apples is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 400 \\text{ kg} = 800 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Oranges**: The total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes. Therefore, the total produce of oranges is:\n   \\[\n   400 \\text{ kg} + 200 \\text{ kg} = 600 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total produce of all the fruits combined:\n\\[\n400 \\text{ kg} \\text{ (mangoes)} + 800 \\text{ kg} \\text{ (apples)} + 600 \\text{ kg} \\text{ (oranges)} = 1800 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nMr. Sergio sold the fruits at $50 per kg. Therefore, the total amount of money he earned is:\n\\[\n1800 \\text{ kg} \\times 50 \\text{ dollars/kg} = 90000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Mr. Sergio got in that season is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{90000}\n\\]",

Therefore, the total amount of money he got is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount of money} = 1800 \\text{ kg} \\times 50 \\text{ dollars/kg} = 90000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Mr. Sergio got in that season is \\(\\boxed{90000}\\).",
