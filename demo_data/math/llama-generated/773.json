        "To determine how much money John has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money John earns from walking the dog.\n2. Subtract the amount of money John spends on books.\n3. Subtract the amount of money John gives to Kaylee.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money John earns from walking the dog. April has 30 days, and John does not walk the dog on Sundays. Since there are 4 Sundays in April, he walks the dog for \\(30 - 4 = 26\\) days. Since he earns $10 for each day he walks the dog, his total earnings are:\n\\[26 \\times 10 = 260 \\text{ dollars}\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount of money John spends on books. He spends $50 on books, so:\n\\[260 - 50 = 210 \\text{ dollars}\\]\n\nThen, we subtract the amount of money John gives to Kaylee. He gives Kaylee $50, so:\n\\[210 - 50 = 160 \\text{ dollars}\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money John has left is:\n\\[\\boxed{160}\\]",
