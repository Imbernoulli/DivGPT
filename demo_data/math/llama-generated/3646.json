        "To determine the government's profit from the stimulus project, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of people who receive the stimulus:**\n   The city has 1000 people, and the bottom 20% of people receive the stimulus.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of people receiving the stimulus} = 1000 \\times 0.20 = 200\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the stimulus:**\n   Each person receives $2000, so the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 200 \\times 2000 = 400,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total return to the government:**\n   The stimulus returns 5 times as much money to the government in terms of tax revenue. Therefore, the total return is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total return} = 400,000 \\times 5 = 2,000,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the government's profit:**\n   Profit is the total return minus the total cost:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Government profit} = 2,000,000 - 400,000 = 1,600,000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the government's profit from this project is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1600000}\n\\]",

        "To determine the government profit from the stimulus project, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of people who received the stimulus.\n2. Determine the total cost of the stimulus.\n3. Calculate the total tax revenue generated from the stimulus.\n4. Find the government profit by subtracting the total cost from the total tax revenue.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of people who received the stimulus.**\n\nThe city has 1000 people, and the bottom 20% of the population receives the stimulus.\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 1000 = 200\n\\]\nSo, 200 people received the stimulus.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total cost of the stimulus.**\n\nEach person who received the stimulus gets $2000. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[\n200 \\times 2000 = 400000\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the stimulus is $400,000.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total tax revenue generated from the stimulus.**\n\nThe stimulus returns 5 times as much money to the government in terms of tax revenue as it cost. Therefore, the total tax revenue is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 400000 = 2000000\n\\]\nSo, the total tax revenue generated is $2,000,000.\n\n**Step 4: Find the government profit.**\n\nThe government profit is the total tax revenue minus the total cost:\n\\[\n2000000 - 400000 = 1600000\n\\]\nSo, the government profit from the project is \\(\\boxed{1600000}\\).",
