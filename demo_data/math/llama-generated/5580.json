        "To determine the total amount of money spent by Dorothy, Julia, and Robert on pens, we start by finding out how many pens each person bought.\n\nFirst, we know that Robert bought 4 pens. Since Julia buys three times as many pens as Robert, we calculate the number of pens Julia bought as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pens Julia bought} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\n\\]\nNext, we know that Dorothy buys half as many pens as Julia. Therefore, we calculate the number of pens Dorothy bought as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pens Dorothy bought} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\nNow, we add up the total number of pens bought by all three friends:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of pens} = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22\n\\]\nSince each pen costs $1.50, the total amount of money spent on pens is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 22 \\times 1.50 = 33\n\\]\nThus, the total amount of money spent by the three friends on pens is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{33}\n\\]",

So, the number of pens Julia buys, which we can denote as \\( J \\), is:\n\\[ J = 3 \\times R = 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Dorothy buys half as many pens as Julia. So, the number of pens Dorothy buys, which we can denote as \\( D \\), is:\n\\[ D = \\frac{1}{2} \\times J = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the cost of the pens for each person.

Since Julia buys three times as many pens as Robert, we can calculate the number of pens Julia buys as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pens Julia buys} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of pens Robert buys} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\n\\]\nDorothy buys half as many pens as Julia, so we can calculate the number of pens Dorothy buys as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pens Dorothy buys} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Number of pens Julia buys} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of pens for each person. Since each pen costs $1.50, we can find the cost for each person by multiplying the number of pens they buy by the cost per pen.\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of pens for Robert} = 4 \\times 1.50 = 6\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of pens for Julia} = 12 \\times 1.50 = 18\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of pens for Dorothy} = 6 \\times 1.50 = 9\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the costs to find the total amount spent on pens:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of pens for Robert} + \\text{Cost of pens for Julia} + \\text{Cost of pens for Dorothy} = 6 + 18 + 9 = 33\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money spent by the three friends on pens is \\(\\boxed{33}\\).",
