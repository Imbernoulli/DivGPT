        "To determine how many pounds of butter Valerie will need to make 4 dozen cookies, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the ratio of cookies to butter:**\n   The original recipe makes 16 dozen cookies and requires 4 pounds of butter. Therefore, the ratio of cookies to butter is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{16 \\text{ dozen cookies}}{4 \\text{ pounds of butter}} = 4 \\text{ dozen cookies per pound of butter}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen cookies:**\n   Since Valerie wants to make 4 dozen cookies, we need to find out how many pounds of butter are required for this amount. Using the ratio we found:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4 \\text{ dozen cookies}}{4 \\text{ dozen cookies per pound of butter}} = 1 \\text{ pound of butter}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Valerie will need \\boxed{1} pound of butter to make 4 dozen cookies.",
