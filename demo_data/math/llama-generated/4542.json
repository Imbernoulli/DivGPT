        "To determine the total number of yellow picks in Johnny's collection, we start by finding the total number of guitar picks. We know that one-third of the picks are blue, and Johnny has 12 blue picks. Let's denote the total number of picks by \\( x \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}x = 12\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[\nx = 12 \\times 3 = 36\n\\]\n\nSo, Johnny has a total of 36 guitar picks. Next, we need to find out how many red picks he has. Since half of the picks are red, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red picks} = \\frac{1}{2}x = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 36 = 18\n\\]\n\nWe already know that Johnny has 12 blue picks. To find the number of yellow picks, we subtract the number of red and blue picks from the total number of picks:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of yellow picks} = x - \\text{Number of red picks} - \\text{Number of blue picks} = 36 - 18 - 12 = 6\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of yellow picks in Johnny's collection is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
