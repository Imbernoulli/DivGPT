        "To determine how much less it is raining this year compared to the average, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total rainfall for the first three days of May this year.\n2. Determine the average rainfall for the first three days of May in a normal year.\n3. Compare the total rainfall this year to the total average rainfall for a normal year.\n4. Find the difference between the total average rainfall and the total rainfall this year.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total rainfall for the first three days of May this year.**\n\n- On the first day, 26 cm of rain fell.\n- On the second day, 34 cm of rain fell.\n- On the third day, 12 cm less than the second day fell. Therefore, the rainfall on the third day is \\(34 - 12 = 22\\) cm.\n\nNow, add the rainfall for all three days:\n\\[26 + 34 + 22 = 82 \\text{ cm}\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the average rainfall for the first three days of May in a normal year.**\n\nThe average rainfall for the first three days of May in a normal year is 140 cm across all three days. Therefore, the total average rainfall for the first three days is:\n\\[140 \\text{ cm}\\]\n\n**Step 3: Compare the total rainfall this year to the total average rainfall for a normal year.**\n\nTo find out how much less it is raining this year compared to a normal year, subtract the total rainfall this year from the total average rainfall:\n\\[140 - 82 = 58 \\text{ cm}\\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the difference between the total average rainfall and the total rainfall this year.**\n\nThe difference is 58 cm.\n\nTherefore, it is raining \\(\\boxed{58}\\) cm less this year than average.",

Find the difference between the two totals.\n\nLet's start with the rainfall for each day:\n- On the first day, 26 cm of rain fell.\n- On the second day, 34 cm of rain fell.\n- On the third day, 12 cm less than the second day fell, which is \\(34 - 12 = 22\\) cm.\n\nNext, we find the total rainfall for the first three days this year:\n\\[26 + 34 + 22 = 82 \\text{ cm}\\]\n\nThe average rainfall for the first three days of May in a normal year is 140 cm across all three days. Therefore, the total average rainfall for these three days in a normal year is:\n\\[140 \\text{ cm}\\]\n\nNow, we compare the total rainfall this year with the total average rainfall for a normal year:\n\\[140 - 82 = 58 \\text{ cm}\\]\n\nSo, it is raining \\(\\boxed{58}\\) cm less this year than average.",
