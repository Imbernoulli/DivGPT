        "To determine Nancy's weight, we start by noting that Nancy drinks 60% of her body weight in water daily. Let's denote Nancy's weight by \\( w \\) pounds. According to the problem, Nancy's daily water intake is 54 pounds. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 0.6w = 54 \\]\n\nTo find \\( w \\), we need to solve for \\( w \\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.6:\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{54}{0.6} \\]\n\nNext, we perform the division:\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{54}{0.6} = \\frac{54 \\times 10}{0.6 \\times 10} = \\frac{540}{6} = 90 \\]\n\nThus, Nancy weighs \\(\\boxed{90}\\) pounds.",

The equation that represents the relationship between her body weight and her daily water intake is:\n\\[ 0.60x = 54 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve for \\( x \\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.60:\n\\[ x = \\frac{54}{0.60} \\]\n\nNext, we perform the division:\n\\[ x = 90 \\]\n\nTherefore, Nancy weighs \\(\\boxed{90}\\) pounds.",

        "To determine Nancy's weight, we start by noting that Nancy drinks 60% of her body weight in water daily. Let's denote Nancy's weight by \\( w \\) pounds.\n\nAccording to the problem, Nancy's daily water intake is 54 pounds. This means that 60% of her body weight is equal to 54 pounds. We can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\\[ 0.60w = 54 \\]\n\nTo find \\( w \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.60:\n\\[ w = \\frac{54}{0.60} \\]\n\nNext, we perform the division:\n\\[ w = \\frac{54}{0.60} = \\frac{54}{\\frac{60}{100}} = \\frac{54 \\times 100}{60} = \\frac{5400}{60} = 90 \\]\n\nThus, Nancy weighs \\(\\boxed{90}\\) pounds.",
