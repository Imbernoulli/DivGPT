        "To determine how much Samantha spends on the dog toys, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of one toy.\n2. Determine the discount structure.\n3. Calculate the total cost for the 4 toys.\n\nFirst, let's identify the cost of one toy:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of one toy} = \\$12.00 \\]\n\nNext, we need to understand the discount structure. The toys are \"buy one get one half off\". This means for every two toys, Samantha pays full price for one toy and half price for the other toy.\n\nLet's calculate the cost for two toys:\n\\[ \\text{Cost for two toys} = \\$12.00 + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\$12.00 \\right) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Cost for two toys} = \\$12.00 + \\$6.00 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Cost for two toys} = \\$18.00 \\]\n\nSince Samantha buys 4 toys, we can consider this as two sets of two toys each. Therefore, we need to calculate the total cost for four toys:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost for four toys} = 2 \\times \\text{Cost for two toys} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total cost for four toys} = 2 \\times \\$18.00 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total cost for four toys} = \\$36.00 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Samantha spends on dog toys is:\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]",
        "To determine how much Samantha spends on dog toys, we need to consider the \"buy one get one half off\" deal and the cost of each toy.

Since each pair consists of 2 toys, the number of pairs is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total cost for all pairs**: Since each pair costs $18.00 and there are 2 pairs, the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 18.00 = 36.00\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Samantha spends on dog toys is \\(\\boxed{36.00}\\).",
        "To determine how much Samantha spends on dog toys, we start by noting the \"buy one get one half off\" deal and the cost of each toy, which is $12.00. Since she buys 4 toys, we can group them into pairs where each pair consists of one toy at full price and one toy at half price.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of one pair of toys:\n- The cost of one toy at full price is $12.00.\n- The cost of one toy at half price is $12.00 / 2 = $6.00.\n- Therefore, the total cost of one pair of toys is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.\n\nSince Samantha buys 4 toys, we have 2 pairs of toys.

        "To determine how much Samantha spends on dog toys, we need to consider the discount operation \"buy one get one half off\" and the cost of each toy, which is $12.00.

The total cost for 2 pairs is:\n- The cost of the first pair is $18.00.\n- The cost of the second pair is $18.00.\n- Therefore, the total cost for 2 pairs of toys is $18.00 + $18.00 = $36.00.\n\nSo, the total amount Samantha spends on dog toys is \\boxed{36}.",

This means for every two toys she buys, she pays the full price for one toy and half the price for the other toy.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost for two toys:\n- The full price of one toy is $12.00.\n- The half price of one toy is $12.00 / 2 = $6.00.\n- Therefore, the total cost for two toys is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.\n\nSince Samantha buys 4 toys, we can break it down into two sets of two toys:\n- The cost for the first set of two toys is $18.00.\n- The cost for the second set of two toys is $18.00.\n\nAdding the costs of both sets together, we get:\n$18.00 + $18.00 = $36.00.\n\nThus, the total amount Samantha spends on dog toys is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
