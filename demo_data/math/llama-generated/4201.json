        "To determine how many more calories than the recommended amount the dietitian ate, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of calories the dietitian consumed during her lunch.\n2. Subtract the recommended calorie intake from the calories consumed to find the excess calories.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of calories the dietitian consumed. She ate three-fourths of her lunch, and the total amount of food she had prepared for lunch was 40 calories. Therefore, the calories consumed are:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 40 = 30 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more calories than the recommended amount she ate. The recommended calorie intake by the FDA is 25 calories. So, we subtract the recommended calorie intake from the calories consumed:\n\\[\n30 - 25 = 5 \\text{ calories}\n\\]\n\nThus, the dietitian ate \\(\\boxed{5}\\) more calories than the recommended amount.",
