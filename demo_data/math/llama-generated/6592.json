Sum up the amounts given to Isha, Florence, and Rene.\n\nFirst, we know that Rene received $300.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much Florence received. According to the problem, Florence received three times as much money as Rene. Therefore, we calculate Florence's amount as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Florence's amount} = 3 \\times \\text{Rene's amount} = 3 \\times 300 = 900\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much Maria gave to Isha. The problem states that Maria gave a third of her money to Isha, and that this amount is half of what she gave to Florence. Therefore, we calculate Isha's amount as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Isha's amount} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Florence's amount} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 900 = 450\n\\]\nSince Maria gave a third of her money to Isha, we can verify that Maria's total money is:\n\\[\n\\text{Maria's total money} = 3 \\times \\text{Isha's amount} = 3 \\times 450 = 1350\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum up the amounts given to Isha, Florence, and Rene:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount given} = \\text{Isha's amount} + \\text{Florence's amount} + \\text{Rene's amount} = 450 + 900 + 300 = 1650\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Maria gave her three friends is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1650}\n\\]",

Therefore, we can calculate the amount Florence received as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount Florence received} = 3 \\times 300 = 900\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Maria gave a third of her money to Isha. Let's denote Maria's total amount of money by \\( x \\). Therefore, the amount Maria gave to Isha is:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount Isha received} = \\frac{x}{3}\n\\]\nThe problem also states that Maria gave half of what she gave to Florence to Isha. So, the amount Maria gave to Isha is also:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount Isha received} = \\frac{900}{2} = 450\n\\]\nSince both expressions represent the amount Maria gave to Isha, we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{3} = 450\n\\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[\nx = 450 \\times 3 = 1350\n\\]\nSo, Maria's total amount of money is $1350. Now, we can calculate how much money Maria gave to Isha, Florence, and Rene:\n\\[\n\\text{Amount Isha received} = 450\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Amount Florence received} = 900\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Amount Rene received} = 300\n\\]\nThe total amount of money Maria gave to her three friends is:\n\\[\n450 + 900 + 300 = 1650\n\\]\nTherefore, the total amount of money Maria gave her three friends is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1650}\n\\]",

Since Isha received $450, we can express this relationship as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{M}{3} = 450\n   \\]\n   To find \\( M \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   M = 450 \\times 3 = 1350\n   \\]\n\n4.
