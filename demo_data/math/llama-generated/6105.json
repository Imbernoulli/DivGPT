        "To determine the total amount of water consumed by the traveler and his camel, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of water the camel drank.\n2. Add the amount of water the traveler drank to the amount the camel drank.\n3. Convert the total amount of water from ounces to gallons.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amount of water the camel drank. The camel drank seven times as much as the traveler, who drank 32 ounces. Therefore, we multiply 32 by 7:\n\\[\n32 \\times 7 = 224 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the amount of water the traveler drank to the amount the camel drank:\n\\[\n32 + 224 = 256 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nNow, we convert the total amount of water from ounces to gallons. Since there are 128 ounces in a gallon, we divide 256 by 128:\n\\[\n256 \\div 128 = 2 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of water they drank altogether is \\boxed{2}.",

Therefore, we calculate the camel's water consumption as follows:\n\\[\n7 \\times 32 = 224 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the amount of water consumed by the traveler and the camel to find the total amount of water consumed:\n\\[\n32 + 224 = 256 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\n\nSince there are 128 ounces in a gallon, we convert the total amount of water from ounces to gallons by dividing by 128:\n\\[\n256 \\div 128 = 2 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of water they drank altogether is \\boxed{2} gallons.",
