        "To determine Bob's total profit, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of the two show dogs:**\n   Bob bought each show dog for $250.00, and he bought 2 show dogs.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 250 = 500\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the show dogs is $500.00.\n\n2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the puppies:**\n   Bob sold each of the 6 puppies for $350.00.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 350 = 2100\n   \\]\n   So, the total revenue from selling the puppies is $2100.00.\n\n3. **Calculate the total profit:**\n   Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.\n   \\[\n   2100 - 500 = 1600\n   \\]\n   So, Bob's total profit is $1600.00.\n\nTherefore, Bob's total profit is \\(\\boxed{1600}\\).",
