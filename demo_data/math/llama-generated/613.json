        "To determine the total cost of the concrete blocks used for the hedge, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of concrete blocks used.\n2. Determine the total cost of the concrete blocks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of concrete blocks used. Each section of the hedge uses 30 pieces of concrete blocks, and there are 8 sections. Therefore, we multiply the number of blocks per section by the number of sections:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ blocks/section} \\times 8 \\text{ sections} = 240 \\text{ blocks} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out the total cost of these 240 concrete blocks. Each block costs $2, so we multiply the total number of blocks by the cost per block:\n\\[ 240 \\text{ blocks} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/block} = 480 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total amount spent on the concrete blocks is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",
