Use Rona's age to find Collete's age.\n4. Calculate the difference between Rachel's age and Collete's age.\n\nGiven that Rona is 8 years old, we can start by finding Rachel's age. Since Rachel is twice as old as Rona, we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Rachel's age} = 2 \\times \\text{Rona's age} = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\n\nNext, we find Collete's age. Since Collete's age is half the age of Rona, we calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Collete's age} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Rona's age} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = 4 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the difference between Rachel's age and Collete's age:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Rachel's age} - \\text{Collete's age} = 16 - 4 = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the difference between the age of Collete and Rachel is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
        "To determine the difference between the age of Collete and Rachel, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Rona's age.\n2. Calculate Rachel's age based on Rona's age.\n3. Calculate Collete's age based on Rona's age.\n4. Find the difference between Rachel's age and Collete's age.\n\nGiven that Rona is 8 years old, we can start with the calculations:\n\n1. Rachel is twice as old as Rona. Therefore, Rachel's age is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 8 = 16\n   \\]\n\n2. Collete's age is half the age of Rona.
