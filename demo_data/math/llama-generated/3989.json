        "To determine how much Micheal will need to pay for 18 hours of piano lessons, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, find out how many lessons Micheal needs to take to get 18 hours of instruction. Since each lesson lasts for 1.5 hours, we can calculate the number of lessons by dividing 18 hours by the duration of each lesson:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of lessons} = \\frac{18 \\text{ hours}}{1.5 \\text{ hours/lesson}}\n   \\]\n   To simplify the division, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2 to eliminate the decimal:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of lessons} = \\frac{18 \\times 2}{1.5 \\times 2} = \\frac{36}{3} = 12\n   \\]\n   So, Micheal needs to take 12 lessons to get 18 hours of instruction.\n\n2. Next, calculate the total cost of 12 lessons. Since each lesson costs $30, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of lessons by the cost per lesson:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 12 \\text{ lessons} \\times 30 \\text{ dollars/lesson} = 360 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Micheal will need to pay \\boxed{360} dollars for 18 hours of lessons.",

        "To determine how much Micheal will need to pay for 18 hours of piano lessons, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the cost per hour for one lesson:**\n   - Each lesson costs $30 and lasts for 1.5 hours.\n   - To find the cost per hour, we divide the total cost by the total hours:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost per hour} = \\frac{30}{1.5}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Perform the division:**\n   - To divide 30 by 1.5, we can convert 1.5 to a fraction:\n     \\[\n     1.5 = \\frac{3}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Now, the division becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{30}{\\frac{3}{2}} = 30 \\times \\frac{2}{3}\n     \\]\n   - Multiply 30 by \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\):\n     \\[\n     30 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 20\n     \\]\n   - So, the cost per hour is $20.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for 18 hours:**\n   - If the cost per hour is $20, then for 18 hours, the total cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost} = 20 \\times 18\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   - Multiply 20 by 18:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 18 = 360\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Micheal will need to pay \\(\\boxed{360}\\) dollars for 18 hours of lessons.",
