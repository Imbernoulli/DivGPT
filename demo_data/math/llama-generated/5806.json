        "To determine how many hours Lisa would need to work to equal Greta's earnings for 40 hours, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Greta's total earnings for 40 hours.\n2. Determine how many hours Lisa needs to work to earn the same amount as Greta.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Greta's total earnings:\n\\[ \\text{Greta's total earnings} = \\text{Greta's hourly wage} \\times \\text{Greta's hours worked} = 12 \\, \\text{dollars/hour} \\times 40 \\, \\text{hours} = 480 \\, \\text{dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours Lisa needs to work to earn $480. Since Lisa earns $15 per hour, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\text{Lisa's total earnings} = \\text{Lisa's hourly wage} \\times \\text{Lisa's hours worked} = 15 \\, \\text{dollars/hour} \\times h \\, \\text{hours} = 480 \\, \\text{dollars} \\]\nwhere \\( h \\) is the number of hours Lisa needs to work.\n\nTo find \\( h \\), we solve the equation for \\( h \\):\n\\[ 15h = 480 \\]\n\\[ h = \\frac{480}{15} = 32 \\]\n\nTherefore, Lisa would need to work \\(\\boxed{32}\\) hours to equal Greta's earnings for 40 hours.",
        "To determine how many hours Lisa would have to work to equal Greta's earnings for 40 hours, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate Greta's total earnings.\n2. Determine how many hours Lisa would need to work to earn the same amount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Greta's total earnings. Greta worked 40 hours and was paid $12 per hour. Therefore, her total earnings are:\n\\[\n40 \\text{ hours} \\times 12 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 480 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours Lisa would have to work to earn $480. Lisa earns $15 per hour. Let's denote the number of hours Lisa works by \\( h \\). The equation we need to solve is:\n\\[\n15h = 480\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( h \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 15:\n\\[\nh = \\frac{480}{15} = 32\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Lisa would have to work \\(\\boxed{32}\\) hours to equal Greta's earnings for 40 hours.",
        "First, we calculate Greta's total earnings for working 40 hours at a rate of $12 per hour. This can be done by multiplying the number of hours she worked by her hourly wage:\n\n\\[\n40 \\text{ hours} \\times 12 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 480 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many hours Lisa would have to work to earn the same amount of money, which is $480. Lisa earns $15 per hour, so we divide her total earnings by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:\n\n\\[\n480 \\text{ dollars} \\div 15 \\text{ dollars/hour} = 32 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Lisa would have to work \\boxed{32} hours to equal Greta's earnings for 40 hours.",
