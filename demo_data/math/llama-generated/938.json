        "To determine how many more gallons of milk Flora needs to drink daily to meet Dr. Juan's requirement, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of gallons of milk Flora will drink if she drinks 3 gallons per day for 3 weeks.\n2. Determine how many more gallons she needs to drink to meet the requirement of 105 gallons.\n3. Find out how many more gallons she needs to drink daily to meet the requirement.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of gallons of milk Flora will drink if she drinks 3 gallons per day for 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there are:\n\\[ 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\text{ days} \\]\nIf she drinks 3 gallons per day, then in 21 days she will drink:\n\\[ 3 \\times 21 = 63 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many more gallons she needs to drink to meet the requirement of 105 gallons. The difference between the required amount and the amount she will drink is:\n\\[ 105 - 63 = 42 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more gallons she needs to drink daily to meet the requirement. Since she has 21 days to drink these 42 gallons, we divide 42 by 21:\n\\[ \\frac{42}{21} = 2 \\text{ gallons per day} \\]\n\nTherefore, Flora needs to drink \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more gallons of milk daily to meet Dr. Juan's requirement.",
        "To determine how many more gallons of milk Flora needs to drink daily to meet Dr. Juan's requirement, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days in 3 weeks.\n2. Determine how many gallons of milk Flora currently plans to drink daily.\n3. Calculate the total number of gallons of milk Flora will drink in 3 weeks based on her current plan.\n4. Find out how many more gallons Flora needs to drink to meet the requirement.\n5. Determine how many more gallons Flora needs to drink daily to meet the requirement.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks there are:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 7 = 21 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n2. Flora plans to drink 3 gallons of milk daily. So, in 21 days she will drink:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 21 = 63 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n3. Dr. Juan requires Flora to drink 105 gallons of milk. Therefore, the number of additional gallons Flora needs to drink is:\n   \\[\n   105 - 63 = 42 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n4. To find out how many more gallons Flora needs to drink daily, we divide the additional gallons required by the number of days:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{42}{21} = 2 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nSo, Flora needs to drink \\(\\boxed{2}\\) more gallons of milk daily to meet Dr. Juan's requirement.",
