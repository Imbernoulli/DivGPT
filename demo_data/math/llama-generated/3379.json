        "To determine how many coins Amalie will remain with after spending \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of her coins on toys, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the ratio of coins between Elsa and Amalie:**\n   The given ratio is \\(10:45\\).

We need to find out how many coins each part represents:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of coins per part} = \\frac{440}{11} = 40\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Elsa has:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 40 = 80 \\text{ coins}\n   \\]\n   And Amalie has:\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 40 = 360 \\text{ coins}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many coins Amalie spends:**\n   Amalie spends \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of her coins on toys. We calculate this amount as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\times 360 = 3 \\times 90 = 270 \\text{ coins}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of coins Amalie remains with:**\n   We subtract the number of coins Amalie spends from the total number of coins she initially has:\n   \\[\n   360 - 270 = 90 \\text{ coins}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of coins Amalie remains with is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).",
