        "To determine how much Maria paid in total after receiving a 25% discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the original price of the DVDs before the discount.\n2. Calculate the discount amount.\n3. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the total amount paid.\n\nFirst, let's denote the original price of the DVDs as \\( P \\). According to the problem, Maria received a 25% discount, which amounts to $40. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the original price \\( P \\):\n\n\\[ 0.25P = 40 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( P \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{40}{0.25} = 160 \\]\n\nSo, the original price of the DVDs was $160. Since Maria received a $40 discount, the total amount she paid is:\n\n\\[ 160 - 40 = 120 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Maria paid is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",

        "To determine how much Maria paid in total after receiving a 25% discount, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the original price of the DVDs before the discount.\n2. Calculate the amount of the discount.\n3. Subtract the discount from the original price to find the total amount paid.\n\nLet's start by finding the original price of the DVDs. We know that the discount is $40 and it represents 25% of the original price. We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship:\n\n\\[ \\text{Discount} = \\text{Original Price} \\times \\frac{25}{100} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given discount into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 40 = \\text{Original Price} \\times 0.25 \\]\n\nTo find the original price, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:\n\n\\[ \\text{Original Price} = \\frac{40}{0.25} \\]\n\nPerforming the division, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Original Price} = 160 \\]\n\nSo, the original price of the DVDs is $160. Now, we need to subtract the discount from the original price to find out how much Maria paid:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Amount Paid} = \\text{Original Price} - \\text{Discount} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Amount Paid} = 160 - 40 \\]\n\nPerforming the subtraction, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Amount Paid} = 120 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Maria paid is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
