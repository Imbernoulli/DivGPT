        "To determine 10 times the average number of letters in both Elida's and Adrianna's names, we start by finding the number of letters in each name.\n\nFirst, we know that Elida has 5 letters. Next, we need to calculate the number of letters in Adrianna's name. According to the problem, Adrianna has 2 less than twice the number of letters Elida has. We can express this as:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \\]\nSo, Adrianna has 8 letters.\n\nNow, we find the total number of letters in both names by adding the number of letters in Elida's name and the number of letters in Adrianna's name:\n\\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the average number of letters in both names by dividing the total number of letters by 2:\n\\[ \\frac{13}{2} = 6.5 \\]\n\nFinally, we find 10 times the average number of letters:\n\\[ 10 \\times 6.5 = 65 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{65} \\]",
