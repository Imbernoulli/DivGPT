        "To determine how long it takes John to row around the square lake, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate John's swimming speed:**\n   - John takes 20 minutes to swim 1 mile.\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - Therefore, the number of miles John swims in 1 hour is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Swimming speed} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{20 \\text{ minutes}} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = 3 \\text{ miles per hour}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine John's rowing speed:**\n   - John can row at twice the speed he can swim.\n   - Therefore, the rowing speed is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Rowing speed} = 2 \\times 3 \\text{ miles per hour} = 6 \\text{ miles per hour}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the perimeter of the square lake:**\n   - Each side of the square lake is 15 miles.\n   - The perimeter of a square is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\times \\text{side length} = 4 \\times 15 \\text{ miles} = 60 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the time it takes to row around the lake:**\n   - The time taken to row a distance is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the time to row 60 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 10 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\nThus, it takes John \\(\\boxed{10}\\) hours to row around the lake.",
        "To determine how long it takes John to row around the square lake, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate John's swimming speed:**\n   John swims 1 mile in 20 minutes. To find his speed in miles per hour, we convert 20 minutes to hours:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{20}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, his swimming speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Swimming speed} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{\\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours}} = 3 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine John's rowing speed:**\n   John can row at twice the speed he can swim. Thus, his rowing speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rowing speed} = 2 \\times 3 \\text{ miles per hour} = 6 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total distance around the lake:**\n   The lake is a square with each side measuring 15 miles.

        "To determine how long it takes John to row around the square lake, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate John's swimming speed:**\n   John takes 20 minutes to swim 1 mile. Therefore, his swimming speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Swimming speed} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{20 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{\\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hour}} = 3 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine John's rowing speed:**\n   John can row at twice the speed he can swim. Thus, his rowing speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rowing speed} = 2 \\times 3 \\text{ miles per hour} = 6 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total distance around the square lake:**\n   Each side of the square lake is 15 miles. Since there are four sides, the total distance is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total distance} = 4 \\times 15 \\text{ miles} = 60 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the time it takes to row the entire distance:**\n   Using the rowing speed, we can find the time it takes to row 60 miles:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time to row} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Rowing speed}} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 10 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes John \\(\\boxed{10}\\) hours to row around the lake.",
