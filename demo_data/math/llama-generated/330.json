Therefore, we calculate the number of pebbles Lance threw as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\times 4 = 12\n\\]\nSo, Lance threw 12 pebbles.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more pebbles Lance threw compared to Candy. We do this by subtracting the number of pebbles Candy threw from the number of pebbles Lance threw:\n\\[\n12 - 4 = 8\n\\]\nThus, Lance threw 8 more pebbles than Candy. The final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many more pebbles Lance threw compared to Candy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of pebbles Candy threw.\n2.
