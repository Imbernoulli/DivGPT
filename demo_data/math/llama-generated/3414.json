        "To determine the total number of dots on all the ladybugs Andre catches, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of ladybugs Andre catches.\n2. Determine the total number of dots by multiplying the total number of ladybugs by the number of dots on each ladybug.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ladybugs Andre catches:\n- Andre catches 8 ladybugs on Monday.\n- Andre catches 5 ladybugs on Tuesday.\n- Therefore, the total number of ladybugs is \\(8 + 5 = 13\\).\n\nNext, we know that each ladybug has 6 dots. To find the total number of dots, we multiply the total number of ladybugs by the number of dots on each ladybug:\n\\[13 \\times 6 = 78\\]\n\nSo, the total number of dots on all the ladybugs is \\(\\boxed{78}\\).",

Andre catches 8 ladybugs on Monday and 5 ladybugs on Tuesday. Therefore, the total number of ladybugs is:\n\\[ 8 + 5 = 13 \\]\n\nNext, we know that each ladybug has 6 dots. So, to find the total number of dots, we multiply the total number of ladybugs by the number of dots each ladybug has:\n\\[ 13 \\times 6 = 78 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of dots on all the ladybugs is \\(\\boxed{78}\\).",
