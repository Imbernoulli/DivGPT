Determine how much money Carl's dad gave him to buy the coat.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Carl saved in the first 6 weeks.\n   Carl saved $25 each week for 6 weeks.\n   \\[\n   25 \\times 6 = 150\n   \\]\n   So, Carl saved $150 in the first 6 weeks.\n\n2. Determine how much money Carl had left after using a third of his savings in the seventh week.\n   Carl used a third of his $150 savings to pay some bills.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{150}{3} = 50\n   \\]\n   So, Carl used $50 to pay bills. Therefore, the amount of money he had left is:\n   \\[\n   150 - 50 = 100\n   \\]\n   So, Carl had $100 left after the seventh week.\n\n3. Calculate how much more money Carl needed to buy the coat after the seventh week.\n   The coat costs $170. Since Carl had $100 left, the amount of money he still needed is:\n   \\[\n   170 - 100 = 70\n   \\]\n   So, Carl needed $70 more to buy the coat.\n\n4. Determine how much money Carl's dad gave him to buy the coat.\n   Carl's dad gave him the remaining $70 needed to buy the coat.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Carl's dad gave him is \\boxed{70}.",
