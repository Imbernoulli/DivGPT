        "First, we need to determine the number of seats in each carriage after it can accommodate 10 more passengers. Initially, each carriage has 25 seats. Therefore, after the increase, each carriage will have:\n\\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \\text{ seats} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of seats in one train. Since there are 4 carriages in each train, the total number of seats in one train is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 35 = 140 \\text{ seats} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many seats are available in 3 trains. Since each train has 140 seats, the total number of seats in 3 trains is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 140 = 420 \\text{ seats} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of passengers that would fill up 3 trains is:\n\\[ \\boxed{420} \\]",

Find the total capacity of 3 trains.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of seats in one carriage:\n\\[ 25 \\text{ seats per carriage} \\]\n\nNext, we determine the total number of seats in one train by multiplying the number of seats per carriage by the number of carriages:\n\\[ 25 \\text{ seats per carriage} \\times 4 \\text{ carriages} = 100 \\text{ seats per train} \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the increased capacity of one train after adding 10 more seats to each carriage:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ seats per train} + 4 \\times 10 \\text{ additional seats} = 100 + 40 = 140 \\text{ seats per train} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the total capacity of 3 trains by multiplying the increased capacity of one train by 3:\n\\[ 140 \\text{ seats per train} \\times 3 \\text{ trains} = 420 \\text{ seats} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of passengers that would fill up 3 trains is:\n\\[ \\boxed{420} \\]",
        "First, let's determine the number of seats in one carriage. Each carriage has 25 seats, and if each carriage could accommodate 10 more passengers, then each carriage would have:\n\n\\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \\text{ seats} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many seats are in one train. Since there are 4 carriages in each train, the total number of seats in one train is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 35 = 140 \\text{ seats} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many seats are in 3 trains. Since each train has 140 seats, the total number of seats in 3 trains is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 140 = 420 \\text{ seats} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of passengers that would fill up 3 trains is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{420} \\]",
