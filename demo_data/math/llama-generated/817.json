        "To determine how long the movie theater operates each day, we need to consider both the length of the movie and the advertisement for each showing. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.

Therefore, the total length of the movies is:\n\\[ 1.5 \\text{ hours/movie} \\times 6 \\text{ movies} = 9 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the advertisements.

We need to convert the length of the advertisements from minutes to hours:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{20}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours} \\]\nSo, the total length of the advertisements is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ advertisements} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hoursouters} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we add the total length of the movies and the total length of the advertisements to find the total operating time of the movie theater each day:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ hours} + 2 \\text{ hours} = 11 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the movie theater operates each day for \\(\\boxed{11}\\) hours.",

The movie itself is 1.5 hours long, and there is a 20-minute advertisement before it starts. We need to convert the advertisement time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 20 minutes is equal to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{60} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSo, the total time for one showing of the movie is:\n\n\\[\n1.5 + \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo add these two times together, we need a common denominator.
