        "To determine how many hours Alani needs to baby-sit to earn $75, we start by finding her hourly wage. We know that Alani earned $45 for 3 hours of baby-sitting. Therefore, her hourly wage is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hourly wage} = \\frac{45}{3} = 15 \\text{ dollars per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many hours she needs to baby-sit to earn $75. Let's denote the number of hours she needs to baby-sit as \\( h \\). Since her hourly wage is $15, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n15h = 75\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( h \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 15:\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{75}{15} = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Alani needs to baby-sit for \\(\\boxed{5}\\) hours to earn $75.",
