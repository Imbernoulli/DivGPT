        "First, let's determine the total value of the dimes and quarters Sam initially has. Sam has 19 dimes, and since each dime is worth 10 cents, the value of the dimes is:\n\\[ 19 \\times 10 = 190 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nSam also has 6 quarters, and since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the value of the quarters is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nAdding the value of the dimes and the value of the quarters gives us the total amount of money Sam has initially:\n\\[ 190 + 150 = 340 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the candy bars and the lollipop. Sam buys 4 candy bars, and each candy bar costs 3 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the cost of one candy bar is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the 4 candy bars is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 30 = 120 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nSam also buys 1 lollipop, and the lollipop costs 1 quarter. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the cost of the lollipop is:\n\\[ 25 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nAdding the cost of the candy bars and the cost of the lollipop gives us the total amount of money Sam spends:\n\\[ 120 + 25 = 145 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nFinally, subtracting the total amount of money Sam spends from the total amount of money she initially has gives us the amount of money Sam has left:\n\\[ 340 - 145 = 195 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Sam has left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{195} \\]",
        "To determine how much money Sam has left after her purchases, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the candy bars.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the lollipop.\n3. Determine the total amount of money Sam spends.\n4. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Sam has.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the candy bars. Sam buys 4 candy bars, and each candy bar costs 3 dimes. Since 1 dime is worth 10 cents, 3 dimes are worth \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\) cents. Therefore, the total cost of the candy bars is:\n\\[4 \\times 30 = 120 \\text{ cents}\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the lollipop. Sam buys 1 lollipop, and it costs 1 quarter. Since 1 quarter is worth 25 cents, the total cost of the lollipop is:\n\\[1 \\times 25 = 25 \\text{ cents}\\]\n\nNow, let's determine the total amount of money Sam spends. Adding the cost of the candy bars and the cost of the lollipop gives:\n\\[120 + 25 = 145 \\text{ cents}\\]\n\nFinally, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Sam has. Sam initially has 19 dimes and 6 quarters. The value of 19 dimes is:\n\\[19 \\times 10 = 190 \\text{ cents}\\]\nThe value of 6 quarters is:\n\\[6 \\times 25 = 150 \\text{ cents}\\]\nTherefore, the initial amount of money Sam has is:\n\\[190 + 150 = 340 \\text{ cents}\\]\nSubtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount gives:\n\\[340 - 145 = 195 \\text{ cents}\\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Sam has left is:\n\\[\\boxed{195}\\]",

Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the cost of one candy bar is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ dimes} \\times 10 \\text{ cents per dime} = 30 \\text{ cents} \\]\nTherefore, the total cost of 4 candy bars is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ candy bars} \\times 30 \\text{ cents per candy bar} = 120 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the lollipop. Sam buys 1 lollipop, and it costs 1 quarter. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the cost of the lollipop is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ quarter} \\times 25 \\text{ cents per quarter} = 25 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNow, let's find out how much money Sam spends in total. The total cost of the candy bars and the lollipop is:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ cents} + 25 \\text{ cents} = 145 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine Sam's initial amount of money. Sam has 19 dimes and 6 quarters.
