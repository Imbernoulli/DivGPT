        "To determine the total number of window screens Bennett sold from January to March, we need to find out how many screens he sold each month and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we know that Bennett sold 8800 window screens in March. Let's denote the number of screens he sold in March as \\( M \\). So, we have:\n\\[ M = 8800 \\]\n\nNext, we are given that in February, Bennett sold a fourth of what he sold in March. Let's denote the number of screens he sold in February as \\( F \\). Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ F = \\frac{M}{4} = \\frac{8800}{4} = 2200 \\]\n\nWe are also given that in February, Bennett sold twice as many screens as he sold in January. Let's denote the number of screens he sold in January as \\( J \\). Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ F = 2J \\]\nSince we already know that \\( F = 2200 \\), we can substitute this value in to find \\( J \\):\n\\[ 2200 = 2J \\]\n\\[ J = \\frac{2200}{2} = 1100 \\]\n\nNow, we have the number of screens sold in each month:\n- January: \\( J = 1100 \\)\n- February: \\( F = 2200 \\)\n- March: \\( M = 8800 \\)\n\nTo find the total number of screens sold from January to March, we sum these amounts:\n\\[ J + F + M = 1100 + 2200 + 8800 = 12100 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of screens Bennett sold from January to March is:\n\\[ \\boxed{12100} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of window screens Bennett sold from January to March, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of window screens sold in February:**\n   - Bennett sold a fourth of what he sold in March.\n   - Given that Bennett sold 8800 window screens in March, we calculate the February sales as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{February sales} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 8800 = 2200\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of window screens sold in January:**\n   - Bennett sold twice as many window screens in February as he sold in January.\n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the number of window screens sold in January.
