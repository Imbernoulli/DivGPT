Determine the number of boxes in the second warehouse based on the information given.\n3. Add the number of boxes in the first warehouse to the number of boxes in the second warehouse.\n\nWe know from the problem statement that the first warehouse has 400 boxes. It is also given that the first warehouse has twice as many boxes as the second warehouse. Let's denote the number of boxes in the second warehouse as \\( x \\). According to the information provided, the number of boxes in the first warehouse is \\( 2x \\). Since the first warehouse has 400 boxes, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 2x = 400 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ x = \\frac{400}{2} = 200 \\]\n\nSo, the second warehouse has 200 boxes. Now, we add the number of boxes in the first warehouse to the number of boxes in the second warehouse to find the total number of boxes in both warehouses:\n\\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of boxes in both warehouses combined is \\(\\boxed{600}\\).",

Let's denote the number of boxes in the second warehouse as \\( x \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 400 = 2x \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ x = \\frac{400}{2} = 200 \\]\n\nSo, the second warehouse has 200 boxes.\n\nNow, we add the number of boxes in the first warehouse to the number of boxes in the second warehouse to find the total number of boxes:\n\\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of boxes in both warehouses combined is \\(\\boxed{600}\\).",

According to the problem, we can write the equation:\n\\[ B_1 = 2B_2 \\]\nWe know that \\( B_1 = 400 \\), so we substitute 400 for \\( B_1 \\) in the equation:\n\\[ 400 = 2B_2 \\]\nTo find \\( B_2 \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ B_2 = \\frac{400}{2} = 200 \\]\nSo, the second warehouse has 200 boxes.\n\nStep 3: Add the number of boxes in both warehouses together.\nNow, we add the number of boxes in the first warehouse and the second warehouse:\n\\[ B_1 + B_2 = 400 + 200 = 600 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of boxes in both warehouses combined is \\(\\boxed{600}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of boxes in both warehouses combined, we start by identifying the number of boxes in each warehouse.\n\n1. We know that the first warehouse has 400 boxes.\n2.
