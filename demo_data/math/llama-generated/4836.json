        "To determine how many pills Mr. Johnson is supposed to take a day, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of days Mr. Johnson has taken pills:**\n   Mr. Johnson's prescription is for 30 days. After four-fifths of the days, he has taken pills for:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{5} \\times 30 = 24 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of pills Mr. Johnson has taken:**\n   Mr. Johnson started with enough pills for 30 days and now has 12 pills left. Therefore, the total number of pills he has taken is:\n   \\[\n   30x - 12\n   \\]\n   where \\( x \\) is the number of pills he takes each day. We also know from the previous step that he has taken pills for 24 days, so the total number of pills he has taken is:\n   \\[\n   24x\n   \\]\n   Setting these two expressions for the total number of pills taken equal to each other, we get:\n   \\[\n   30x - 12 = 24x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   Subtract \\( 24x \\) from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   6x - 12 = 0\n   \\]\n   Add 12 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   6x = 12\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 6:\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mr. Johnson is supposed to take \\(\\boxed{2}\\) pills a day.",

        "To determine how many pills Mr. Johnson is supposed to take each day, we start by calculating the number of days that have passed after four-fifths of the 30 days. This can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of days passed} = \\frac{4}{5} \\times 30 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis means that Mr. Johnson has been taking pills for 24 days.

This means that in the remaining 6 days, he will take all 12 pills. Let \\( p \\) be the number of pills Mr. Johnson takes each day.

Determine the total number of pills Mr. Johnson has taken.\n3. Find out how many pills Mr. Johnson is supposed to take each day.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of days Mr. Johnson has taken pills. Since he has taken pills for four-fifths of the 30 days, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5} \\times 30 = 24 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the total number of pills Mr. Johnson has taken. Since he started with enough pills for 30 days and has 12 pills left after 24 days, we can find out how many pills he has taken by subtracting the number of pills left from the original number of pills. First, we find the original number of pills. Since the pills were enough for 30 days, the original number of pills is:\n\\[\n\\text{Original number of pills} = 30 \\times x\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the number of pills Mr. Johnson is supposed to take each day. After 24 days, he has taken:\n\\[\n24 \\times x \\text{ pills}\n\\]\nand has 12 pills left, so:\n\\[\n\\text{Original number of pills} - 24 \\times x = 12\n\\]\nSince the original number of pills is \\( 30 \\times x \\), we substitute it into the equation:\n\\[\n30x - 24x = 12\n\\]\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\n6x = 12\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 6:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{12}{6} = 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mr. Johnson is supposed to take \\(\\boxed{2}\\) pills each day.",

        "To determine how many pills Mr. Johnson is supposed to take each day, we start by calculating the number of days he has taken pills. The prescription is for 30 days, and after four-fifths of the days, he has 12 pills left. First, we calculate four-fifths of 30 days:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5} \\times 30 = 24 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nThis means Mr. Johnson has taken pills for 24 days. Let \\( p \\) be the number of pills Mr. Johnson takes each day. Therefore, the total number of pills he has taken in 24 days is \\( 24p \\). Since he started with enough pills for 30 days and has 12 pills left after 24 days, the total number of pills he started with is \\( 24p + 12 \\). This total number of pills is also equal to the number of pills he would have taken if he took \\( p \\) pills each day for 30 days, which is \\( 30p \\). So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n30p = 24p + 12\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( p \\), we subtract \\( 24p \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n30p - 24p = 12\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n6p = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 6:\n\n\\[\np = 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mr. Johnson is supposed to take \\(\\boxed{2}\\) pills each day.",

Let's denote the number of pills Mr. Johnson is supposed to take each day by \\( x \\). Therefore, the total number of pills he has taken in 24 days is \\( 24x \\). Since the prescription was for 30 days, the total number of pills in the prescription is \\( 30x \\). After taking pills for 24 days, he has 12 pills left, so the number of pills he has taken is \\( 30x - 12 \\). We can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n24x = 30x - 12\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation by isolating \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n24x - 30x = -12\n\\]\n\\[\n-6x = -12\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-12}{-6}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, Mr. Johnson is supposed to take \\(\\boxed{2}\\) pills a day.",

We know that after taking pills for 24 days, he has 12 pills left. Therefore, the total number of pills he has taken is the total number of pills minus the number of pills he has left. Since the prescription is for 30 days, the total number of pills is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total pills} = 30 \\times \\text{daily dose}\n\\]\nLet \\( x \\) be the daily dose.

        "To determine how many pills Mr. Johnson is supposed to take each day, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of days Mr. Johnson has taken pills.\n2. Determine the total number of pills Mr. Johnson has taken.\n3. Find out the daily dose of pills.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of days Mr. Johnson has taken pills. Since he has taken pills for four-fifths of the 30 days, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5} \\times 30 = 24 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the total number of pills Mr. Johnson has taken. Since he started with enough pills for 30 days and has 12 pills left after 24 days, we can find out how many pills he has taken by subtracting the number of pills left from the initial number of pills. The initial number of pills is:\n\\[\n\\text{Initial number of pills} = \\text{Number of pills taken} + \\text{Number of pills left} = \\text{Number of pills taken} + 12\n\\]\nSince the initial number of pills is enough for 30 days, it is also equal to 30 times the daily dose. Let's denote the daily dose by \\( x \\). Therefore, the initial number of pills is \\( 30x \\).
