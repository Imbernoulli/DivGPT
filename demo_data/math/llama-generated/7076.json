        "Let \\( d \\) represent the number of minutes Dad spent vacuuming downstairs. According to the problem, Dad spent 5 more than twice as long vacuuming upstairs. Therefore, the time he spent vacuuming upstairs can be expressed as \\( 2d + 5 \\).\n\nThe total time spent vacuuming both upstairs and downstairs is given as 38 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:\n\n\\[\nd + (2d + 5) = 38\n\\]\n\nFirst, combine the terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[\nd + 2d + 5 = 38\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\[\n3d + 5 = 38\n\\]\n\nNext, isolate the term with \\( d \\) by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n3d = 38 - 5\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\n3d = 33\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( d \\) by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{33}{3}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nd = 11\n\\]\n\nSo, Dad spent 11 minutes vacuuming downstairs.
