According to the problem, Markus's son is twice the age of Markus's grandson, so the age of Markus's son is \\( 2g \\). Markus is twice the age of his son, so the age of Markus is \\( 2 \\times 2g = 4g \\).\n\nThe sum of the ages of Markus, his son, and his grandson is given as 140 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n4g + 2g + g = 140\n\\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[\n7g = 140\n\\]\nTo find \\( g \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:\n\\[\ng = \\frac{140}{7} = 20\n\\]\nSo, Markus's grandson is \\(\\boxed{20}\\) years old.",
        "To determine the age of Markus's grandson, we start by defining the variables for their ages. Let \\( g \\) represent the age of Markus's grandson. According to the problem, Markus's son is twice the age of his grandson, so we can express the age of Markus's son as \\( 2g \\). Additionally, Markus is twice the age of his son, so we can express Markus's age as \\( 2 \\times 2g = 4g \\).\n\nThe sum of their ages is given as 140 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n4g + 2g + g = 140\n\\]\nCombining the terms on the left side, we get:\n\\[\n7g = 140\n\\]\nTo find the value of \\( g \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:\n\\[\ng = \\frac{140}{7} = 20\n\\]\nThus, Markus's grandson is \\(\\boxed{20}\\) years old.",
