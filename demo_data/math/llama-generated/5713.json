Therefore, the equation representing the total amount of money she had after signifying the shirts is:\n\\[\n30 + 4x - 20 = 30\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n10 + 4x = 30\n\\]\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n\\[\n4x = 20\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, Selina sold \\(\\boxed{5}\\) shirts to the store.",
