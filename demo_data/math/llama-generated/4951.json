        "To determine how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 180 miles at the same rate, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the speed of the train:**\n   The train travels 270 miles in 3 hours. To find the speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{270 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ hours}} = 90 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the time required to travel the additional 180 miles:**\n   Now that we know the speed of the train, we can find out how long it takes to travel 180 miles by dividing the distance by the speed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{180 \\text{ miles}}{90 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it would take an additional \\boxed{2} hours to travel an additional 180 miles.",
