        "To determine how many pounds of pig feed Randy's pigs will be fed per week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all pigs:**\n   - Randy feeds each pig 10 pounds of feed per day.\n   - Randy has 2 pigs.\n   - Therefore, the total daily feed consumption for all pigs is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\text{ pounds/pig/day} \\times 2 \\text{ pigs} = 20 \\text{ pounds/day}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the weekly feed consumption for all pigs:**\n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - The total daily feed consumption is 20 pounds.\n   - Therefore, the total weekly feed consumption is:\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ pounds/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 140 \\text{ pounds/week}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pounds of pig feed Randy's pigs will be fed per week is \\(\\boxed{140}\\).",
        "To determine how many pounds of pig feed Randy's pigs will be fed per week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the daily feed consumption for all the pigs.\n2.

Therefore, the total daily feed consumption is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ pigs} \\times 10 \\text{ pounds per pig per day} = 20 \\text{ pounds per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the weekly feed consumption.\n   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ pounds per day} \\times 7 \\text{ days per week} = 140 \\text{ pounds per week}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of pig feed Randy's pigs will be fed per week is \\(\\boxed{140}\\).",
