        "To determine how many strawberry seeds will remain after Lolita plants them in 7 planting zones, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of seeds used in 7 planting zones.\n2. Subtract the total number of seeds used from the initial number of seeds.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of seeds used in 7 planting zones. Each planting zone uses 3123 seeds, so we multiply 3123 by 7:\n\n\\[\n3123 \\times 7 = 21861\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total number of seeds used from the initial number of seeds.
