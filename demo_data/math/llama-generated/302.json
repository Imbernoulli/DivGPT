        "To determine the total number of books Sarah's brother bought, we need to calculate the number of paperback and hardback books he purchased separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of paperback books Sarah's brother bought. Sarah bought 6 paperback books, and her brother bought one-third as many paperback books as Sarah. Therefore, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of paperback books her brother bought} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of hardback books Sarah's brother bought. Sarah bought 4 hardback books, and her brother bought two times the number of hardback books as Sarah. Therefore, we perform the following calculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of hardback books her brother bought} = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of paperback books and hardback books her brother bought to find the total number of books he purchased:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of books her brother bought} = 2 + 8 = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of books her brother bought is \\boxed{10}.",
