Determine the weight John can bench after tripling the weight he can bench after the injury.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the weight John can bench after the injury.**\n\nJohn starts with a 500-pound bench press. After the injury, his bench press goes down by 80%. Therefore, he can bench only 20% of his original weight.\n\n\\[\n500 \\text{ pounds} \\times 0.20 = 100 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nSo, after the injury, John can bench 100 pounds.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the weight John can bench after tripling the weight he can bench after the injury.**\n\nAfter some training, John manages to triple the weight he can bench after the injury. Therefore, we multiply the weight he can bench after the injury by 3.\n\n\\[\n100 \\text{ pounds} \\times 3 = 300 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nSo, after tripling the weight he can bench after the injury, John can bench 300 pounds.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{300}\\).",

If he started with a 500-pound bench press, we calculate 20% of 500 pounds:\n\n\\[ 500 \\times 0.20 = 100 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSo, after the injury, John's bench press weight is 100 pounds.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the bench press weight after the training.**\n\nAfter some training, John manages to triple the weight he can bench. Therefore, we need to multiply his post-injury bench press weight by 3:\n\n\\[ 100 \\times 3 = 300 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSo, John's current bench press weight is \\(\\boxed{300}\\) pounds.",
