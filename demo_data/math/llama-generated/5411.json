        "To determine how many toy cars Jerome originally had, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of toy cars Jerome bought this month:**\n   Jerome bought twice as many toy cars this month as he did last month. Last month, he bought 5 toy cars.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 5 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, Jerome bought 10 toy cars this month.\n\n2. **Determine the total number of toy cars Jerome bought over the two months:**\n   Add the number of toy cars bought last month to the number of toy cars bought this month.\n   \\[\n   5 + 10 = 15\n   \\]\n   So, Jerome bought a total of 15 toy cars over the two months.\n\n3. **Find out how many toy cars Jerome had originally:**\n   Jerome now has 40 toy cars. To find out how many he had originally, subtract the total number of toy cars he bought over the two months from the current total.\n   \\[\n   40 - 15 = 25\n   \\]\n   So, Jerome originally had 25 toy cars.\n\nTherefore, the number of toy cars Jerome had originally is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
