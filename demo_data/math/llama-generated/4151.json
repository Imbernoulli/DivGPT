        "To determine how much change Jay get, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the items Jay bought.\n2. Subtract the total cost from the amount Jay paid.\n\nFirst, let's find the total cost of the book, pen, and ruler:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost of book} + \\text{Cost of pen} + \\text{Cost of ruler}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = 25 + 4 + 1 = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost from the amount Jay paid:\n\\[\n\\text{Change} = \\text{Amount paid} - \\text{Total cost}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of change Jay get is \\boxed{20}.",
