        "To determine the final balance of the football club, we need to account for the money received from selling players and the money spent on buying players. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Balance**: The club starts with $100 million.\n2. **Money Received from Selling Players**: The club sells 2 players at $10 million each. Therefore, the total money received is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 10 = 20 \\text{ million dollars}\n   \\]\n   Adding this to the initial balance, the new balance is:\n   \\[\n   100 + 20 = 120 \\text{ million dollars}\n   \\]\n3. **Money Spent on Buying Players**: The club buys 4 players at $15 million each. Therefore, the total money spent is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 15 = 60 \\text{ million dollars}\n   \\]\n   Subtracting this from the new balance, the final balance is:\n   \\[\n   120 - 60 = 60 \\text{ million dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money left in the club register is \\(\\boxed{60}\\) million dollars.",
