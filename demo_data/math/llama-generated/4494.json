Rows of corn stalks should produce 9 corn cobs each, and rows of potatoes should produce 30 potatoes each. As he’s checking crop quality, he notices that there are more pests than usual and they have destroyed some of his crops. He thinks that half of his crops have been destroyed by the pests. If the farmer has 10 rows of corn stalks and 5 rows of potatoes, how many crops does the farmer still have?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many crops the farmer still has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of corn cobs before the pests destroyed any.\n2.

Calculate the number of crops remaining after the pests destroyed some.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of corn cobs before the pests destroyed any. The farmer has 10 rows of corn stalks, and each row produces 9 corn cobs:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ rows} \\times 9 \\text{ corn cobs per row} = 90 \\text{ corn cobs} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of potatoes before the pests destroyed any. The farmer has 5 rows of potatoes, and each row produces 30 potatoes:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ rows} \\times 30 \\text{ potatoes per row} = 150 \\text{ potatoes} \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total number of crops before the pests destroyed any. We add the number of corn cobs and the number of potatoes:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ corn cobs} + 150 \\text{ potatoes} = 240 \\text{ crops} \\]\n\nThe farmer thinks that half of his crops have been destroyed by the pests.

Subtract the number of destroyed crops from the total number of crops to find out how many crops remain.\n\nLet's start with the corn cobs:\n- The farmer has 10 rows of corn stalks.\n- Each row produces 9 corn cobs.\n- Therefore, the total number of corn cobs before the pests destroyed any is \\(10 \\times 9 = 90\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of potatoes:\n- The farmer has 5 rows of potatoes.\n- Each row produces 30 potatoes.\n- Therefore, the total number of potatoes before the pests destroyed any is \\(5 \\times 30 = 150\\).\n\nNow, let's determine the number of corn cobs and potatoes destroyed by the pests:\n- The pests destroyed half of the crops.\n- Therefore, the number of corn cobs destroyed is \\(\\frac{90}{2} = 45\\).\n- The number of potatoes destroyed is \\(\\frac{150}{2} = 75\\).\n\nFinally, let's subtract the number of destroyed crops from the total number of crops to find out how many crops remain:\n- The number of corn cobs remaining is \\(90 - 45 = 45\\).\n- The number of potatoes remaining is \\(150 - 75 = 75\\).\n- Therefore, the total number of crops remaining is \\(45 + 75 = 120\\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",

Subtract the destroyed crops from the total number of crops to find out how many crops remain.\n\nLet's start with the corn cobs:\n- The farmer has 10 rows of corn stalks.\n- Each row produces 9 corn cobs.\n- Therefore, the total number of corn cobs is \\(10 \\times 9 = 90\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of potatoes:\n- The farmer has 5 rows of potatoes.\n- Each row produces 30 potatoes.\n- Therefore, the total number of potatoes is \\(5 \\times 30 = 150\\).\n\nNow, let's determine how many crops were destroyed by the pests:\n- The farmer thinks that half of his crops have been destroyed.\n- The total number of crops before the pests destroyed any is \\(90 + 150 = 240\\).\n- Therefore, the number of crops destroyed is \\(\\frac{240}{2} = 120\\).\n\nFinally, let's find out how many crops remain:\n- The total number of crops before the pests destroyed any is 240.\n- The number of crops destroyed is 120.\n- Therefore, the number of crops remaining is \\(240 - 120 = 120\\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
