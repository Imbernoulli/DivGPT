Determine how many drops of blood each mosquito sucks.\n3. Calculate the total number of mosquitoes required by dividing the total number of drops needed to die by the number of drops each mosquito sucks.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of drops of blood you need to lose to die.**\n\nYou need to lose 3 liters of blood to die. Since there are 5000 drops per liter, we can calculate the total number of drops as follows:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ liters} \\times 5000 \\text{ drops/liter} = 15000 \\text{ drops}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many drops of blood each mosquito sucks.**\n\nEach mosquito sucks 20 drops of blood.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of mosquitoes required.**\n\nTo find out how many mosquitoes are needed, we divide the total number of drops required to die by the number of drops each mosquito sucks:\n\\[\n\\frac{15000 \\text{ drops}}{20 \\text{ drops/mosquito}} = 750 \\text{ mosquitoes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of mosquitoes that would have to feed on you to kill you is \\boxed{750}.",
