        "To determine how many more squares Pedro has than both Jesus and Linden combined, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of squares that Jesus and Linden have together.\n2. Subtract the total number of squares that Jesus and Linden have from the number of squares Pedro has.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of squares that Jesus and Linden have together. Jesus has 60 squares and Linden has 75 squares. So, we add these two amounts together:\n\\[ 60 + 75 = 135 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total number of squares that Jesus and Linden have from the number of squares Pedro has. Pedro has 200 squares. So, we subtract 135 from 200:\n\\[ 200 - 135 = 65 \\]\n\nTherefore, Pedro has \\(\\boxed{65}\\) more squares than both Jesus and Linden combined.",
