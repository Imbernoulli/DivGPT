Since each of these students scored 90 - 10 = 80 marks, we have:\n\\[ 15 \\times 80 = 1200 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total marks for the remaining students.

Divide the total marks by the number of students to find the average.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. The first ten students each scored 90 marks.
