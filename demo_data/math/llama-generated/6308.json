        "To determine how much Felix can lift off the ground, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find Felix's brother's weight:**\n   Felix's brother can lift 600 pounds, which is three times his weight. Let \\( B \\) be the weight of Felix's brother. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   3B = 600\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( B \\):\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{600}{3} = 200 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find Felix's weight:**\n   Felix's brother weighs twice as much as Felix. Let \\( F \\) be Felix's weight. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   B = 2F\n   \\]\n   Since \\( B = 200 \\):\n   \\[\n   200 = 2F\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( F \\):\n   \\[\n   F = \\frac{200}{2} = 100 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how much Felix can lift:**\n   Felix can lift off the ground 1.5 times more than he weighs. Therefore, we can calculate Felix's lifting capacity \\( L \\) as:\n   \\[\n   L = 1.5F\n   \\]\n   Since \\( F = 100 \\):\n   \\[\n   L = 1.5 \\times 100 = 150 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Felix can lift off the ground \\(\\boxed{150}\\) pounds.",
        "To determine how much Felix can lift off the ground, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Felix's brother's weight:**\n   - We know that Felix's brother can lift 600 pounds.\n   - Felix's brother can lift three times his own weight.\n   - Let \\( B \\) represent Felix's brother's weight.\n   - Therefore, \\( 3B = 600 \\).\n\n   Solving for \\( B \\):\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{600}{3} = 200 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Felix's weight:**\n   - Felix's brother weighs twice as much as Felix.\n   - Let \\( F \\) represent Felix's weight.\n   - Therefore, \\( B = 2F \\).\n   - We already found \\( B = 200 \\).\n\n   Solving for \\( F \\):\n   \\[\n   F = \\frac{200}{2} = 100 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how much Felix can lift:**\n   - Felix can lift 1.5 times his own weight.\n   - Therefore, the amount Felix can lift is \\( 1.5F \\).\n   - We already found \\( F = 100 \\).\n\n   Solving for the amount Felix can lift:\n   \\[\n   1.5F = 1.5 \\times 100 = 150 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Felix can lift \\(\\boxed{150}\\) pounds off the ground.",

        "To determine how much Felix can lift off the ground, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find Felix's weight:**\n   - We know Felix's brother weighs twice as much as Felix.\n   - Let \\( F \\) represent Felix's weight.\n   - Therefore, Felix's brother's weight is \\( 2F \\).\n\n2. **Determine Felix's brother's lifting capacity:**\n   - Felix's brother can lift three times his weight off the ground.\n   - Since Felix's brother weighs \\( 2F \\), his lifting capacity is \\( 3 \\times 2F = 6F \\).\n\n3. **Given Felix's brother's lifting capacity:**\n   - We are told Felix's brother can lift 600 pounds.\n   - Thus, \\( 6F = 600 \\).\n\n4. **Solve for Felix's weight:**\n   \\[\n   F = \\frac{600}{6} = 100\n   \\]\n   So, Felix weighs 100 pounds.\n\n5. **Determine Felix's lifting capacity:**\n   - Felix can lift off the ground 1.5 times more than he weighs.\n   - Therefore, Felix's lifting capacity is \\( 1.5 \\times F = 1.5 \\times 100 = 150 \\) pounds.\n\nThus, Felix can lift off the ground \\(\\boxed{150}\\) pounds.",
