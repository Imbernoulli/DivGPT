        "To determine how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday to meet her goal, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of situps Shawna should have done by Wednesday.\n2. Subtract the number of situps Shawna has already done on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of situps she should have done.\n\nFirst, Shawna's workout goal is 30 situps per day for three days. Therefore, the total number of situps she should have done by Wednesday is:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ situps/day} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 90 \\text{ situps} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many situps Shawna has already done on Monday and Tuesday. She did 12 situps on Monday and 19 situps on Tuesday. So, the total number of situps she has done so far is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ situps} + 19 \\text{ situps} = 31 \\text{ situps} \\]\n\nTo find out how many more situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday, we subtract the number of situps she has already done from the total number of situps she should have done:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ situps} - 31 \\text{ situps} = 59 \\text{ situps} \\]\n\nTherefore, Shawna needs to do \\(\\boxed{59}\\) situps on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do.",
        "To determine how many situps Shawna needs to do on Wednesday to meet her goal, we start by calculating the total number of situps she has already done on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nFirst, we note that Shawna's goal is 30 situps each day.

Therefore, the total number of situps she has done by the end of Tuesday is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ situps} + 19 \\text{ situps} = 31 \\text{ situps} \\]\n\nSince Shawna's goal is 90 situps over three days, we need to find out how many more situps she needs to do on Wednesday to reach this total. We do this by subtracting the number of situps she has already done from her total goal:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ situps} - 31 \\text{ situps} = 59 \\text{ situps} \\]\n\nTherefore, Shawna needs to do \\(\\boxed{59}\\) situps on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do.",

So, the total number of situps she has done so far is:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ situps} + 19 \\text{ situps} = 31 \\text{ situps} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of situps Shawna has already done from the total number of situps she should have done to find out how many more she needs to do:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ situps} - 31 \\text{ situps} = 59 \\text{ situps} \\]\n\nTherefore, Shawna would have to do \\(\\boxed{59}\\) situps on Wednesday to meet her minimum goal and make up for the ones she didn't do.",
