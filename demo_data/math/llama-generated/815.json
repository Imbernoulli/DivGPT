Since her brother grew 1 inch last year, we calculate Stacy's growth as follows:\n\\[ 6 + 1 = 7 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNext, we add Stacy's growth to her original height. Stacy was 50 inches tall last year, so her current height is:\n\\[ 50 + 7 = 57 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nTherefore, Stacy is now \\(\\boxed{57}\\) inches tall.",
