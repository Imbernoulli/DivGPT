Therefore, the total number of apples is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 5 = 60 \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the apples. John sells each apple for $0.5. Therefore, the total revenue is:\n\\[ 60 \\times 0.5 = 30 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of money John makes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",
