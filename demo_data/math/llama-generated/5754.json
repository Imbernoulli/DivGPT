Given that he can walk 2,000 steps in 30 minutes, we can calculate his walking rate as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Walking rate} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ steps}}{30 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{2000}{30} \\text{ steps per minute} = \\frac{200}{3} \\text{ steps per minute}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many minutes it will take him to walk 10,000 steps. We do this by dividing the total number of steps by his walking rate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time required} = \\frac{10000 \\text{ steps}}{\\frac{200}{3} \\text{ steps per minute}} = 10000 \\text{ steps} \\times \\frac{3}{200} \\text{ minutes per step} = \\frac{10000 \\times 3}{200} \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{30000}{200} \\text{ minutes} = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Roger \\boxed{150} minutes to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.",
        "To determine how many minutes it will take Roger to reach his daily goal of 10,000 steps, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the rate at which Roger walks steps:**\n   Roger walks 2,000 steps in 30 minutes. Therefore, his rate of walking steps is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rate} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ steps}}{30 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{2000}{30} = \\frac{200}{3} \\text{ steps per minute}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up the equation to find the time needed to reach the goal:**\n   Roger's daily goal is 10,000 steps. Let \\( t \\) be the time in minutes it takes him to reach this goal. Using the rate we found, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Rate} \\times t = 10000 \\text{ steps}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the rate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{200}{3} \\text{ steps per minute} \\times t = 10000 \\text{ steps}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( t \\):**\n   To isolate \\( t \\), multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{200}{3}\\), which is \\(\\frac{3}{200}\\):\n   \\[\n   t = 10000 \\text{ steps} \\times \\frac{3}{200} \\text{ minutes per step}\n \\]\n   Simplify the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{10000 \\times 3}{200} = \\frac{30000}{200} = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Roger \\(\\boxed{150}\\) minutes to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.",

        "To determine how many minutes it will take Roger to reach his goal of 10,000 steps, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Roger's walking rate in steps per minute.\n2. Use the walking rate to calculate the total time required to walk 10,000 steps.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Roger's walking rate.**\n\nRoger walks 2,000 steps in 30 minutes. To find his walking rate in steps per minute, we divide the number of steps by the number of minutes:\n\\[\n\\text{Walking rate} = \\frac{2,000 \\text{ steps}}{30 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{2,000}{30} = \\frac{200}{3} \\text{ steps per minute}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total time required to walk 10,000 steps.**\n\nNow that we know Roger's walking rate is \\(\\frac{200}{3}\\) steps per minute, we can find out how many minutes it will take him to walk 10,000 steps by dividing the total number of steps by his walking rate:\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = \\frac{10,000 \\text{ steps}}{\\frac{200}{3} \\text{ steps per minute}} = 10,000 \\times \\frac{3}{200} = \\frac{10,000 \\times 3}{200} = \\frac{30,000}{200} = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Roger \\(\\boxed{150}\\) minutes to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.",
        "To determine how many minutes it will take Roger to reach his daily goal of 10,000 steps, we start by finding out how many steps he can walk per minute. We know that Roger can walk 2,000 steps in 30 minutes. Therefore, his walking rate is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Walking rate} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ steps}}{30 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{2000 \\div 10}{30 \\div 10} = \\frac{200 \\text{ steps}}{3 \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]\n\nThis means Roger can walk 200 steps every 3 minutes. To find out how many minutes it will take him to walk 10,000 steps, we set up the following proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time to walk 10,000 steps} = \\left( \\frac{3 \\text{ minutes}}{200 \\text{ steps}} \\right) \\times 10000 \\text{ steps} = \\frac{3 \\times 10000}{200} = \\frac{30000}{200} = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take Roger \\boxed{150} minutes to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.",

We do this by dividing the total number of steps by the number of steps he walks per minute:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Minutes to reach 10,000 steps} = \\frac{10000 \\text{ steps}}{\\frac{200}{3} \\text{ steps per minute}} = 10000 \\times \\frac{3}{200} = \\frac{10000 \\times 3}{200} = \\frac{30000}{200} = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Roger \\boxed{150} minutes to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.",

We need to find the time \\( t \\) it will take for him to walk 10,000 steps at his walking rate.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total时间} = \\text{Steps goal} \\div \\text{Walking rate}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{10,000 \\text{ steps}}{\\frac{200}{3} \\text{ steps per minute}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the division:**\n   Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal.\n   \\[\n   t = 10,000 \\text{ steps} \\times \\frac{3}{200} \\text{ minutes per step}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   t = 10,000 \\times \\frac{3}{200} = \\frac{10,000 \\times 3}{200} = \\frac{30,000}{200} = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Roger \\(\\boxed{150}\\) minutes to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.",

        "To determine how many minutes it will take Roger to reach his daily goal of 10,000 steps, we need to first find out how many minutes it takes him to walk 1,000 steps. We know that Roger can walk 2,000 steps in 30 minutes. Therefore, we can calculate the time it takes to walk 1,000 steps by dividing 30 minutes by 2,000 steps and then multiplying by 1,000 steps.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time to walk 1,000 steps} = \\left(\\frac{30 \\text{ minutes}}{2,000 \\text{ steps}}\\right) \\times 1,000 \\text{ steps} = \\frac{30 \\times 1,000}{2,000} = \\frac{30,000}{2,000} = 15 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow that we know it takes Roger 15 minutes to walk 1,000 steps, we can find out how many minutes it will take him to walk 10,000 steps by multiplying the time it takes to walk 1,000 steps by 10.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time to walk 10,000 steps} = 15 \\text{ minutes/1,000 steps} \\times 10,000 \\text{ steps} = 15 \\times 10 = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Roger \\boxed{150} minutes to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.",
        "To determine how many minutes it will take Roger to reach his daily goal of 10,000 steps, we start by noting his walking rate. Roger can walk 2,000 steps in 30 minutes. We can express this rate as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ steps}}{30 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{2000}{30} = \\frac{200}{3} \\text{ steps per minute} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many minutes it will take him to walk 10,000 steps. Let \\( t \\) be the number of minutes required to walk 10,000 steps. Since his rate is \\(\\frac{200}{3}\\) steps per minute, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{200}{3} \\times t = 10000 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( t \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{200}{3}\\), which is \\(\\frac{3}{200}\\):\n\n\\[ t = 10000 \\times \\frac{3}{200} = \\frac{10000 \\times 3}{200} = \\frac{30000}{200} = 150 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Roger \\(\\boxed{150}\\) minutes to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.",
