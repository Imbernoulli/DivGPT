        "To determine Ramon's current age, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Loui's current age.\n2. Determine Ramon's age in twenty years.\n3. Use the relationship between Ramon's age in twenty years and Loui's current age to find Ramon's current age.\n\nLet's start with the information given:\n- Loui is currently 23 years old.\n- In twenty years, Ramon will be twice as old as Loui today.\n\nFirst, calculate Loui's age in twenty years:\n\\[ 23 + 20 = 43 \\]\nSo, in twenty years, Loui will be 43 years old.\n\nAccording to the problem, in twenty years, Ramon will be twice as old as Loui today. Since Loui is currently 23 years old, twice his current age is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 23 = 46 \\]\nSo, in twenty years, Ramon will be 46 years old.\n\nLet \\( R \\) be Ramon's current age. In twenty years, Ramon's age will be \\( R + 20 \\). We know that in twenty years, Ramon will be 46 years old, so we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ R + 20 = 46 \\]\n\nTo find \\( R \\), subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ R = 46 - 20 \\]\n\\[ R = 26 \\]\n\nTherefore, Ramon's current age is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).",
