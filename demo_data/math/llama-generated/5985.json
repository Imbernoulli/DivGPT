        "To determine the total number of genuine purses and handbags that Tirzah has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of fake purses.\n2. Calculate the number of fake handbags.\n3. Subtract the number of fake purses from the total number of purses to find the number of genuine purses.\n4.
