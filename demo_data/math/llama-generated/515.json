        "To determine how long it will take Veronica to pit all the cherries needed for the cherry pie, we can break the problem down into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cherries needed:**\n   Veronica needs 3 pounds of pitted cherries. Since there are 80 single cherries in one pound, we can find the total number of cherries by multiplying the number of pounds by the number of cherries per pound:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ pounds} \\times 80 \\text{ cherries per pound} = 240 \\text{ cherries}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many cherries Veronica can pit in one minute:**\n   It takes Veronica 10 minutes to pit 20 cherries. Therefore, we can find the number of cherries she can pit in one minute by dividing the number of cherries by the number of minutes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20 \\text{ cherries}}{10 \\text{ minutes}} = 2 \\text{ cherries per minute}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total time needed to pit all the cherries:**\n   Since Veronica can pit 2 cherries in one minute, we can find the total time needed to pit 240 cherries by dividing the total number of cherries by the number of cherries she can pit per minute:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{240 \\text{ cherries}}{2 \\text{ cherries per minute}} = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**\n   Since there are 60 minutes in one hour, we can convert 120 minutes to hours by dividing the number of minutes by the number of minutes per hour:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes per hour}} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Veronica \\(\\boxed{2}\\) hours to pit all the cherries.",
