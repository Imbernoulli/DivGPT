        "To determine the total amount of time Paris studies during the semester, we need to break down her study schedule into two parts: her weekday study hours and her weekend study hours.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of weekdays in the semester. Since the fall semester lasts 15 weeks and there are 5 weekdays in each week, we have:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ weeks} \\times 5 \\text{ weekdays/week} = 75 \\text{ weekdays} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of hours Paris studies during the weekdays. She studies 3 hours each weekday, so:\n\\[ 75 \\text{ weekdays} \\times 3 \\text{ hours/day} = 225 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of hours Paris studies during the weekends. She studies 4 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ hours} + 5 \\text{ hours} = 9 \\text{ hours/weekend} \\]\nSince the semester lasts 15 weeks, the total number of hours she studies during the weekends is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ weekends} \\times 9 \\text{ hours/weekend} = 135 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total number of hours studied during the weekdays and the weekends to get the total study time for the semester:\n\\[ 225 \\text{ hours} + 135 \\text{ hours} = 360 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Paris studies during the semester is:\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]",

She studies 3 hours each weekday, so the total number of hours she studies on weekdays is:\n\\[ 75 \\times 3 = 225 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of hours Paris studies on weekends. She studies 4 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so the total number of hours she studies in one weekend is:\n\\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSince there are 15 weeks in the semester and each week has 1 weekend, the total number of weekends in the semester is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ weekends} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Paris studies on weekends is:\n\\[ 15 \\times 9 = 135 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total number of hours studied on weekdays and weekends to get the total number of hours Paris studies during the semester:\n\\[ 225 + 135 = 360 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, the total time Paris studies during the semester is:\n\\[ \\boxed{360} \\]",

        "To determine the total amount of time Paris studies during the fall semester, we need to break down her study schedule into weekdays and weekends, and then sum up the total hours for the entire semester.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of weeks in the semester:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ weeks}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of days in the weekdays for the entire semester. Since there are 5 weekdays in each week, we multiply:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ days/week} \\times 15 \\text{ weeks} = 75 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\n Paris studies 3 hours each weekday. Therefore, the total number of hours she studies on weekdays is:\n\\[\n75 \\text{ days} \\times 3 \\text{ hours/day} = 225 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of hours Paris studies on weekends. She studies 4 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. First, we find the total hours for one weekend:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ hours} + 5 \\text{ hours} = 9 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSince there are 15 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours she studies on weekends is:\n\\[\n15 \\text{ weeks} \\times 9 \\text{ hours/week} = 135 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the total hours studied on weekdays and weekends to find the total amount of time Paris studies during the semester:\n\\[\n225 \\text{ hours} + 135 \\text{ hours} = 360 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time Paris studies during the semester is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{360}\n\\]"
