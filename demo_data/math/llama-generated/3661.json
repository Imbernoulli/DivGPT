        "To determine the total number of dresses that Debora, Melissa, and Emily have, we need to find out how many dresses each person has and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we know that Emily has 16 dresses. We can write this as:\n\\[ E = 16 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Melissa has half the number of dresses Emily has. Therefore, we can calculate the number of dresses Melissa has by dividing Emily's number of dresses by 2:\n\\[ M = \\frac{E}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Debora has 12 more dresses than Melissa. Therefore, we can calculate the number of dresses Debora has by adding 12 to the number of dresses Melissa has:\n\\[ D = M + 12 = 8 + 12 = 20 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total number of dresses that Debora, Melissa, and Emily have by adding the number of dresses each person has:\n\\[ D + M + E = 20 + 8 + 16 = 44 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of dresses that the three of them have is:\n\\[ \\boxed{44} \\]",
