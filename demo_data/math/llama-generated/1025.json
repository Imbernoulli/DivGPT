Therefore, the cost of the nuts is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ kg} \\times 12 \\text{ dollars/kg} = 36 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the dried fruits. Adam bought 2.5 kilograms of dried fruits, and each kilogram costs $8. Therefore, the cost of the dried fruits is:\n\\[ 2.5 \\text{ kg} \\times 8 \\text{ dollars/kg} = 20 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of the nuts and the cost of the dried fruits to find the total cost of Adam's purchases:\n\\[ 36 \\text{ dollars} + 20 \\text{ dollars} = 56 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the total cost of Adam's purchases is:\n\\[ \\boxed{56} \\]",
