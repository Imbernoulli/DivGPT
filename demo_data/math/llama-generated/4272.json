        "To determine how many fish Paul caught when he was fishing for 12 hours, we start by finding the rate at which he catches fish.

Last week, Paul caught 5 fish for every 2 hours of fishing. First, we find his fishing rate in terms of fish per hour.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fishing rate} = \\frac{5 \\text{ fish}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 2.5 \\text{ fish per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we use this rate to calculate the number of fish he caught in 12 hours. We multiply the fishing rate by the number of hours he fished:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fish} = 2.5 \\text{ fish per hour} \\times 12 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ fish}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of fish Paul caught when he was fishing for 12 hours is \\boxed{30}.",
        "To determine how many fish Paul caught when he was fishing for 12 hours, we start by finding the rate at which he catches fish. According to the problem, Paul catches 5 fish for every 2 hours of fishing. We can express this rate as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate of catching fish} = \\frac{5 \\text{ fish}}{2 \\text{ hours}}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many fish he catches in 12 hours. To do this, we multiply the rate by the number of hours he was fishing:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of fish caught in 12 hours} = \\left( \\frac{5 \\text{ fish}}{2 \\text{ hours}} \\right) \\times 12 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify the expression by canceling out the hours in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{5}{2} \\right) \\times 12 = 5 \\times \\left( \\frac{12}{2} \\right) = 5 \\times 6 = 30\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of fish Paul caught when he was fishing for 12 hours is \\boxed{30}.",
        "To determine how many fish Paul caught when he was fishing for 12 hours, we start by finding his fishing rate in fish per hour. According to the problem, Paul catches 5 fish for every 2 hours. Therefore, his fishing rate is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fishing rate} = \\frac{5 \\text{ fish}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 2.5 \\text{ fish per hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of fish he catches when he fish for 12 hours. We do this by multiplying his fishing rate by the total number of hours he fished:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total fish} = \\text{Fishing rate} \\times \\text{Total hours} = 2.5 \\text{ fish per hour} \\times 12 \\text{ hours} = 30 \\text{ fish}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of fish Paul caught when he was fishing for 12 hours is \\boxed{30}.",

To do this, we can set up a proportion where the number of fish caught is directly proportional to the number of hours spent fishing:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5 \\text{ fish}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = \\frac{x \\text{ fish}}{12 \\text{ hours}}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( x \\) is the number of fish caught in 12 hours.
