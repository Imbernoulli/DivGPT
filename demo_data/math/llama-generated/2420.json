        "To determine the total number of fish the fisherman caught, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Bass:**\n   The fisherman catches 32 bass.\n\n2. **Trout:**\n   The number of trout is given as 1/4 the number of bass. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of trout} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 32 = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Blue Gill:**\n   The number of blue gill is given as double the number of bass. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of blue gill} = 2 \\times 32 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Number of Fish:**\n   To find the total number of fish, we add the number of bass, trout, and blue gill:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of fish} = 32 + 8 + 64 = 104\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of fish the fisherman caught is \\(\\boxed{104}\\).",
