        "Let's start by determining the number of frisbees Bella currently has. We know that Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees, and she currently has 60 marbles. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of frisbees} = \\frac{\\text{Number of marbles}}{2} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many deck cards Bella has. We know that she has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of deck cards} = \\text{Number of frisbees} - 20 = 30 - 20 = 10 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many of each item Bella will have after buying \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) times more of each item. First, let's calculate the new number of marbles:\n\n\\[ \\text{New number of marbles} = \\text{Current number of marbles} + \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\text{Current number of marbles} = 60 + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 60 = 60 + 24 = 84 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the new number of frisbees:\n\n\\[ \\text{New number of frisbees} = \\text{Current number of frisbees} + \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\text{Current number of frisbees} = 30 + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 30 = 30 + 12 = 42 \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the new number of deck cards:\n\n\\[ \\text{New number of deck cards} = \\text{Current number of deck cards} + \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\text{Current number of deck cards} = 10 + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 10 = 10 + 4 = 14 \\]\n\nFinally, we add up the new number of marbles, frisbees, and deck cards to find the total number of items Bella will have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of items} = \\text{New number of marbles} + \\text{New number of frisbees} + \\text{New number of deck cards} = 84 + 42 + 14 = 140 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of items Bella will have is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]",

Sum the total number of items after the purchase.\n\nFirst, we know Bella has 60 marbles.

The number of each item after the purchase will be the original number plus 2/5 of the original number:\n\\[\n\\text{New number of marbles} = 60 + \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 60\\right) = 60 + 24 = 84\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{New number of frisbees} = 30 + \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 30\\right) = 30 + 12 = 42\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{New number of deck cards} = 10 + \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 10\\right) = 10 + 4 = 14\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the total number of items after the purchase:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of items} = \\text{New number of marbles} + \\text{New number of frisbees} + \\text{New number of deck cards} = 84 + 42 + 14 = 140\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of items Bella will have is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{140}\n\\]",
