        "Let's define the variables for the weights of Antoinette and Rupert. Let \\( R \\) be Rupert's weight in kilograms. According to the problem, Antoinette weighs 7 less kilograms than twice Rupert's weight. Therefore, Antoinette's weight can be expressed as \\( 2R - 7 \\) kilograms.\n\nThe problem also states that together they weigh 98 kilograms. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ R + (2R - 7) = 98 \\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[ 3R - 7 = 98 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( R \\), we add 7 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3R = 105 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ R = 35 \\]\n\nSo, Rupert's weight is 35 kilograms.
