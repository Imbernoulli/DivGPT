Jackson's investment quadruples in value, so we multiply the initial investment by 4:\n\\[\n500 \\times 4 = 2000\n\\]\nSo, Jackson's investment is now worth $2000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the final value of Brandon's investment. Brandon's investment is reduced to 20% of the initial value. To find 20% of $500, we multiply $500 by 0.20:\n\\[\n500 \\times 0.20 = 100\n\\]\nSo, Brandon's investment is now worth $100.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more money Jackson has than Brandon by subtracting the value of Brandon's investment from the value of Jackson's investment:\n\\[\n2000 - 100 = 1900\n\\]\nTherefore, Jackson has \\(\\boxed{1900}\\) dollars more than Brandon.",
        "To determine how much more money Jackson has than Brandon after their investments change in value, we need to calculate the new value of each investment and then find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the new value of Jackson's investment:\n- Jackson's initial investment is $500.\n- His investment quadruples in value.\n- Quadrupling means multiplying by 4.\n\n\\[\n500 \\times 4 = 2000\n\\]\n\nSo, Jackson's new investment value is $2000.\n\nNext, let's calculate the new value of Brandon's investment:\n- Brandon's initial investment is $500.\n- His investment is reduced to 20% of the initial value.\n- 20% of $500 can be calculated by multiplying $500 by 0.20.\n\n\\[\n500 \\times 0.20 = 100\n\\]\n\nSo, Brandon's new investment value is $100.\n\nNow, we find the difference between Jackson's and Brandon's new investment values:\n\n\\[\n2000 - 100 = 1900\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jackson has \\(\\boxed{1900}\\) dollars more than Brandon."
