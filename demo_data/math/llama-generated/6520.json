Determine the cost per slice of bread.\n4. Convert the cost per slice from dollars to cents.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the 3 loaves of bread. Tim pays with 2 $20 bills, which is $40, and gets $16 change. Therefore, the total cost of the bread is:\n\\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much each loaf of bread costs. Since Tim bought 3 loaves, we divide the total cost by 3:\n\\[ \\frac{24}{3} = 8 \\text{ dollars per loaf} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how much each slice of bread costs. Each loaf has 20 slices, so the cost per slice is:\n\\[ \\frac{8}{20} = 0.40 \\text{ dollars per slice} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the cost per slice from dollars to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we multiply 0.40 by 100:\n\\[ 0.40 \\times 100 = 40 \\text{ cents per slice} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of each slice of bread is:\n\\[ \\boxed{40} \\]",
