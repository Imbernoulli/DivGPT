        "Let's denote the number of trucks on the highway as \\( T \\). According to the problem, the number of cars on the highway is twice the number of trucks. Therefore, the number of cars can be expressed as \\( 2T \\).\n\nThe total number of vehicles passing on the highway is the sum of the number of cars and the number of trucks. This is given as 300.
