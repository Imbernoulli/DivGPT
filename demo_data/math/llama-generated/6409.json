        "To determine the total number of views Kallie's video had gained on YouTube, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the views on the first day:**\n   Kallie received 4000 views on the first day.\n\n2. **Calculate the increase in views after 4 days:**\n   The problem states that the number of views increased by a number ten times more than the views on the first day. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 4000 = 40000\n   \\]\n   So, the number of views increased by 40000 after 4 days.\n\n3. **Calculate the total views after 4 days:**\n   Adding the initial views and the increase:\n   \\[\n   4000 + 40000 = 44000\n   \\]\n   So, the total views after 4 days is 44000.\n\n4. **Calculate the increase in views after another 2 days:**\n   The problem states that 50000 more people viewed the video after another 2 days. Therefore, we add this to the total views after 4 days:\n   \\[\n   44000 + 50000 = 94000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of views Kallie's video had gained on YouTube is \\(\\boxed{94000}\\).",
