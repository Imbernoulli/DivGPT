        "To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the age of the hyena.\n2. Calculate the age of the lioness's baby.\n3. Calculate the age of the hyena's baby.\n4. Find the sum of the ages of the babies in five years.\n\nFirst, we know that the lioness is 12 years old and her age is twice the age of the hyena. Let's denote the age of the hyena as \\( h \\). According to the problem, we have:\n\\[ 12 = 2h \\]\nSolving for \\( h \\), we get:\n\\[ h = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\]\nSo, the hyena is 6 years old.\n\nNext, we need to find the age of the lioness's baby. The baby of the lioness is half the age of the lioness. Therefore, the age of the lioness's baby is:\n\\[ \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\]\n\nSimilarly, we need to find the age of the hyena's baby. The baby of the hyena is half the age of the hyena. Therefore, the age of the hyena's baby is:\n\\[ \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the ages of the babies in five years. In five years, the lioness's baby will be:\n\\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \\]\nAnd the hyena's baby will be:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\nSo, the sum of the ages of the babies in five years is:\n\\[ 11 + 8 = 19 \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the age of the babies in five years is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).",
