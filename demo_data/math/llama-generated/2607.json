Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[ 2 \\times 90 = 180 \\text{ pounds} \\]\nSo, Tony can lift 180 pounds in the military press exercise.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much weight Tony can lift in the squat exercise. The problem states that he can squat 5 times the weight that he can lift in the military press. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[ 5 \\times 180 = 900 \\text{ pounds} \\]\nSo, Tony can lift 900 pounds in the squat exercise.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{900} \\]",

        "To determine how much weight Tony can lift in the squat exercise, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the weight Tony can lift in the military press:**\n   Tony can lift 90 pounds with one arm in the curl. The military press requires him to lift over his head twice the weight of the curl.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight in military press} = 2 \\times 90 = 180 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the weight Tony can lift in the squat:**\n   Tony can squat 5 times the weight he can lift in the military press.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight in squat} = 5 \\times 180 = 900 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of weight Tony can lift in the squat exercise is \\(\\boxed{900}\\) pounds."
