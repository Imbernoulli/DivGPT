The store is offering a 20% discount, so we need to find 20% of \\$280.00.\n\\[ 20\\% \\times \\$280.00 = 0.20 \\times \\$280.00 = \\$56.00 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount Bailey will spend.\n\\[ \\$280.00 - \\$56.00 = \\$224.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Bailey will spend on towel sets is:\n\\[ \\boxed{224} \\]",
