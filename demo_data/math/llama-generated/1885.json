        "To determine the total amount Terry spent over the three days, we need to calculate the amount spent each day and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount spent on each day:\n- On Monday, Terry spent $6.\n- On Tuesday, Terry spent twice as much as he did on Monday. Therefore, the amount spent on Tuesday is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 6 = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- On Wednesday, Terry spent double what he did on the previous two days combined.
