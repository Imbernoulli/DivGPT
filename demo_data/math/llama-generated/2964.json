According to the problem, Rachel has three less than one-half as many erasers as Tanya has red erasers. Since Tanya has 10 red erasers, we calculate one-half of 10:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{2} = 5\n\\]\nThen, we subtract 3 from 5 to find out how many erasers Rachel has:\n\\[\n5 - 3 = 2\n\\]\n\nFinally, we need to find out how many erasers Hanna has.
