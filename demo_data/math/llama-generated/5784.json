        "To determine the total number of coffee bags Droid uses in a week, we need to break down the usage into daily and then weekly amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of bags used in one day:\n\n1. **Morning Usage:**\n   Droid uses 3 bags of coffee beans in the morning.\n\n2. **Afternoon Usage:**\n   Droid uses triple the number of bags he uses in the morning. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ bags}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evening Usage:**\n   Droid uses twice the number of bags he uses in the morning.
