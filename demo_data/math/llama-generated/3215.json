However, this year, the apple tree yield was excellent, and it grew 200 apples. Magdalena picked 1/5 of the fruits on the first day, twice that number on the second day, and 20 more apples than he picked on the first day on the third day.

Calculate the number of apples picked on the first day.\n2. Calculate the number of apples picked on the second day.\n3. Calculate the number of apples picked on the third day.\n4. Sum the apples picked over the three days.\n5. Subtract the total number of apples picked from the initial number of apples.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Magdalena picked \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the apples on the first day.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times 200 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, she picked 40 apples on the first day.\n\n2. Magdalena picked twice the number of apples picked on the first day on the second day.\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 40 = 80\n   \\]\n   So, she picked 80 apples on the second day.\n\n3. Magdalena picked 20 more apples than she picked on the first day on the third day.\n   \\[\n   40 + 20 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, she picked 60 apples on the third day.\n\n4. Sum the apples picked over the three days.\n   \\[\n   40 + 80 + 60 = 180\n   \\]\n   So, she picked a total of 180 apples over the three days.\n\n5. Subtract the total number of apples picked from the initial number of apples.\n   \\[\n   200 - 180 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the total number of apples remaining in the tree is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of apples remaining on the tree, we need to calculate the number of apples Magdalena picked each day and subtract that from the initial number of apples.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of apples Magdalena picked on the first day:\n\\[\n\\text{Apples picked on the first day} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 200 = 40\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of apples Magdalena picked on the second day. She picked twice the number of apples she picked on the first day:\n\\[\n\\text{Apples picked on the second day} = 2 \\times 40 = 80\n\\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the number of apples Magdalena picked on the third day. She picked 20 more apples than she picked on the first day:\n\\[\n\\text{Apples picked on the third day} = 40 + 20 = 60\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the total number of apples picked over the three days:\n\\[\n\\text{Total apples picked} = 40 + 80 + 60 = 180\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the number of apples remaining on the tree by subtracting the total number of apples picked from the initial number of apples:\n\\[\n\\text{Apples remaining} = 200 - 180 = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of apples remaining in the tree is \\boxed{20}.",
