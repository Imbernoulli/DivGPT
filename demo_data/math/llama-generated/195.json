        "To determine Azalea's profit from the produce of her sheep farm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of wool produced by the sheep:**\n   - Each sheep produces 10 pounds of wool.\n   - Azalea has 200 sheep.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total wool produced} = 200 \\text{ sheep} \\times 10 \\text{ pounds/sheep} = 2000 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the wool:**\n   - The wool is sold at $20 per pound.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total revenue} = 2000 \\text{ pounds} \\times 20 \\text{ dollars/pound} = 40000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the profit:**\n   - Azalea paid the shearer $2000.\n   - Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost ( payment to the shearer) from the total revenue.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 40000 \\text{ dollars} - 2000 \\text{ dollars} = 38000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Azalea's profit from the produce of her sheep farm is \\(\\boxed{38000}\\).",
        "To determine the profit Ms. Azalea made from the produce of her sheep farm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of wool produced by the sheep.\n2. Determine the total revenue from selling the wool.\n3. Subtract the cost paid to the shearer from the total revenue to find the profit.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of wool produced by the sheep. Ms. Azalea has 200 sheep, and each sheep produces 10 pounds of wool. Therefore, the total amount of wool produced is:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ sheep} \\times 10 \\text{ pounds/sheep} = 2000 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total revenue from selling the wool.
