        "To determine how much more caffeine Brandy can safely consume that day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of caffeine Brandy has already consumed.\n2. Subtract this amount from the maximum safe amount of caffeine to find out how much more she can consume.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of caffeine Brandy has already consumed. She drinks 4 energy drinks, and each energy drink contains 120 mg of caffeine. So, we multiply the number of energy drinks by the caffeine content per energy drink:\n\\[ 4 \\times 120 = 480 \\text{ mg} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount of caffeine she has already consumed from the maximum safe amount of caffeine:\n\\[ 500 - 480 = 20 \\text{ mg} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of caffeine Brandy can still safely consume that day is \\(\\boxed{20}\\) mg.",

Subtract this amount from the maximum safe amount of caffeine to find out how much more she can consume.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of caffeine Brandy has already consumed. She drinks 4 energy drinks, and each energy drink contains 120 mg of caffeine. Therefore, the total caffeine consumption is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 120 \\text{ mg} = 480 \\text{ mg} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount of caffeine Brandy has already consumed from the maximum safe amount of caffeine to find out how much more she can consume:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ mg} - 480 \\text{ mg} = 20 \\text{ mg} \\]\n\nSo, the amount of caffeine Brandy can still safely consume that day is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
        "To determine how much more caffeine Brandy can safely consume that day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of caffeine Brandy has already consumed.\n2. Subtract the amount of caffeine already consumed from the maximum safe amount of caffeine.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of caffeine Brandy has already consumed. She drinks 4 energy drinks, and each energy drink contains 120 mg of caffeine. Therefore, the total caffeine consumption is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ energy drinks} \\times 120 \\text{ mg/energy drink} = 480 \\text{ mg} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount of caffeine already consumed from the maximum safe amount of caffeine. The maximum safe amount of caffeine is 500 mg. Therefore, the remaining amount of caffeine she can safely consume is:\n\\[ 500 \\text{ mg} - 480 \\text{ mg} = 20 \\text{ mg} \\]\n\nSo, the amount of caffeine Brandy can still safely consume that day is \\(\\boxed{20}\\) mg."
