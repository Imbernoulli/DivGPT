Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Cost of the bread:**\n   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of bread.\n   - The cost of one slice of bread is $0.15.\n   - Therefore, the total cost of the bread is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 0.15 = 0.30 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Cost of the ham:**\n   - Each sandwich uses 1 slice of ham.\n   - The cost of one slice of ham is $0.25.\n   - Therefore, the total cost of the ham is:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 0.25 = 0.25 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Cost of the cheese:**\n   - Each sandwich uses 1 slice of cheese.\n   - The cost of one slice of cheese is $0.35.\n   - Therefore, the total cost of the cheese is:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 0.35 = 0.35 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total cost of the sandwich:**\n   - We add the costs of the bread, the ham, and the cheese:\n     \\[\n     0.30 + 0.25 + 0.35 = 0.90 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Convert the total cost to cents:**\n   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we multiply the total cost by 100:\n     \\[\n     0.90 \\times 100 = 90 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost for Joe to make a sandwich with one slice of each protein is \\(\\boxed{90}\\) cents.",
