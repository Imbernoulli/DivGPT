Determine how many bags weighing 40 kilograms each can be loaded with the remaining capacity.\n\nLet's start with the calculations:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the supplies loaded yesterday.**\n- The truck was loaded with 100 boxes, each weighing 100 kg.\n  \\[\n  100 \\text{ boxes} \\times 100 \\text{ kg/box} = 10000 \\text{ kg}\n  \\]\n- The truck was also loaded with 10 crates, each weighing 60 kg.\n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ crates} \\times 60 \\text{ kg/crate} = 600 \\text{ kg}\n  \\]\n- Adding these together gives the total weight loaded yesterday.\n  \\[\n  10000 \\text{ kg} + 600 \\text{ kg} = 10600 \\text{ kg}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the supplies loaded today.**\n- The truck was loaded with 50 sacks, each weighing 50 kg.\n  \\[\n  50 \\text{ sacks} \\times 50 \\text{ kg/sack} = 2500 \\text{ kg}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the weights from both days to find the total current load.**\n- Adding the weight loaded yesterday and the weight loaded today gives the total current load.\n  \\[\n  10600 \\text{ kg} + 2500 \\text{ kg} = 13100 \\text{ kg}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the total current load from the truck's maximum capacity to find the remaining capacity.**\n- The truck's maximum capacity is 13500 kg.\n  \\[\n  13500 \\text{ kg} - 13100 \\text{ kg} = 400 \\text{ kg}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 5: Determine how many bags weighing 40 kilograms each can be loaded with the remaining capacity.**\n- Each bag weighs 40 kg.\n  \\[\n  \\frac{400 \\text{ kg}}{40 \\text{ kg/bag}} = 10 \\text{ bags}\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bags weighing 40 kilograms each that can still load in the truck is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "To determine how many bags weighing 40 kilograms each can still be loaded into the truck, we need to calculate the total weight of the supplies already loaded and subtract that from the truck's maximum capacity.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the weight of the supplies loaded yesterday:\n- The truck was loaded with 100 boxes, each weighing 100 kgs.\n  \\[\n  100 \\text{ boxes} \\times 100 \\text{ kg/box} = 10,000 \\text{ kg}\n  \\]\n- Then, it was loaded with 10 crates, each weighing 60 kgs.\n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ crates} \\times 60 \\text{ kg/crate} = 600 \\text{ kg}\n  \\]\n- Adding these together gives the total weight of the supplies loaded yesterday:\n  \\[\n  10,000 \\text{ kg} + 600 \\text{ kg} = 10,600 \\text{ kg}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the weight of the supplies loaded today:\n- The truck was loaded with 50 sacks, each weighing 50 kgs.\n  \\[\n  50 \\text{ sacks} \\times 50 \\text{ kg/sack} = 2,500 \\text{ kg}\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total weight of all the supplies loaded into the truck:\n\\[\n10,600 \\text{ kg} + 2,500 \\text{ kg} = 13,100 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nThe truck's maximum capacity is 13,500 kgs. To find out how many bags weighing 40 kgs each can still be loaded, we subtract the total weight of the supplies already loaded from the truck's maximum capacity:\n\\[\n13,500 \\text{ kg} - 13,100 \\text{ kg} = 400 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each bag to determine how many bags can still be loaded:\n\\[\n\\frac{400 \\text{ kg}}{40 \\text{ kg/bag}} = 10 \\text{ bags}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of bags weighing 40 kilograms each that can still be loaded in the truck is \\boxed{10}.",
