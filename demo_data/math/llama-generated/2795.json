        "To determine how much James's favorite basketball player gets paid for the week, we need to calculate the average points scored per game over the five games and then determine the payment based on that average.\n\nFirst, let's list the points scored in each game:\n- First game: 30 points\n- Second game: 28 points\n- Third game: 32 points\n- Fourth game: 34 points\n- Fifth game: 26 points\n\nNext, we sum these points:\n\\[ 30 + 28 + 32 + 34 + 26 \\]\n\nWe can add these step by step:\n\\[ 30 + 28 = 58 \\]\n\\[ 58 + 32 = 90 \\]\n\\[ 90 + 34 = 124 \\]\n\\[ 124 + 26 = 150 \\]\n\nSo, the total points scored over the five games is 150.\n\nNow, we calculate the average points per game by dividing the total points by the number of games:\n\\[ \\frac{150}{5} = 30 \\]\n\nThe average points per game is 30. Since the player gets paid $10,000 if he averages 30 or more points a game, he gets paid:\n\\[ \\$10,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the player gets paid \\(\\boxed{10000}\\) dollars for the week.",
