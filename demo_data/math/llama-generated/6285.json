        "To determine how many blue socks Joan has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of white socks.\n2. Subtract the number of white socks from the total number of socks to find the number of blue socks.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of white socks. Joan has 180 socks in total, and two thirds of them are white. Therefore, we multiply 180 by \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of white socks} = 180 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 180 \\times 0.6667 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, Joan has 120 white socks. Next, we subtract the number of white socks from the total number of socks to find the number of blue socks:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue socks} = 180 - 120 = 60\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of blue socks Joan has is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
