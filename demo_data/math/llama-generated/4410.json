Calculate the total number of pickles Phillip can make with the cucumbers.\n2. Determine how many jars are needed to hold these pickles.\n3. Calculate the total amount of vinegar required for the jars.\n4. Subtract the total amount of vinegar used from the initial amount of vinegar.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pickles Phillip can make with the cucumbers.**\n\nPhillip has 10 cucumbers, and each cucumber makes 6 pickles:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ cucumbers} \\times 6 \\text{ pickles per cucumber} = 60 \\text{ pickles} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many jars are needed to hold these pickles.**\n\nEach jar can hold 12 pickles:\n\\[ \\frac{60 \\text{ pickles}}{12 \\text{ pickles per jar}} = 5 \\text{ jars} \\]\n\nSince Phillip has only 4 jars, he can only make pickles for 4 jars.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of vinegar required for the jars.**\n\nEach jar requires 10 ounces of vinegar:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ jars} \\times 10 \\text{ ounces per jar} = 40 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the total amount of vinegar used from the initial amount of vinegar.**\n\nPhillip started with 100 ounces of vinegar:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ ounces} - 40 \\text{ ounces} = 60 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ounces of vinegar left is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).",
        "To determine how many ounces of vinegar Phillip has left after making as many pickles as he can with his supplies, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pickles Phillip can make:**\n   - Each cucumber makes 6 pickles.\n   - Phillip has 10 cucumbers.\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ cucumbers} \\times 6 \\text{ pickles per cucumber} = 60 \\text{ pickles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many jars are needed to store the pickles:**\n   - Each jar can hold 12 pickles.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60 \\text{ pickles}}{12 \\text{ pickles per jar}} = 5 \\text{ jars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Check if Phillip has enough jars:**\n   - Phillip has 4 jars, but he needs 5 jars. Therefore, he can only use 4 jars and cannot make all 60 pickles.
