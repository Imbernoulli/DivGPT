Calculate the number of empty pages remaining after the coffee spill.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of pages remaining after the first week:**\n   Anahi wrote on 150 pages in the first week.\n   \\[\n   500 - 150 = 350\n   \\]\n   So, there are 350 pages remaining after the first week.\n\n2. **Determine how many pages Anahi wrote on in the second week:**\n   Anahi wrote on 30% of the remaining 350 pages.\n   \\[\n   0.30 \\times 350 = 105\n   \\]\n   So, she wrote on 105 pages in the second week.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of empty pages before the coffee spill:**\n   After the second week, the number of pages written on is:\n   \\[\n   150 + 105 = 255\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the number of empty pages before the coffee spill is:\n   \\[\n   500 - 255 = 245\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many empty pages were damaged by the coffee spill:**\n   The coffee spill damaged 20% of the empty pages.\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 245 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, 49 empty pages were damaged.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of empty pages remaining after the coffee spill:**\n   The number of empty pages remaining is:\n   \\[\n   245 - 49 = 196\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of empty pages available for Anahi to write on now is \\(\\boxed{196}\\).",
