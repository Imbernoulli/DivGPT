During one working day, he can deliver a maximum of 35 packages. One week, Max delivered the maximum number of packages, only twice. On two other days, Max unloaded a total of 50 packages, and on one day he unloaded only one-seventh of the maximum possible daily performance. On the last two days, the sum of the packages transported was only fourth-fifth of the maximum daily performance. How many more packages could Max deliver during that week, if he would work at maximum performance?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
