        "To determine how much the clothing store will earn if all shirts and jeans are sold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the shirts.\n2.

The store sells 20 shirts, and each shirt costs $10. Therefore, the total cost of the shirts is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ shirts} \\times \\$10 \\text{ per shirt} = \\$200 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the jeans. The store sells 10 pairs of jeans, and each pair of jeans costs twice as much as a shirt. Since each shirt costs $10, each pair of jeans costs:\n\\[ 2 \\times \\$10 = \\$20 \\]\nTherefore, the total cost of the jeans is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ pairs of jeans} \\times \\$20 \\text{ per pair} = \\$200 \\]\n\nNow, we add the total cost of the shirts and the total cost of the jeans to get the total earnings:\n\\[ \\$200 + \\$200 = \\$400 \\]\n\nThus, the clothing store will earn \\(\\boxed{400}\\) dollars if all shirts and jeans are sold.",
