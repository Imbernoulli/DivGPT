        "To determine how long it will take Hannah and her son to free her younger son, we need to calculate the total rate at which they can cut the duct tape together. Hannah can cut 8 strands per minute, and her son can cut 3 strands per minute. Therefore, their combined rate of cutting the duct tape is:\n\n\\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \\text{ strands per minute} \\]\n\nThe total number of strands of duct tape is 22. To find out how long it will take them to cut all 22 strands, we divide the total number of strands by their combined cutting rate:\n\n\\[ \\frac{22}{11} = 2 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, it will take them \\(\\boxed{2}\\) minutes to free her younger son.",
