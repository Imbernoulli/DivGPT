        "To determine how much more money Zane spent on buying the cookies than buying the Oreos, we first need to find out how many Oreos and cookies are in the box. The ratio of Oreos to cookies is given as 4:9, and the total number of items in the box is 65.\n\nLet's denote the number of Oreos by \\(4x\\) and the number of cookies by \\(9x\\). According to the problem, the sum of the number of Oreos and cookies is 65. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n4x + 9x = 65\n\\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[\n13x = 65\n\\]\nTo find the value of \\(x\\), we divide both sides of the equation by 13:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{65}{13} = 5\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the value of \\(x\\), we can find the number of Oreos and cookies:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Oreos} = 4x = 4 \\times 5 = 20\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cookies} = 9x = 9 \\times 5 = 45\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the Oreos and the total cost of the cookies. Zane bought each Oreo at $2 and each cookie at $3:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of Oreos} = 20 \\times 2 = 40\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of cookies} = 45 \\times 3 = 135\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find out how much more money Zane spent on buying the cookies than buying the Oreos by subtracting the total cost of the Oreos from the total cost of the cookies:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 135 - 40 = 95\n\\]\n\nThus, Zane spent \\(\\boxed{95}\\) dollars more on buying the cookies than buying the Oreos.",
        "To determine how much more money Zane spent on buying the cookies than buying the Oreos, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of Oreos and cookies:**\n   - The ratio of Oreos to cookies is 4:9.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of parts in the ratio.\n   - Therefore, the number of Oreos is \\( 4x \\) and the number of cookies is \\( 9x \\).\n   - The total number of items in the box is 65.
