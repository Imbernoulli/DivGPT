        "To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert minutes to hours**: Since Weng earns priced by the hour, we first need to convert the 50 minutes into hours. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour.\n\n\\[\n50 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = \\frac{50}{60} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n2. **Simplify the fraction**: Simplify \\(\\frac{50}{60}\\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{50 \\div 10}{60 \\div 10} = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n3. **Calculate earnings**: Weng earns $12 per hour. To find out how much she earned for \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) of an hour, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she worked.\n\n\\[\n12 \\text{ dollars per hour} \\times \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours} = 12 \\times \\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\n\n4. **Perform the multiplication**: Multiply 12 by \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) by multiplying the numerators and then dividing by the denominator.\n\n\\[\n12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{12 \\times 5}{6} = \\frac{60}{6} = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Weng earned \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the time from minutes to hours.\n2. Multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, we can convert 50 minutes to hours by dividing 50 by 60:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{50}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we multiply Weng's hourly wage by the number of hours she worked. Her hourly wage is $12, so we have:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours} = 12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = 12 \\times 0.8333\\ldots = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify the multiplication directly:\n\\[ 12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{12 \\times 5}{6} = \\frac{60}{6} = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Weng earned \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the time Weng babysat from minutes to hours.\n2. Multiply the number of hours by her hourly wage.\n\nFirst, let's convert 50 minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can write 50 minutes as a fraction of an hour:\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{60}\n\\]\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10:\n\\[\n\\frac{50 \\div 10}{60 \\div 10} = \\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\nSo, Weng babysat for \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) of an hour.\n\nNext, we multiply the number of hours by her hourly wage. Weng earns $12 per hour, so we multiply \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) by 12:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{6} \\times 12\n\\]\nTo multiply a fraction by a whole number, we can multiply the numerator of the fraction by the whole number and keep the denominator the same:\n\\[\n\\frac{5 \\times 12}{6} = \\frac{60}{6}\n\\]\nNow, we divide the numerator by the denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{6} = 10\n\\]\nTherefore, Weng earned \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars.",

        "To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the time from minutes to hours.\n2.

Therefore, we can convert 50 minutes to hours by dividing 50 by 60:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{50}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate Weng's earnings by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she worked.

So, we multiply:\n\\[ 12 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours} = 12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = 12 \\times 0.8333 = 10 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, Weng earned \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars.",

        "To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the time from minutes to hours.\n2. Multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours worked.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, we can convert 50 minutes to hours by dividing 50 by 60:\n\\[\n50 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{50}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours worked. Weng earns $12 per hour, so we multiply $12 by \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\):\n\\[\n12 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours} = 12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = 12 \\times 0.8333\\ldots = 10\n\\]\n\n

        "To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting for 50 minutes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the time from minutes to hours.\n2. Calculate the earnings based on the hourly rate.\n\nFirst, we know that there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, we can convert 50 minutes to hours by dividing 50 by 60:\n\\[\n50 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{50}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Weng earns $12 per hour. To find out how much she earned for \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) hours, we multiply her hourly rate by \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\):\n\\[\n12 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours} = 12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = 12 \\times 0.8333 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSo, Weng earned \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars.",

Multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked.\n\nFirst, we convert 50 minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 50 by 60:\n\\[ 50 \\div 60 = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked. Weng earns $12 per hour, so we multiply $12 by \\frac{5}{6}:\n\\[ 12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = 12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, Weng earned \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars.",

        "To determine how much Weng earned for babysitting 50 minutes, we start by noting that her hourly wage is $12. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate her earnings per minute by dividing her hourly wage by 60:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings per minute} = \\frac{12}{60} = 0.20 \\text{ dollars per minute}\n\\]\n\nNext, we multiply her earnings per minute by the number of minutes she worked, which is 50:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings} = 0.20 \\times 50 = 10 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, Weng earned \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars."
