        "To determine how much money Keaton can earn every year from his farm, we need to calculate the earnings from both the oranges and the apples separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the earnings from the oranges:\n- Keaton can harvest his oranges every 2 months.\n- There are 12 months in a year.\n- The number of times he can harvest oranges in a year is \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\).\n- Each harvest of oranges earns him $50.\n- Therefore, the total earnings from oranges in a year is \\( 6 \\times 50 = 300 \\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate the earnings from the apples:\n- Keaton can harvest his apples every 3 months.\n- There are 12 months in a year.\n- The number of times he can harvest apples in a year is \\( \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\).\n- Each harvest of apples earns him $30.\n- Therefore, the total earnings from apples in a year is \\( 4 \\times 30 = 120 \\) dollars.\n\nNow, we sum the earnings from both the oranges and the apples to find the total earnings in a year:\n\\[ 300 + 120 = 420 \\]\n\nThus, Keaton can earn \\(\\boxed{420}\\) dollars every year.",

Keaton can harvest his oranges every 2 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many times he can harvest his oranges in a year by dividing 12 by 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\nSo, Keaton can harvest his oranges 6 times in a year. Since each harvest of oranges earns him $50, the total earnings from the oranges in a year is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 50 = 300\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the earnings from the apples. Keaton can harvest his apples every 3 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many times he can harvest his apples in a year by dividing 12 by 3:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{3} = 4\n\\]\nSo, Keaton can harvest his apples 4 times in a year. Since each harvest of apples earns him $30, the total earnings from the apples in a year is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 30 = 120\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the earnings from the oranges and the apples to find out the total earnings in a year:\n\\[\n300 + 120 = 420\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Keaton can earn every year is \\boxed{420}.",
