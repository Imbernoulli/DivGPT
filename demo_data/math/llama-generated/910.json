        "To determine the total amount of money Mr. Zander paid for the construction materials, we need to calculate the cost of the cement and the cost of the sand separately, and then sum these two amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the cement:\n- Mr. Zander bought 500 bags of cement.\n- Each bag of cement costs $10.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the cement is \\( 500 \\text{ bags} \\times 10 \\text{ dollars/bag} = 5000 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the sand:\n- Mr. Zander received twenty lorries of construction sand.\n- Each lorry carries 10 tons of sand.\n- Therefore, the total amount of sand is \\( 20 \\text{ lorries} \\times 10 \\text{ tons/lorry} = 200 \\text{ tons} \\).\n- Each ton of sand costs $40.\n- Therefore, the total cost of the sand is \\( 200 \\text{ tons} \\times 40 \\text{ dollars/ton} = 8000 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\nFinally, let's sum the cost of the cement and the cost of the sand to find the total amount of money Mr. Zander paid:\n- The total cost is \\( 5000 \\text{ dollars} + 8000 \\text{ dollars} = 13000 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\nThus, the total amount of money Mr. Zander paid for these construction materials is \\(\\boxed{13000}\\).",
