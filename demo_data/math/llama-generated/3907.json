        "To determine how many people will get to ride the Ferris wheel, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total operating time of the Ferris wheel:**\n   - The Ferris wheel operates from 1:00 pm to 7:00 pm.\n   - From 1:00 pm to 7:00 pm is 6 hours.\n   - Convert hours to minutes: \\(6 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \\text{ minutes}\\).\n\n2. **Determine the frequency of the Ferris wheel's operation:**\n   - The Ferris wheel can accommodate 70 people in 20 minutes.\n   - Calculate the number of 20-minute intervals in 360 minutes: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{360 \\text{ minutes}}{20 \\text{ minutes/interval}} = 18 \\text{ intervals}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of people who can ride:**\n   - Each interval accommodates 70 people.\n   - Total number of people: \n     \\[\n     18 \\text{ intervals} \\times 70 \\text{ people/interval} = 1260 \\text{ people}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of people who will get to ride the Ferris wheel is \\(\\boxed{1260}\\).",
