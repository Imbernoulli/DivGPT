        "To determine the total amount Jim has spent on gas, we need to calculate the cost of the gas he bought in North Carolina and the cost of the gas he bought in Virginia separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the gas Jim bought in North Carolina:\n- Jim bought 10 gallons of gas.\n- The price per gallon in North Carolina is $2.00.\n- Therefore, the total cost for the gas in North Carolina is:\n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ gallons} \\times \\$2.00/\\text{gallon} = \\$20.00\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the gas Jim bought in Virginia:\n- Jim bought 10 gallons of gas.\n- The price per gallon in Virginia is $1.00 more than the price per gallon in North Carolina.

        "To determine the total amount Jim has spent on gas, we need to calculate the cost of the gas he bought in North Carolina and the cost of the gas he bought in Virginia separately, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the gas he bought in North Carolina:\n- Jim bought 10 gallons of gas.\n- The price per gallon in North Carolina is $2.00.\n\\[\n\\text{Cost in North Carolina} = 10 \\text{ gallons} \\times \\$2.00/\\text{gallon} = \\$20.00\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the gas he bought in Virginia:\n- Jim bought 10 gallons of gas.\n- The price per gallon in Virginia is $1.00 more than in North Carolina. Since the price in North Carolina is $2.00, the price in Virginia is:\n\\[\n\\$2.00 + \\$1.00 = \\$3.00/\\text{gallon}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Cost in Virginia} = 10 \\text{ gallons} \\times \\$3.00/\\text{gallon} = \\$30.00\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the costs from both states to find the total amount spent on gas:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost} = \\$20.00 + \\$30.00 = \\$50.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Jim has spent on gas is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
