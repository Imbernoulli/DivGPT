        "Let's denote the number of books Susan has as \\( S \\). According to the problem, Lidia's collection is four times bigger than Susan's collection. Therefore, Lidia has \\( 4S \\) books. The total number of books that both Susan and Lidia have together is 3000. This can be expressed with the following equation:\n\n\\[ S + 4S = 3000 \\]\n\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 5S = 3000 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( S \\), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{3000}{5} = 600 \\]\n\nSo, Susan has \\(\\boxed{600}\\) books in her collection.",
        "To determine how many books Susan has in her collection, we start by defining variables for the number of books each person has. Let \\( S \\) represent the number of books Susan has, and \\( L \\) represent the number of books Lidia has. According to the problem, Lidia's collection is four times bigger than Susan's collection, so we can express this relationship with the equation:\n\n\\[ L = 4S \\]\n\nWe are also given that the total number of books that Susan and Lidia have together is 3000. Therefore, we can write another equation:\n\n\\[ S + L = 3000 \\]\n\nNext, we substitute the expression for \\( L \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n\\[ S + 4S = 3000 \\]\n\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 5S = 3000 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( S \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{3000}{5} = 600 \\]\n\nSo, Susan has \\(\\boxed{600}\\) books in her collection. To verify, we can calculate the number of books Lidia has:\n\n\\[ L = 4S = 4 \\times 600 = 2400 \\]\n\nAdding the number of books Susan and Lidia have together, we get:\n\n\\[ S + L = 600 + 2400 = 3000 \\]\n\nThis confirms that our solution is correct. Therefore, the number of books Susan has is \\(\\boxed{600}\\).",
