        "To determine the total number of donuts Andrew's mother needs to buy, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of friends Andrew has invited. Initially, he invited two friends (Brian and Samuel), and then he invited two more friends, making a total of four friends.\n2. Andrew also wants to buy donuts for himself. Therefore, the total number of people who will get donuts is \\(4 + 1 = 5\\).\n3. Each person will get 3 donuts plus 1 extra donut as a backup, which totals \\(3 + 1 = 4\\) donuts per person.\n4. Since Andrew's mother is going to buy the same number of donuts for Andrew as for each of his friends, we multiply the total number of people by the number of donuts each person will get: \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\).\n\nThus, the total number of donuts Andrew's mother needs to buy is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
