        "To determine how many hours Mark would need to jump rope to set the record of 54,000 consecutive jumps, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of seconds required:**\n   Mark jumps 3 times per second. Therefore, to find the total number of seconds needed to complete 54,000 jumps, we divide the total number of jumps by the number of jumps per second:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total seconds} = \\frac{54,000 \\text{ jumps}}{3 \\text{ jumps/second}} = 18,000 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert seconds to hours:**\n   There are 3,600 seconds in an hour.
