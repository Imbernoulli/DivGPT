Since Sandra brought 20 pairs, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{5} = 4\n   \\]\n   So, Lisa's cousin brought 4 pairs of socks.\n\n4. **Pairs Lisa's mom brought:**\n   Lisa's mom brought 8 more than three times the number of pairs Lisa started with. Lisa started with 12 pairs, so we calculate:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 12 = 36\n   \\]\n   Adding 8 to 36, we get:\n   \\[\n   36 + 8 = 44\n   \\]\n   So, Lisa's mom brought 44 pairs of socks.\n\n5. **Total pairs of socks:**\n   Now, we add up all the pairs of socks:\n   \\[\n   12 + 20 + 4 + 44 = 80\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pairs of socks Lisa ended up with is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of pairs of socks Lisa ended up with, we need to add up the pairs she bought, the pairs her friend Sandra brought, the pairs her cousin showed up with, and the pairs her mom brought.
