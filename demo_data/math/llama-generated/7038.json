        "To determine how many hours children aged 6–11 years old watch television in 2 weeks, given they watch 45 minutes each day for 4 days a week, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of minutes watched in one week.\n2. Calculate the total number of minutes watched in 2 weeks.\n3. Convert the total minutes into hours.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes watched in one week.**\n\nThe children watch television for 45 minutes each day and they watch it 4 days a week.\n\\[\n45 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days/week} = 180 \\text{ minutes/week}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes watched in 2 weeks.**\n\nSince they watch television for 180 minutes each week, in 2 weeks they will watch:\n\\[\n180 \\text{ minutes/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 360 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert the total minutes into hours.**\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so to convert 360 minutes into hours, we divide by 60:\n\\[\n360 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 6 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours these children watch television in 2 weeks is \\boxed{6}.",
        "To determine how many hours children aged 6–11 spend watching television in 2 weeks if they are allowed to watch television 4 days a week, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.

Convert the total minutes into hours.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of minutes spent watching television in one week. Since children watch television for 45 minutes each day and they are allowed to watch television 4 days a week, we multiply the minutes per day by the number of days per week:\n\n\\[ 45 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days/week} = 180 \\text{ minutes/week} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of minutes spent watching television in 2 weeks.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:\n\n\\[ 360 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 6 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours these children watch television in 2 weeks is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",

They watch television for 45 minutes each day and are allowed to watch television 4 days a week:\n\\[ 45 \\text{ minutes/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days/week} = 180 \\text{ minutes/week} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of minutes these children watch television in two weeks:\n\\[ 180 \\text{ minutes/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 360 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the total minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total number of minutes by 60:\n\\[ 360 \\text{ minutes} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 6 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours these children watch television in 2 weeks is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
        "To determine how many hours children aged 6–11 spend watching television in 2 weeks if they are allowed to watch television 4 days a week, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the daily sending time in hours:**\n   Since children spend 45 minutes each day watching television, we need to convert minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n   \\[\n   45 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{45}{60} \\text{ hours} = 0.75 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the weekly watching time:**\n   Children watch television 4 days a week.
