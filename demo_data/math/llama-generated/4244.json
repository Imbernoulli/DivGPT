        "To determine how many eggs each hen lays a week, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of eggs sold in four weeks:**\n   Krista sold $120 worth of eggs at $3 per dozen.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total dozens of eggs sold} = \\frac{120}{3} = 40\n   \\]\n   Since each dozen contains 12 eggs, the total number of eggs sold is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total eggs sold} = 40 \\times 12 = 480\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of eggs laid by all hens in four weeks:**\n   Krista has 10 hens, and she sold all the eggs they laid. Therefore, the total number of eggs laid by all hens in four weeks is 480.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of eggs laid by all hens in one week:**\n   Since the total number of eggs laid in four weeks is 480, the number of eggs laid in one week is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Eggs laid in one week} = \\frac{480}{4} = 120\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of eggs laid by each hen in one week:**\n   Krista has 10 hens, so the number of eggs laid by each hen in one week is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Eggs laid by each hen in one week} = \\frac{120}{10} = 12\n   \\]\n\nThus, each hen lays \\(\\boxed{12}\\) eggs a week.",
