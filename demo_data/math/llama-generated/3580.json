        "To determine how much money the farmer will make from the pig's bacon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the amount of bacon the runt pig will yield.\n2. Determine the revenue from selling the bacon.\n\nFirst, we know that the average pig yields 20 pounds of bacon. Since the runt pig is only half the size of the average pig, it will yield half the amount of bacon:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 10 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money the farmer will make by selling the 10 pounds of bacon. The farmer sells each pound for $6, so the total revenue is:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ pounds} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars per pound} = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the farmer will make \\(\\boxed{60}\\) dollars from the pig's bacon.",
