        "To determine how many crayons Martha has after her purchase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how many crayons Martha has after losing half of her original crayons.\n2. Add the number of crayons she bought to the remaining crayons.\n\nFirst, Martha starts with 18 crayons. She loses half of them:\n\\[\n18 \\div 2 = 9\n\\]\nSo, Martha has 9 crayons left after losing half.\n\nNext, she buys a new set of 20 crayons. We add these 20 crayons to the 9 crayons she has left:\n\\[\n9 + 20 = 29\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of crayons Martha has after the purchase is \\boxed{29}.",
        "To determine how many crayons Martha has after her purchase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate how many crayons Martha lost.\n2. Subtract the number of lost crayons from the original number of crayons.\n3. Add the number of new crayons she bought to the remaining number of crayons.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Martha originally has 18 crayons and she lost half of them. Therefore, the number of crayons she lost is:\n\\[ \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the number of lost crayons from the original number of crayons:\n\\[ 18 - 9 = 9 \\]\n\nNow, Martha bought a new set of 20 crayons. So, we add the number of new crayons to the remaining number of crayons:\n\\[ 9 + 20 = 29 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of crayons Martha has after the purchase is:\n\\[ \\boxed{29} \\]",
