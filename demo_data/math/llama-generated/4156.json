        "To determine Christina's current age, we start by noting that in five years, her age will be half of 80 years. First, we calculate half of 80:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{80}{2} = 40\n\\]\n\nThis means that in five years, Christina will be 40 years old. To find her current age, we subtract 5 from 40:\n\n\\[\n40 - 5 = 35\n\\]\n\nSo, Christina is currently 35 years old.\n\nNext, we need to determine Oscar's current age. According to the problem, in 15 years, Oscar will be \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) times as old as Christina is now. Since Christina is currently 35 years old, we calculate \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of 35:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 35 = \\frac{3 \\times 35}{5} = \\frac{105}{5} = 21\n\\]\n\nThis means that in 15 years, Oscar will be 21 years old. To find Oscar's current age, we subtract 15 from 21:\n\n\\[\n21 - 15 = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, Oscar is currently 6 years old. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
        "To determine Christina's current age, we start by noting that in five years, Christina's age will be half of 80 years.

        "To determine Christina's current age, we start by noting that in five years, her age will be half of 80 years.
