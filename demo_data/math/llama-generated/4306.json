        "Let's define the time it took Emilio to build his house as \\( E \\) years. According to the problem, Felipe finished in half the time of Emilio, so the time it took Felipe to build his house is \\( \\frac{E}{2} \\) years. The combined time they took to build their homes is 7.5 years. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ E + \\frac{E}{2} = 7.5 \\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term in the equation by 2:\n\n\\[ 2E + E = 15 \\]\n\nCombining like terms gives:\n\n\\[ 3E = 15 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( E \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ E = 5 \\]\n\nSo, Emilio took 5 years to build his house. Since Felipe took half the time of Emilio, we can find the time it took Felipe by dividing Emilio's time by 2:\n\n\\[ \\frac{E}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \\]\n\nTherefore, Felipe took 2.5 years to build his house. To convert this time into months, we multiply by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):\n\n\\[ 2.5 \\times 12 = 30 \\]\n\nSo, it took Felipe \\(\\boxed{30}\\) months to build his house.",

        "To determine how many months it took Felipe to build his house, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the variables for the time it took each person to build their home.\n2. Set up equations based on the given information.\n3. Solve the equations to find the time it took Felipe.\n4. Convert the time from years to months.\n\nLet's start by defining the variables:\n- Let \\( E \\) be the time it took Emilio to build his house in years.\n- Since Felipe finished in half the time of Emilio, the time it took Felipe to build his house is \\( \\frac{E}{2} \\) years.\n\nAccording to the problem, the combined time for both Felipe and Emilio is 7.5 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{E}{2} + E = 7.5\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to combine the terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{E}{2} + \\frac{2E}{2} = 7.5\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{3E}{2} = 7.5\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( E \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\n3E = 15\n\\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[\nE = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, Emilio took 5 years to build his house. Since Felipe took half the time of Emilio, we calculate the time it took Felipe as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{E}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we convert 2.5 years into months. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 2.5 by 12:\n\\[\n2.5 \\times 12 = 30\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it took competit 30 months to build his house. The answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{30}\n\\]",
