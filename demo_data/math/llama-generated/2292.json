        "To determine how much Sol earns in a week, we need to calculate the total number of candy bars she sells over the six days and then convert that total into dollars. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we find the number of candy bars Sol sells each day:\n- On the first day, she sells 10 candy bars.\n- On the second day, she sells 10 + 4 = 14 candy bars.\n- On the third day, she sells 14 + 4 = 18 candy bars.\n- On the fourth day, she sells 18 + 4 = 22 candy bars.\n- On the fifth day, she sells 22 + 4 = 26 candy bars.\n- On the sixth day, she sells 26 + 4 = 30 candy bars.\n\nNext, we sum the number of candy bars sold each day to find the total number of candy bars sold in a week:\n\\[\n10 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 26 + 30\n\\]\n\nWe can add these numbers in pairs to make the calculation easier:\n\\[\n(10 + 30) + (14 + 26) + (18 + 22)\n\\]\n\\[\n40 + 40 + 40 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, Sol sells a total of 120 candy bars in a week. Since each candy bar costs 10 cents, we convert the total number of candy bars into dollars by dividing by 10:\n\\[\n120 \\div 10 = 12\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Sol earns \\(\\boxed{12}\\) dollars in a week.",
        "To determine how much Sol earns in a week, we first need to calculate the number of candy bars she sells each day and then sum them up over the six days.\n\nOn the first day, Sol sells 10 candy bars. Each subsequent day, she sells 4 more candy bars than the previous day. Therefore, the number of candy bars sold each day forms an arithmetic sequence where the first term \\(a_1\\) is 10 and the common difference \\(d\\) is 4.\n\nThe number of candy bars sold on the \\(n\\)-th day is given by the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\]\n\nWe need to find the number of candy bars sold on each of the six days:\n- On the first day (\\(n=1\\)): \\(a_1 = 10\\)\n- On the second day (\\(n=2\\)): \\(a_2 = 10 + (2-1) \\cdot 4 = 10 + 4 = 14\\)\n- On the third day (\\(n=3\\)): \\(a_3 = 10 + (3-1) \\cdot 4 = 10 + 8 = 18\\)\n- On the fourth day (\\(n=4\\)): \\(a_4 = 10 + (4-1) \\cdot 4 = 10 + 12 = 22\\)\n- On the fifth day (\\(n=5\\)): \\(a_5 = 10 + (5-1) \\cdot 4 = 10 + 16 = 26\\)\n- On the sixth day (\\(n=6\\)): \\(a_6 = 10 + (6-1) \\cdot 4 = 10 + 20 = 30\\)\n\nNext, we sum the number of candy bars sold over the six days:\n\\[10 + 14 + 18 + 22 + 26 + 30\\]\n\nWe can pair the terms to simplify the addition:\n\\[(10 + 30) + (14 + 26) + (18 + 22) = 40 + 40 + 40 = 120\\]\n\nSo, Sol sells a total of 120 candy bars in a week. Since each candy bar costs 10 cents, the total earnings in cents are:\n\\[120 \\times 10 = 1200\\]\n\nTo convert the earnings from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:\n\\[1200 \\div 100 = 12\\]\n\nTherefore, Sol earns \\(\\boxed{12}\\) dollars in a week.",
