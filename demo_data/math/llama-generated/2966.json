        "To determine the father's current age, we start by defining the variables and using the information given in the problem.\n\nLet's denote:\n- Sebastian's current age as \\( S \\).\n- Sebastian's sister's current age as \\( S_s \\).\n- Their father's current age as \\( F \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. Sebastian is 40 years old, so \\( S = 40 \\).\n2. Sebastian is 10 years older than his sister, so \\( S_s = S - 10 = 40 - 10 = 30 \\).\n\nFive years ago, Sebastian's age was \\( S - 5 = 40 - 5 = 35 \\) and his sister's age was \\( S_s - 5 = 30 - 5 = 25 \\).

So, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 60 = \\frac{3}{4} (F - 5) \\]\n\nTo find \\( F \\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:\n\\[ 60 \\times 4 = 3(F - 5) \\]\n\\[ 240 = 3(F - 5) \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 3:\n\\[ \\frac{240}{3} = F - 5 \\]\n\\[ 80 = F - 5 \\]\n\nFinally, we add 5 to both sides to solve for \\( F \\):\n\\[ F = 80 + 5 \\]\n\\[ F = 85 \\]\n\nThus, the father's current age is \\(\\boxed{85}\\).",
