Once there, people pick as many strawberries as they wish, and then take them to Miguel for weighing and pricing. This year, the standard price of a pound of strawberries is $20. Miguel is a very generous man. He deducts the entrance charge from the cost of the harvest. Sally, Jenny and Moses have just finished their strawberry picking and are headed home. They paid $128 for their harvest. How many pounds of strawberry did they pick?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Since there are three pickers (Sally, Jenny, and Moses), the total entrance charge is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4 = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total cost of the strawberries before the entrance charge deduction:**\n   The total amount paid by Sally, Jenny, and Moses after the entrance charge deduction is $128. Since the entrance charge is $12, the total cost of the strawberries before the deduction is:\n   \\[\n   128 + 12 = 140 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total weight of the strawberries picked:**\n   The standard price of a pound of strawberries is $20. Therefore, the total weight of the strawberries picked is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{140}{20} = 7 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pounds of strawberries that Sally, Jenny, and Moses picked is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
