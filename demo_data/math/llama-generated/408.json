To find Tamara's height, we substitute \\( k = 24 \\) back into the expression for Tamara's height:\n\\[\n3k - 4 = 3(24) - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Tamara's height is \\(\\boxed{68}\\) inches.",
        "Let's define the height of Kim as \\( k \\) inches. According to the problem, Tamara's height is 3 times Kim's height less 4 inches. Therefore, we can express Tamara's height as \\( 3k - 4 \\) inches.\n\nThe problem also states that the combined height of Tamara and Kim is 92 inches. So, we can write the equation:\n\\[\nk + (3k - 4) = 92\n\\]\n\nFirst, combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\\[\nk + 3k - 4 = 92\n\\]\n\\[\n4k - 4 = 92\n\\]\n\nNext, add 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( k \\):\n\\[\n4k - 4 + 4 = 92 + 4\n\\]\n\\[\n4k = 96\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \\( k \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{4k}{4} = \\frac{96}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nk = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, Kim's height is 24 inches. To find Tamara's height, substitute \\( k = 24 \\) back into the expression for Tamara's height:\n\\[\n3k - 4 = 3(24) - 4\n\\]\n\\[\n3(24) - 4 = 72 - 4\n\\]\n\\[\n72 - 4 = 68\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Tamara's height is \\(\\boxed{68}\\) inches."
