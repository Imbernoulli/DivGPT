        "To determine how many tons the tongue of an adult blue whale can weigh, we start with the given weight in pounds and convert it to tons. We know that one ton is equal to 2000 pounds. Therefore, we can use the following conversion factor:\n\n\\[ 1 \\text{ ton} = 2000 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nThe weight of the tongue is given as 6000 pounds. To convert this weight to tons, we divide the weight in pounds by the number of pounds in a ton:\n\n\\[ 6000 \\text{ pounds} \\div 2000 \\text{ pounds/ton} = 3 \\text{ tons} \\]\n\nThus, the tongue of an adult blue whale can weigh \\(\\boxed{3}\\) tons.",
