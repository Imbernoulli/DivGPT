        "To determine how many of the hybrids in the car dealership have full headlights, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hybrid cars in the dealership.\n2. Determine how many of these hybrid cars have only one headlight.\n3. Subtract the number of hybrids with only one headlight from the total number of hybrids to find the number of hybrids with full headlights.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hybrid cars in the dealership.\n   The dealership has 600 cars, and 60% of them are hybrids.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of hybrid cars} = 600 \\times 0.60 = 360\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine how many of these hybrid cars have only one headlight.\n   40% of the hybrid cars have only one headlight.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of hybrids with only one headlight} = 360 \\times 0.40 = 144\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract the number of hybrids with only one headlight from the total number of hybrids to find the number of hybrids with full headlights.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of hybrids with full headlights} = 360 - 144 = 216\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of hybrids that have full headlights is \\(\\boxed{216}\\).",

Subtract the number of hybrid cars with only one headlight from the total number of hybrid cars to find the number of hybrid cars with full headlights.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of hybrid cars. Since 60% of the 600 cars are hybrids, we have:\n\\[\n0.60 \\times 600 = 360\n\\]\nSo, there are 360 hybrid cars.\n\nNext, we determine the number of hybrid cars with only one headlight. Since 40% of the hybrid cars have only one headlight, we have:\n\\[\n0.40 \\times 360 = 144\n\\]\nSo, there are 144 hybrid cars with only one headlight.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of hybrid cars with only one headlight from the total number of hybrid cars to find the number of hybrid cars with full headlights:\n\\[\n360 - 144 = 216\n\\]\nSo, the number of hybrid cars with full headlights is \\boxed{216}.",
