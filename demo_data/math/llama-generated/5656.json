        "To determine how many bundles of wood were burned in the afternoon, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of bundles of wood burned during the day.\n2. Subtract the number of bundles burned in the morning from the total number burned to find the number burned in the afternoon.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of bundles of wood burned during the day. We start with 10 bundles and end with 3 bundles, so the total number burned is:\n\\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \\text{ bundles} \\]\n\nNext, we know that 4 bundles were burned in the morning.
