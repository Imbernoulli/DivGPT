From the second equation, we have \\( A = \\frac{1}{3}J \\), and from the third equation, we have \\( C = 2A = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{3}J \\right) = \\frac{2}{3}J \\). Substituting these into the first equation gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}J + J + \\frac{2}{3}J = 132\n\\]\n\nTo combine the terms on the left side, we find a common denominator, which is 3:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}J + \\frac{3}{3}J + \\frac{2}{3}J = \\frac{6}{3}J = 2J\n\\]\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\\[\n2J = 132\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( J \\), we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nJ = \\frac{132}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Jeremy is \\(\\boxed{66}\\) years old.",
