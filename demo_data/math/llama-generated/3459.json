        "To determine how many cookies Paul took out in four days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cookies Paul took out over the week.\n2. Determine how many cookies Paul took out each day.\n3. Calculate the number of cookies Paul took out in four days.\n\nFirst, we find out how many cookies Paul took out over the week. Initially, there were 70 cookies, and after a week, there are 28 cookies left. So, the number of cookies taken out is:\n\\[ 70 - 28 = 42 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many cookies Paul took out each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of cookies taken out by 7:\n\\[ 42 \\div 7 = 6 \\]\n\nThis means Paul took out 6 cookies each day. To find out how many cookies he took out in four days, we multiply the number of cookies he took out each day by 4:\n\\[ 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies Paul took out in four days is:\n\\[ \\boxed{24} \\]",
