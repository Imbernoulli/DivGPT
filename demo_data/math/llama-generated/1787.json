        "To determine the total number of birds the bird watcher saw from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of birds he saw each day and then sum these amounts.\n\n1. **Monday:**\n   The bird watcher sees 70 birds.\n\n2. **Tuesday:**\n   He sees half as many birds as he did on Monday. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{70}{2} = 35\n   \\]\n   So, he sees 35 birds on Tuesday.\n\n3. **Wednesday:**\n   He sees 8 more birds than he did on Tuesday. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   35 + 8 = 43\n   \\]\n   So, he sees 43 birds on Wednesday.\n\n4. **Total:**\n   To find the total number of birds seen from Monday to Wednesday, we sum the number of birds seen each day:\n   \\[\n   70 + 35 + 43\n   \\]\n\n   Let's add these step by step:\n   \\[\n   70 + 35 = 105\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   105 + 43 = 148\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the total number of birds the bird watcher saw from Monday to Wednesday is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{148}\n   \\]",
        "To determine the total number of birds the bird watcher saw from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of birds he saw each day and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many birds he saw on Tuesday.

        "To determine the total number of birds the bird watcher saw from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of birds he saw each day and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of birds he saw on Tuesday. According to the problem, he saw half as many birds on Tuesday as he did on Monday. Since he saw 70 birds on Monday, we can find the number of birds he saw on Tuesday by dividing 70 by 2:\n\\[\n70 \\div 2 = 35\n\\]\nSo, he saw 35 birds on Tuesday.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of birds he saw on Wednesday. The problem states that he saw 8 more birds on Wednesday than he did on Tuesday. Since he saw 35 birds on Tuesday, we can find the number of birds he saw on Wednesday by adding 8 to 35:\n\\[\n35 + 8 = 43\n\\]\nSo, he saw 43 birds on Wednesday.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of birds he saw over the three days.
