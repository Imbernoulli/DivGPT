        "To determine how many more marbles Lisa has after Cindy gives her 12 marbles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find out how many marbles Lisa originally had:**\n   Cindy has 20 marbles, which is 5 more than what Lisa had. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   C = L + 5\n   \\]\n   where \\( C \\) is the number of marbles Cindy has and \\( L \\) is the number of marbles Lisa has.\n\n   Given \\( C = 20 \\), we substitute this value into the equation:\n   \\[\n   20 = L + 5\n   \\]\n\n   To solve for \\( L \\), subtract 5 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   L = 20 - 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L = 15\n   \\]\n\n   So, Lisa originally had 15 marbles.\n\n2. **Determine how many marbles Cindy has after giving 12 marbles to Lisa:**\n   Cindy starts with 20 marbles and gives 12 to Lisa. Therefore, the number of marbles Cindy has left is:\n   \\[\n   C_{\\text{new}} = 20 - 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   C_{\\text{new}} = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many marbles Lisa has after receiving 12 marbles from Cindy:**\n   Lisa starts with 15 marbles and receives 12 more from Cindy. Therefore, the number of marbles Lisa has now is:\n   \\[\n   L_{\\text{new}} = 15 + 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_{\\text{new}} = 27\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find out how many more marbles Lisa has now compared to Cindy:**\n   Lisa now has 27 marbles, and Cindy now has 8 marbles. The difference in the number of marbles is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = L_{\\text{new}} - C_{\\text{new}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 27 - 8\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 19\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Lisa has \\(\\boxed{19}\\) more marbles now than Cindy.",
        "First, we need to determine how many marbles Lisa originally had. We know that Cindy had 20 marbles, which is 5 more than what Lisa had. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Lisa had:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Lisa's marbles} = 20 - 5 = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many marbles each of them has after Cindy gives Lisa 12 marbles.

Therefore, we can express the number of marbles Lisa had as:\n\\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \\]\nSo, Lisa originally had 15 marbles.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate how many marbles Cindy has after giving 12 marbles to Lisa.**\n\nCindy originally has 20 marbles and she gives 12 marbles to Lisa. Therefore, the number of marbles Cindy has left is:\n\\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \\]\nSo, Cindy now has 8 marbles.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many marbles Lisa has after receiving 12 marbles from Cindy.**\n\nLisa originally has 15 marbles and she receives 12 marbles from Cindy. Therefore, the number of marbles Lisa has now is:\n\\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \\]\nSo, Lisa now has 27 marbles.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the difference in the number of marbles between Cindy and Lisa after the transaction.**\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more marbles Lisa has than Cindy. We do this by subtracting the number of marbles Cindy has from the number of marbles Lisa has:\n\\[ 27 - 8 = 19 \\]\nSo, Lisa has 19 more marbles than Cindy now.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{19}\n\\]",
