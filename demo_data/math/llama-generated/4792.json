        "To determine how much Liam and Claire are going to save for their mother's birthday gift, we need to calculate the total amount of money each of them made from selling their oranges and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much Liam made. Liam picked 40 oranges and sold them at $2.50 for every 2 oranges. Therefore, we need to find out how many sets of 2 oranges are in 40 oranges:\n\\[ \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\]\nSince each set of 2 oranges is sold for $2.50, the total amount Liam made is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 2.50 = 50 \\]\nSo, Liam made $50.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much Claire made. Claire picked 30 oranges and sold them at $1.20 each. Therefore, the total amount Claire made is:\n\\[ 30 \\times 1.20 = 36 \\]\nSo, Claire made $36.\n\nTo find out the total amount they are going to save for their mother's birthday gift, we add the amounts Liam and Claire made:\n\\[ 50 + 36 = 86 \\]\nSo, the total amount they are going to save is:\n\\[ \\boxed{86} \\]",
