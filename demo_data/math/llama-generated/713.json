To find Mr. Bernard's current age, subtract 8 from 60:\n\\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \\]\nTherefore, Mr. Bernard is currently 52 years old.\n\nNext, find the average of their current ages:\n\\[ \\text{Average age} = \\frac{\\text{Luke's age} + \\text{Mr. Bernard's age}}{2} = \\frac{20 + 52}{2} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36 \\]\n\nFinally, subtract 10 from the average age:\n\\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \\]\n\nSo, 10 years less than their average age is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).",

So, in eight years, Mr. Bernard will be:\n\\[ \\text{Mr. Bernard's age in 8 years} = 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\]\n\nSince this is Mr. Bernard's age in eight years, his current age is:\n\\[ \\text{Mr. Bernard's current age} = 60 - 8 = 52 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate their average age.**\n\nNow we need to find the average of Mr. Bernard's current age and Luke's current age. The average age is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Average age} = \\frac{\\text{Mr. Bernard's current age} + \\text{Luke's current age}}{2} = \\frac{52 + 20}{2} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find 10 years less than their average age.**\n\nFinally, we need to find 10 years less than their average age:\n\\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \\]\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{26} \\]",

According to the problem, Luke is 20 years old.\n\nNext, we know that in eight years, Mr. Bernard will be 3 times as old as Luke is now.
