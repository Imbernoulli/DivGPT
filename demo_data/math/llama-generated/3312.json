        "To determine how much money Melissa made from her sales, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the price of the SUV.\n2. Find the total sales amount for both the coupe and the SUV.\n3. Calculate Melissa's commission based on the total sales amount.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the price of the SUV.**\n\nThe price of the SUV is twice the price of the coupe. The price of the coupe is $30,000.\n\\[\n\\text{Price of the SUV} = 2 \\times 30,000 = 60,000\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Find the total sales amount for both the coupe and the SUV.**\n\nAdd the price of the coupe and the price of the SUV.\n\\[\n\\text{Total sales amount} = 30,000 + 60,000 = 90,000\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Melissa's commission based on the total sales amount.**\n\nMelissa's commission is 2% of the total sales amount. To find 2% of $90,000, multiply $90,000 by 0.02.\n\\[\n\\text{Commission} = 90,000 \\times 0.02 = 1,800\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Melissa made from these sales is \\(\\boxed{1800}\\).",

Find the total sales amount from both the coupe and the SUV.\n3. Calculate Melissa's commission, which is 2% of the total sales amount.\n\nFirst, let's find the price of the SUV. The SUV costs twice as much as the coupe. Since the coupe is priced at $30,000, we can calculate the price of the SUV as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Price of the SUV} = 2 \\times 30,000 = 60,000\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the total sales amount by adding the price of the coupe and the price of the SUV:\n\\[\n\\text{Total sales amount} = 30,000 + 60,000 = 90,000\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate Melissa's commission, which is 2% of the total sales amount. To find 2% of $90,000, we multiply $90,000 by 0.02:\n\\[\n\\text{Commission} = 90,000 \\times 0.02 = 1,800\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Melissa made from these sales is \\boxed{1800}.",

Since the coupe is priced at $30,000, the price of the SUV is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 30,000 = 60,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Find the total sales amount.**\nThe total sales amount is the sum of the price of the coupe and the price of the SUV:\n\\[ 30,000 + 60,000 = 90,000 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Melissa's commission.**\nMelissa's commission is 2% of the total sales amount. To find 2% of $90,000, we multiply $90,000 by 0.02:\n\\[ 90,000 \\times 0.02 = 1,800 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Melissa made from these sales is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1800} \\]",
