Since he makes 6 drums of paint each day, the number of days required to make 360 drums is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{360 \\text{ drums}}{6 \\text{ drums per day}} = 60 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take him \\boxed{60} days to make 360 drums of paint.",
        "To determine how many days it will take for the paint mixer to make 360 drums of paint, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the daily production rate:**\n   The paint mixer makes 18 drums of paint in 3 days. To find the daily production rate, we divide the total number of drums by the number of days:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily production rate} = \\frac{18 \\text{ drums}}{3 \\text{ days}} = 6 \\text{ drums per day}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total number of days needed to produce 360 drums:**\n   Now that we know the daily production rate is 6 drums per day, we can find out how many days it will take to produce 360 drums by dividing the total number of drums by the daily production rate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total days} = \\frac{360 \\text{ drums}}{6 \\text{ drums per day}} = 60 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take the paint mixer \\boxed{60} days to make 360 drums of paint."
