After paying $1800, he still owes $2000 on his new car. Therefore, the total cost of the new car can be expressed as the sum of the amount he paid and the amount he still owes:\n\n\\[ 2x = 1800 + 2000 \\]\n\nNow, we can simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x = 3800 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{3800}{2} = 1900 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of Ben's old car is \\(\\boxed{1900}\\) dollars.",

        "Let's denote the cost of Ben's old car as \\( x \\) dollars. According to the problem, the cost of Ben's new car is twice the cost of his old car, so the cost of the new car is \\( 2x \\) dollars.\n\nBen sold his old car for $1800 and used that to pay off some of the cost of his new car. After paying with the $1800, he still owes $2000 on his new car. This means that the total cost of the new car can be expressed as the sum of the $1800 he paid and the $2000 he still owes.
