        "To determine the total amount Andre paid for the treadmill and plates, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discounted price of the treadmill.\n2. Calculate the total cost of the plates.\n3. Add the discounted price of the treadmill to the total cost of the plates.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the treadmill.**\n\nThe original price of the treadmill is $1350, and it is sold at a 30% discount. First, we find the amount of the discount:\n\\[ 1350 \\times 0.30 = 405 \\]\nSo, the discounted price of the treadmill is:\n\\[ 1350 - 405 = 945 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the plates.**\n\nAndre bought 2 pieces of 45-pound plates, and each plate costs $50. Therefore, the total cost of the plates is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the discounted price of the treadmill to the total cost of the plates.**\n\nNow, we add the discounted price of the treadmill to the total cost of the plates:\n\\[ 945 + 100 = 1045 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount Andre paid for the treadmill and plates is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1045} \\]",
        "To determine the total amount Andre paid for the treadmill and plates, we need to calculate the discounted price of the treadmill and the total cost of the plates, and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discounted price of the treadmill. The original price of the treadmill is $1350, and it is sold at a 30% discount. A 30% discount means Andre pays 70% of the original price. We can calculate this as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Discounted price of the treadmill} = 1350 \\times (1 - 0.30) = 1350 \\times 0.70 = 945\n\\]\nSo, Andre paid $945 for the treadmill.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the two 45-pound plates. Each plate costs $50, and Andre bought two of them. Therefore, the total cost of the plates is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of the plates} = 2 \\times 50 = 100\n\\]\nSo, Andre paid $100 for the plates.\n\nNow, we add the discounted price of the treadmill and the total cost of the plates to find the total amount Andre paid:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount paid} = 945 + 100 = 1045\n\\]\nTherefore, the total amount Andre paid for the treadmill and plates is \\boxed{1045}.",

To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 30% (or 0.30):\n\n\\[ 1350 \\times 0.30 = 405 \\]\n\nSo, the discount on the treadmill is $405.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the price of the treadmill after the discount.**\n\nTo find the price of the treadmill after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:\n\n\\[ 1350 - 405 = 945 \\]\n\nSo, the price of the treadmill after the discount is $945.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the plates.**\n\nAndre bought 2 pieces of 45-pound plates, and each plate costs $50. To find the total cost of the plates, we multiply the number of plates by the cost per plate:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\]\n\nSo, the total cost of the plates is $100.\n\n**Step 4: Add the discounted price of the treadmill to the total cost of the plates.**\n\nTo find the total amount Andre paid, we add the price of the treadmill after the discount to the total cost of the plates:\n\n\\[ 945 + 100 = 1045 \\]\n\nSo, the total amount Andre paid for the treadmill and the plates is \\(\\boxed{1045}\\).",
        "To determine the total amount Andre paid for the treadmill and plates, we need to calculate the discounted price of the treadmill and the total cost of the plates, then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discounted price of the treadmill. The original price of the treadmill is $1350, and it is being sold at a 30% discount. The discount amount can be calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Discount amount} = 1350 \\times \\frac{30}{100} = 1350 \\times 0.30 = 405\n\\]\nSo, the price of the treadmill after the discount is:\n\\[\n\\text{Discounted price of the treadmill} = 1350 - 405 = 945\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 pieces of 45-pound plates. Each plate costs $50, so the total cost for 2 plates is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total cost of the plates} = 2 \\times 50 = 100\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the discounted price of the treadmill and the total cost of the plates to find the total amount Andre paid:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount paid} = 945 + 100 = 1045\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Andre paid for the treadmill and plates is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1045}\n\\]",

First, we find out what 30% of $1350 is.\n   \\[\n   0.30 \\times 1350 = 405\n   \\]\n   This means the discount amount is $405. To find the sale price of the treadmill, we subtract the discount from the original price:\n   \\[\n   1350 - 405 = 945\n   \\]\n   So, the sale price of the treadmill is $945.\n\n2. Calculate the total cost of the plates:\n   Andre bought 2 pieces of 45-pound plates, and each plate costs $50. Therefore, the total cost for the plates is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 50 = 100\n   \\]\n   So, the total cost of the plates is $100.\n\n3. Add the cost of the treadmill and the plates to find the total amount Andre paid:\n   \\[\n   945 + 100 = 1045\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount Andre paid for the treadmill and plates is \\(\\boxed{1045}\\).",

We can find 70% of $1350 by multiplying $1350 by 0.70:\n\n\\[\n1350 \\times 0.70 = 945\n\\]\n\nSo, the discounted price of the treadmill is $945.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the plates. Andre bought 2 pieces of 45-pound plates, and each plate costs $50. Therefore, the total cost of the plates is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 50 = 100\n\\]\n\nSo, the total cost of the plates is $100.\n\nNow, we add the discounted price of the treadmill and the total cost of the plates to find out how much Andre paid in total:\n\n\\[\n945 + 100 = 1045\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Andre paid \\(\\boxed{1045}\\) dollars for the treadmill and plates.",

Finally, we add the discounted price of the treadmill to the total cost of the plates to find the total amount Andre paid.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount paid} = 945 + 100 = 1045\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Andre paid for the treadmill and plates is \\(\\boxed{1045}\\).",
        "To determine the total amount Andre paid for the treadmill and the plates, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discount on the treadmill.\n2. Determine the cost of the treadmill after the discount.\n3. Calculate the total cost of the plates.\n4. Add the cost of the treadmill after the discount to the total cost of the plates.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discount on the treadmill. The original price of the treadmill is $1350, and it is sold at a 30% discount. Therefore, the discount amount is:\n\\[ 1350 \\times 0.30 = 405 \\]\nSubtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of the treadmill:\n\\[ 1350 - 405 = 945 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the plates. Andre bought 2 pieces of 45-pound plates, and each plate costs $50. Therefore, the total cost of the plates is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the cost of the treadmill after the discount to the total cost of the plates to find the total amount Andre paid:\n\\[ 945 + 100 = 1045 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Andre paid for the treadmill and the plates is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1045} \\]",

        "To determine how much Andre paid for the treadmill and the plates, we need to calculate the discounted price of the treadmill and the total cost of the plates, then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discounted price of the treadmill. The original price of the treadmill is $1350, and it is being sold at a 30% discount. A 30% discount means Andre pays 70% of the original price. We can find 70% of $1350 by multiplying $1350 by 0.70:\n\n\\[\n1350 \\times 0.70 = 945\n\\]\n\nSo, the discounted price of the treadmill is $945.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of the two 45-pound plates. Each plate costs $50, and Andre bought 2 plates. Therefore, the total cost of the plates is:\n\n\\[\n50 \\times 2 = 100\n\\]\n\nSo, the total cost of the plates is $100.\n\nNow, we add the discounted price of the treadmill and the total cost of the plates to find out how much Andre paid for both items:\n\n\\[\n945 + 100 = 1045\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Andre paid \\(\\boxed{1045}\\) dollars for the treadmill and the plates."
