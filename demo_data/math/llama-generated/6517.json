        "To determine the number of violins in Francis' family, we start by calculating the total number of strings for the ukuleles and guitars. We know that each ukulele has 4 strings and there are 2 ukuleles, so the total number of strings for the ukuleles is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\text{ strings} \\]\n\nNext, we know that each guitar has 6 strings and there are 4 guitars, so the total number of strings for the guitars is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\text{ strings} \\]\n\nLet the number of violins be denoted by \\( v \\). Each violin has 4 strings, so the total number of strings for the violins is:\n\n\\[ 4v \\text{ strings} \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of strings among the ukuleles, guitars, and violins is 40 strings. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\n\\[ 8 + 24 + 4v = 40 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 32 + 4v = 40 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( v \\), we subtract 32 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 4v = 8 \\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ v = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the number of violins Francis' family has is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
