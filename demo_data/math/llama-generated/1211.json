        "To determine how long it will take Rodney and Todd to row to the point where the river is 80 yards wide, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the rate of change of the river's width:**\n   The river's width increases by 2 yards every 10 meters. Therefore, the rate of change of the river's width is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2 \\text{ yards}}{10 \\text{ meters}} = 0.2 \\text{ yards per meter}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total increase in the river's width:**\n   The river's width starts at 50 yards and needs to increase to 80 yards. The total increase in width is:\n   \\[\n   80 \\text{ yards} - 50 \\text{ yards} = 30 \\text{ yards}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the distance along the river required for the width to increase by 30 yards:**\n   Since the river's width increases at a rate of 0.2 yards per meter, the distance \\(d\\) along the river needed for a 30-yard increase is:\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{30 \\text{ yards}}{0.2 \\text{ yards per meter}} = 150 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the time taken to row 150 meters:**\n   Rodney and Todd row at a rate of 5 meters per second. Therefore, the time \\(t\\) it takes to row 150 meters is:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{150 \\text{ meters}}{5 \\text{ meters per second}} = 30 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\nThus, it will take Rodney and Todd \\(\\boxed{30}\\) seconds to get to the point where the river is 80 yards wide.",
        "To determine how long it will take Rodney and Todd to row to the point where the river is 80 yards wide, we first need to find out how far they need to row along the river to reach that point.\n\nThe width of the river increases uniformly by 2 yards every 10 meters. We can express this relationship with a linear equation where the width \\( w \\) (in yards) is a function of the distance \\( x \\) (in meters) along the river. The initial width of the river is 50 yards, and it increases by 2 yards for every 10 meters, which is equivalent to an increase of 0.2 yards per meter. Therefore, the equation for the width of the river is:\n\\[ w = 50 + 0.2x \\]\n\nWe need to find the distance \\( x \\) when the width \\( w \\) is 80 yards. Substituting 80 for \\( w \\) in the equation, we get:\n\\[ 80 = 50 + 0.2x \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first subtract 50 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 30 = 0.2x \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 0.2:\n\\[ x = \\frac{30}{0.2} = 150 \\]\n\nSo, Rodney and Todd need to row 150 meters to reach the point where the river is 80 yards wide. Since they row at a rate of 5 meters per second, the time \\( t \\) (in seconds) it takes them to row 150 meters is:\n\\[ t = \\frac{150}{5} = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, the time it takes them to get to the point where the river is 80 yards wide is \\(\\boxed{30}\\) seconds.",
