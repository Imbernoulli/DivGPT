Each pencil costs $4, so the total cost for the pencils is:\n\\[\n1200 \\times 4 = 4800 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for the pens. Each pen costs $5, so the total cost for the pens is:\n\\[\n2700 \\times 5 = 13500 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the total amount of money paid for all the stationery by adding the cost of the pencils and the cost of the pens:\n\\[\n4800 + 13500 = 18300 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money the store paid for the stationery is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{18300}\n\\]",
