Apply the discount to find the final cost.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the car washes without the discount. Since each car wash normally costs $15, and Jim bought 20 car washes, the total cost is:\n\\[\n20 \\times 15 = 300 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, since Jim only has to pay 60% of the total cost (because he bought a package), we need to find 60% of $300. This can be done by multiplying $300 by 0.60:\n\\[\n300 \\times 0.60 = 180 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Jim paid for the package is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{180}\n\\]",

        "To determine how much Jim paid for the package of 20 car washes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of 20 car washes at the normal price.\n2. Determine the discount Jim received by paying only 60% of the normal price.\n3. Calculate the final amount Jim paid.\n\nFirst, let's find the total cost of 20 car washes at the normal price. The normal price for one car wash is $15, so:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ car washes} \\times \\$15 \\text{ per car wash} = \\$300 \\]\n\nNext, since Jim only has to pay 60% of the normal price, we need to calculate 60% of $300. To do this, we multiply $300 by 0.60:\n\\[ \\$300 \\times 0.60 = \\$180 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Jim paid for the package is:\n\\[ \\boxed{180} \\]",
