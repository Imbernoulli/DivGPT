        "To determine Jonessa's take-home pay, we need to calculate how much of her pay goes to taxes and then subtract that amount from her total pay.\n\n1. **Calculate the tax amount:**\n   Jonessa pays 10% of her pay in taxes. First, we convert the percentage to a decimal:\n   \\[\n   10\\% = 0.10\n   \\]\n\n   Next, we multiply her total pay by this decimal to find the tax amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tax amount} = 0.10 \\times 500\n   \\]\n\n   Performing the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tax amount} = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the take-home pay:**\n   To find Jonessa's take-home pay, we subtract the tax amount from her total pay:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Take-home pay} = 500 - 50\n   \\]\n\n   Performing the subtraction:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Take-home pay} = 450\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jonessa's take-home pay is \\(\\boxed{450}\\).",
