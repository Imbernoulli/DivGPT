        "To determine the total number of doves Giselle has now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the doves:**\n   Each dove lays 3 eggs.

Determine how many of these eggs hatched.\n3. Add the number of hatched eggs to the original number of doves.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the doves.**\n\nGiselle started with 20 female doves, and each dove laid 3 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs laid is:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ doves} \\times 3 \\text{ eggs per dove} = 60 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many of these eggs hatched.**\n\nWe know that \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the eggs hatched. So, we need to calculate \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of 60:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} \\times 60 = \\frac{3 \\times 60}{4} = \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the number of hatched eggs to the original number of doves.**\n\nThe original number of doves was 20, and 45 new doves hatched. Therefore, the total number of doves now is:\n\\[ 20 + 45 = 65 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of doves Giselle has now is \\(\\boxed{65}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of doves Giselle has now, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the doves.\n2. Determine how many of those eggs hatched.\n3. Add the number of hatched eggs to the original number of doves.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of eggs laid by the doves. Since each of the 20 female doves laid 3 eggs, we multiply 20 by 3:\n\\[\n20 \\times 3 = 60\n\\]\nSo, the total number of eggs laid is 60.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these eggs hatched. Since 3/4 of the eggs hatched, we multiply 60 by 3/4:\n\\[\n60 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 60 \\times 0.75 = 45\n\\]\nSo, the number of eggs that hatched is 45.\n\nFinally, we add the number of hatched eggs to the original number of doves. The original number of doves was 20, so we add 45 to 20:\n\\[\n20 + 45 = 65\n\\]\nTherefore, the total number of doves Giselle has now is \\boxed{65}."
