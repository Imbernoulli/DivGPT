The bill is $26. So, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.05 \\times 26 = 1.30\n\\]\nGina tipped $1.30.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount a good tipper would tip. A good tipper tips at least 20% of the bill. So, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.20 \\times 26 = 5.20\n\\]\nA good tipper would tip $5.20.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the good tipper's tip and Gina's tip:\n\\[\n5.20 - 1.30 = 3.90\n\\]\nThe difference is $3.90. Since we need to find out how many more cents Gina would have to tip, we convert $3.90 to cents:\n\\[\n3.90 \\times 100 = 390\n\\]\nTherefore, Gina would have to tip \\(\\boxed{390}\\) more cents to be considered a good tipper.",

Gina tipped 5% of $26.

Calculate the amount a good tipper would tip.\n3. Find the difference between the amount a good tipper would tip and the amount Gina tipped.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount Gina tipped. Gina tipped 5% of the bill, so we have:\n\\[ 5\\% \\text{ of } \\$26 = 0.05 \\times 26 = \\$1.30 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount a good tipper would tip. A good tipper tips at least 20%, so we have:\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } \\$26 = 0.20 \\times 26 = \\$5.20 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the amount a good tipper would tip and the amount Gina tipped:\n\\[ \\$5.20 - \\$1.30 = \\$3.90 \\]\n\nSince we need the answer in cents, we convert \\$3.90 to cents:\n\\[ \\$3.90 = 390 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nTherefore, Gina would have to tip \\(\\boxed{390}\\) more cents to be considered a good tipper.",

Calculate the amount a good tipper would tip.\n3. Find the difference between the good tipper's tip and Gina's tip.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount Gina tipped. Gina tipped 5% of a $26 bill. Therefore, we multiply $26 by 5% (or 0.05):\n\\[\n26 \\times 0.05 = 1.30\n\\]\nSo, Gina tipped $1.30.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount a good tipper would tip. A good tipper tips at least 20% of the bill. Therefore, we multiply $26 by 20% (or 0.20):\n\\[\n26 \\times 0.20 = 5.20\n\\]\nSo, a good tipper would tip $5.20.\n\nNow, we find the difference between the good tipper's tip and Gina's tip:\n\\[\n5.20 - 1.30 = 3.90\n\\]\nSo, Gina would need to tip $3.90 more to be considered a good tipper. Since the question asks for the answer in cents, we convert $3.90 to cents by multiplying by 100:\n\\[\n3.90 \\times 100 = 390\n\\]\nTherefore, Gina would need to tip \\boxed{390} more cents to be considered a good tipper.",
