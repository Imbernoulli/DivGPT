To find the average, we sum these grades and then divide by the number of grades.\n\n\\[\n90 + 80 + 70 + 100 = 340\n\\]\n\nThere are 4 grades, so we divide 340 by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{340}{4} = 85\n\\]\n\nSo, Janet's semester 1 average is 85.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Janet's semester 2 average.**\n\nWe are given that Janet's semester 2 average is 82.\n\n**Step 3: Find the difference between the semester 1 average and the semester 2 average.**\n\nWe subtract the semester 2 average from the semester 1 average:\n\n\\[\n85 - 82 = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, Janet's semester 1 average was 3 percent higher than her semester 2 average. The final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",
