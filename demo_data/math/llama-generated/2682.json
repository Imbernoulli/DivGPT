Therefore, the total number of meals he buys over the project is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ meals/week} \\times 16 \\text{ weeks} = 320 \\text{ meals}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost of the meals:**\n   Each meal costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 320 meals is:\n   \\[\n   320 \\text{ meals} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars/meal} = 1280 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount Herman will spend on breakfast over the course of the project is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1280}\n\\]",
        "To determine how much Herman will spend on breakfast over the course of the project, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the daily cost of breakfast.\n2. Determine the weekly cost of breakfast.\n3. Calculate the total cost for the entire project.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the daily cost of breakfast.**\n\nHerman buys a breakfast combo for himself and 3 members of his team, so he buys a total of 4 breakfast combos each day. Each meal costs $4.00, so the daily cost is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ combos/day} \\times \\$4.00/\\text{combo} = \\$16.00/\\text{day} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the weekly cost of breakfast.**\n\nHerman stops at the drive-through 5 days each week, so the weekly cost is:\n\\[ \\$16.00/\\text{day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = \\$80.00/\\text{week} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the entire project.**\n\nThe project will last 16 weeks, so the total cost is:\n\\[ \\$80.00/\\text{week} \\times 16 \\text{ weeks} = \\$1280.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Herman will spend on breakfast is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1280} \\]",
