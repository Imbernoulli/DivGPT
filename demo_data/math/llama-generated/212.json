        "To determine how many weeks it will take Daria to raise enough money to buy the vacuum cleaner, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Amount$:**\n   Daria has already collected $20 in her piggy bank.\n\n2. **Weekly neck埇:**\n   Daria adds $10 to her piggy bank each week.\n\n3. **Total Cost of Vacuumadal:**\n   The vacuum cleaner costs $120.\n\n4. **Amount Needed:**\n   We need to find out how much more money Daria needs to reach $120. We subtract the initial amount from the total cost:\n   \\[\n   120 - 20 = 100\n   \\]\n   Daria needs $100 more.\n\n5. **Weeks Required:**\n   Since Daria adds $10 each week, we divide the amount needed by the weekly addition:\n   \\[\n   100 \\div 10 = 10\n   \\]\n   It will take Daria 10 weeks to add the remaining $100.\n\nTherefore, the number of weeks it will take Daria to raise enough money to cover the expense of the vacuum cleaner is \\boxed{10}.",
