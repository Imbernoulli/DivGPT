        "To find half the difference in the amount Margo and Julie donated, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the difference in the amounts donated by Margo and Julie.\n2. Calculate half of that difference.\n\nFirst, let's find the difference in the amounts donated by Margo and Julie. Margo donated $4300 and Julie donated $4700. So, we subtract the amount donated by Margo from the amount donated by Julie:\n\\[ 4700 - 4300 = 400 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find half of this difference. We do this by dividing the difference by 2:\n\\[ \\frac{400}{2} = 200 \\]\n\nTherefore, half the difference in the amount they contributed is \\(\\boxed{200}\\).",
