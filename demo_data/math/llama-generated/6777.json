        "To determine how much Gerald paid for his guitar, we need to understand that Hendricks bought it for $200, which is 20% less than what Gerald paid. This means that $200 is 80% of the price that Gerald paid. Let's denote the price that Gerald paid as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 200 = 0.8x \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.8:\n\\[ x = \\frac{200}{0.8} \\]\n\nPerforming the division, we get:\n\\[ x = 250 \\]\n\nTherefore, Gerald paid \\(\\boxed{250}\\) dollars for his guitar.",
