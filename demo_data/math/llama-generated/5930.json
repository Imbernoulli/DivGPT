        "To determine the percentage of the initial cost Matilda lost, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of money lost:**\n   Matilda bought the smartphone for $300 and sold it for $255. The amount of money lost is:\n   \\[\n   300 - 255 = 45\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the percentage loss relative to the initial cost:**\n   To find the percentage loss, we need to divide the amount of money lost by the initial cost and then multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage. The initial cost of the smartphone is $300. Therefore, the percentage loss is:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{45}{300} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   First, simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{45}{300}\\). Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor, which is 15:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{45 \\div 15}{300 \\div 15} = \\frac{3}{20}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert the fraction to a percentage:**\n   To convert \\(\\frac{3}{20}\\) to a percentage, multiply it by 100:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{3}{20} \\right) \\times 100 = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Matilda lost \\(\\boxed{15}\\) percent of the initial cost.",
