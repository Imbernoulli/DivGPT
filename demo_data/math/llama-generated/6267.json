Sum these costs to find the total cost of the meal before the tip.\n3. Calculate the tip, which is 20% of the total cost of the meal.\n4. Add the tip to the total cost of the meal to find the final amount spent.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The cost of the appetizer is $10, and the cost of each entree is $20. Since they ordered 4 entrees, the total cost of the entrees is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we add the cost of the appetizer to the total cost of the entrees to find the total cost of the meal before the tip:\n\\[ 10 + 80 = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the tip, which is 20% of the total cost of the meal. To find 20% of $90, we multiply $90 by 0.20:\n\\[ 90 \\times 0.20 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the tip to the total cost of the meal to find the final amount spent:\n\\[ 90 + 18 = 108 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money that Stefan's family spends at the restaurant is:\n\\[ \\boxed{108} \\]"
