        "To find the marks Jake scored in the third test, we start by using the information given about the average of the four tests.

Since the score in the fourth test is the same as the score in the third test, the score in the fourth test is also \\( x \\).

He scored 80 marks in the first test and 10 more in the second test, so his score in the second test is:\n\n\\[\n80 + 10 = 90\n\\]\n\nLet's denote the score in the third test by \\( x \\). Since the score in the fourth test is the same as the score in the third test, the score in the fourth test is also \\( x \\). Therefore, the total score for all four tests can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n80 + 90 + x + x = 170 + 2x\n\\]\n\nWe already know the total score is 300, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n170 + 2x = 300\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first subtract 170 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n2x = 300 - 170 = 130\n\\]\n\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{130}{2} = 65\n\\]\n\nThus, the marks Jake scored in the third test is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{65}\n\\]",
        "To find the marks Jake scored in the third test, we start by using the information given about the average of his marks in the four tests. The average of the marks scored in four tests is 75. This means that the total sum of the marks scored in the four tests is:\n\n\\[ 75 \\times 4 = 300 \\]\n\nNext, we know Jake's marks in the first and second tests. He scored 80 marks in the first test and 10 more in the second test, so his mark in the second test is:\n\n\\[ 80 + 10 = 90 \\]\n\nLet's denote the marks Jake scored in the third and fourth tests by \\( x \\). Since he scored an equal number of marks in the third and fourth tests, the total marks scored in the four tests can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ 80 + 90 + x + x = 300 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 170 + 2x = 300 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we first subtract 170 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x = 300 - 170 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 130 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{130}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 65 \\]\n\nTherefore, the marks Jake scored in the third test is \\(\\boxed{65}\\)."
