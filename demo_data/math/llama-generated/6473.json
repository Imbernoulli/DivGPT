        "First, we need to determine the total amount of money Jerome had initially. We know that half of Jerome's money was $43. Therefore, we can find the total amount of money by multiplying $43 by 2:\n\n\\[ 43 \\times 2 = 86 \\]\n\nSo, Jerome initially had $86.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much money Jerome gave to Meg and Bianca. Jerome gave $8 to Meg. To find out how much he gave to Bianca, we need to multiply the amount he gave to Meg by 3:\n\n\\[ 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\]\n\nSo, Jerome gave $24 to Bianca. Now, we add the amounts he gave to Meg and Bianca to find the total amount of money he gave away:\n\n\\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount of money he gave away from the initial amount of money he had:\n\n\\[ 86 - 32 = 54 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Jerome has left is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
