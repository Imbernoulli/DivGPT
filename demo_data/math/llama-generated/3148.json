        "To determine the total number of fish fillets Luke has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of fish Luke catches over the 30 days.\n2. Determine the total number of fillets based on the number of fish and the fact that each fish gives him 2 fillets.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of fish Luke catches. He catches 2 fish every day for 30 days. So, we multiply the number of fish per day by the number of days:\n\n\\[ 2 \\text{ fish/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 60 \\text{ fish} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many fillets Luke gets from these 60 fish.
