        "To determine how many more red marbles than yellow marbles are in the bowl, we start by identifying the number of blue and red marbles. We know that the total number of marbles is 19 and 5 of them are yellow. Therefore, the number of blue and red marbles combined is:\n\n\\[ 19 - 5 = 14 \\]\n\nThe blue and red marbles are in the ratio 3:4. This means that for every 7 marbles (3 blue + 4 red), the number of blue marbles is 3 and the number of red marbles is 4. To find out how many groups of 7 marbles are in the 14 marbles, we divide 14 by 7:\n\n\\[ 14 \\div 7 = 2 \\]\n\nThis means there are 2 groups of 7 marbles. Therefore, the number of blue marbles is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\]\n\nAnd the number of red marbles is:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more red marbles than yellow marbles there are. We subtract the number of yellow marbles from the number of red marbles:\n\n\\[ 8 - 5 = 3 \\]\n\nThus, there are \\(\\boxed{3}\\) more red marbles than yellow marbles.",
