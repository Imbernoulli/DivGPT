Adding these amounts together:\n\n\\[\n0.95 + 0.85 = 1.80\n\\]\n\nSo, Anna spent $1.80 on breakfast.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent on lunch.**\n\nAnna spent $4.65 on a sandwich and $1.15 on a carton of milk. Adding these amounts together:\n\n\\[\n4.65 + 1.15 = 5.80\n\\]\n\nSo, Anna spent $5.80 on lunch.\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the total amount spent on breakfast from the total amount spent on lunch.**\n\n\\[\n5.80 - 1.80 = 4.00\n\\]\n\nSo, Anna spent $4.00 more on lunch than on breakfast.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4.00}\n\\]",
