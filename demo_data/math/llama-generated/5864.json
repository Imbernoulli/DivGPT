        "To determine the total number of chairs in the hall, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the number of chairs for each group of tables separately.\n\nFirst, we find out how many tables have 2 chairs each. Since half of the 32 tables have 2 chairs each, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{32}{2} = 16\n\\]\nSo, there are 16 tables with 2 chairs each. The total number of chairs for these tables is:\n\\[\n16 \\times 2 = 32\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that 5 tables have 3 chairs each. The total number of chairs for these tables is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 3 = 15\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many tables have 4 chairs each. We know the total number of tables is 32, and we have already accounted for 16 tables with 2 chairs each and 5 tables with 3 chairs each. Therefore, the number of tables with 4 chairs each is:\n\\[\n32 - 16 - 5 = 11\n\\]\nSo, there are 11 tables with 4 chairs each. The total number of chairs for these tables is:\n\\[\n11 \\times 4 = 44\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add up the number of chairs from all the groups to get the total number of chairs in the hall:\n\\[\n32 + 15 + 44 = 91\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of chairs in the hall is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{91}\n\\]",

        "To determine the total number of chairs in the hall, we need to consider the number of tables and the number of chairs per table for each group of tables. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of tables with 2 chairs each:**\n   - There are 32 tables in total.\n   - Half of the tables have 2 chairs each.\n   - Number of tables with 2 chairs: \\( \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\)\n\n2. **Calculate the number of tables with 3 chairs each:**\n   - We are given that 5 tables have 3 chairs each.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of tables with 4 chairs each:**\n   - The rest of the tables have 4 chairs each.\n   - First, find the total number of tables with 2 and 3 chairs: \\( 16 + 5 = 21 \\).\n   - Subtract this from the total number of tables to find the number of tables with 4 chairs: \\( 32 - 21 = 11 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of chairs for each group:**\n   - tables with 2 chairs: \\( 16 \\times 2 = 32 \\)\n   - tables with 3 chairs: \\( 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\)\n   - tables with 4 chairs: \\( 11 \\times 4 = 44 \\)\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of chairs in the hall:**\n   - Add the number of chairs from all groups: \\( 32 + 15 + 44 = 91 \\)\n\nTherefore, the total number of chairs in the hall is \\(\\boxed{91}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of chairs in the hall, we need to calculate the number of chairs at each type of table and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of tables that have 2 chairs each:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of tables with 2 chairs} = \\frac{32}{2} = 16\n\\]\nThe total number of chairs at these tables is:\n\\[\n16 \\times 2 = 32\n\\]\n\nNext, we know there are 5 tables that have 3 chairs each. The total number of chairs at these tables is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 3 = 15\n\\]\n\nThe remaining tables have 4 chairs each. To find out how many tables this is, we subtract the number of tables with 2 chairs and the number of tables with 3 chairs from the total number of tables:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of tables with 4 chairs} = 32 - 16 - 5 = 11\n\\]\nThe total number of chairs at these tables is:\n\\[\n11 \\times 4 = 44\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the number of chairs from all the tables:\n\\[\n32 + 15 + 44 = 91\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of chairs in the hall is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{91}\n\\]"
