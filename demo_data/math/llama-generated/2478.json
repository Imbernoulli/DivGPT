        "To determine how many years it will take for Adam and Tom's combined age to be 44 years old, we start by defining the current ages and setting up an equation.\n\n1. **Current Ages:**\n   - Adam is 8 years old.\n   - Tom is 12 years old.\n\n2. **Combined Current Age:**\n   \\[\n   8 + 12 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Future Combined Age:**\n   We need their combined age to be 44 years old.\n\n4. ** Increase in Combined Age:**\n   \\[\n   44 - 20 = 24\n   \\]\n\n5. **Increase in Age per Year:**\n   Each year, both Adam and Tom age by 1 year. Therefore, the combined age increases by:\n   \\[\n   1 + 1 = 2 \\text{ years per year}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Number of Years Required:**\n   To find out how many years it will take for the combined age to increase by 24 years, we divide the total increase by the annual increase:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n   \\]\n\nThus, it will take \\(\\boxed{12}\\) years for Adam and Tom's combined age to be 44 years old.",
        "To determine how many years it will take for Adam and Tom's combined age to be 44 years old, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the current combined age of Adam and Tom.\n   Adam is 8 years old and Tom is 12 years old.\n   \\[\n   8 + 12 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, their current combined age is 20 years old.\n\n2.

Therefore, their combined age in \\( x \\) years will be:\n   \\[\n   (8 + x) + (12 + x) = 20 + 2x\n   \\]\n   We know that this combined age should be 44 years old, so we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   20 + 2x = 44\n   \\]\n\n3. Solve the equation for \\( x \\).\n   First, subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   2x = 24\n   \\]\n   Then, divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = 12\n   \\]\n\nSo, it will take \\(\\boxed{12}\\) years for Adam and Tom's combined age to be 44 years old.",

Adam is currently 8 years old, and Tom is currently 12 years old. Let's say that in \\( x \\) years, their combined age will be 44 years old.\n\nIn \\( x \\) years, Adam's age will be \\( 8 + x \\) and Tom's age will be \\( 12 + x \\). The sum of their ages in \\( x \\) years will be:\n\\[\n(8 + x) + (12 + x) = 20 + 2x\n\\]\nWe know that this sum should equal 44 years old, so we set up the equation:\n\\[\n20 + 2x = 44\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n2x = 24\n\\]\nNext, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx = 12\n\\]\nTherefore, in 12 years, Adam and Tom's combined age will be 44 years old.
