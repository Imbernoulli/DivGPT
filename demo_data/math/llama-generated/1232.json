        "Let's denote the amount of gold Katie has as \\( K \\). According to the problem, Greg has four times less gold than Katie, which means Greg has \\( \\frac{K}{4} \\) amount of gold. The total amount of gold is given as 100. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ K + \\frac{K}{4} = 100 \\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term in the equation by 4:\n\n\\[ 4K + K = 400 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ 5K = 400 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( K \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{400}{5} = 80 \\]\n\nSo, Katie has 80 units of gold. Since Greg has four times less gold than Katie, we calculate Greg's gold as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Greg's gold} = \\frac{K}{4} = \\frac{80}{4} = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of gold Greg has is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
