        "To determine how much money Paul had left after buying his groceries, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the juice.\n2. Add up the total cost of all the groceries.\n3. Subtract the total cost of the groceries from the amount of money Paul had.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the juice. The juice costs two times the price of the bread. Since the bread costs $2, the juice costs:\n\\[ 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we add up the total cost of all the groceries. The bread costs $2, the butter costs $3, and the juice costs $4. So, the total cost is:\n\\[ 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total cost of the groceries from the amount of money Paul had. Paul had $15, so the amount of money he has left is:\n\\[ 15 - 9 = 6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Paul has left is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
