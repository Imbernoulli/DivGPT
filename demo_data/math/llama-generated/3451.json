Subtract the number of donated puppies from the total number of puppies born.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of female dogs.**\n\nTenisha has 40 dogs, and 60% of them are female.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of female dogs} = 40 \\times 0.60 = 24\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many of the female dogs give birth.**\n\n3/4 of the female dogs give birth.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of female dogs that give birth} = 24 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 18\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of puppies born.**\n\nEach female dog that gives birth has 10 puppies.\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of puppies born} = 18 \\times 10 = 180\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the number of donated puppies from the total number of puppies born.**\n\nTenisha donates 130 puppies to the church.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of puppies remaining} = 180 - 130 = 50\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of puppies that Tenisha remains with after donating 130 puppies to the church is \\boxed{50}.",
