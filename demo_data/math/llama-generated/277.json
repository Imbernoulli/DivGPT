        "To determine how many sandwiches Bert has left after two days, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of sandwiches Bert ate on the first day.\n2. Calculate the number of sandwiches Bert ate on the second day.\n3. Subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number of sandwiches.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many sandwiches Bert ate on the first day. He ate half of the 12 sandwiches he made:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\nSo, Bert ate 6 sandwiches on the first day.\n\nNext, let's find out how many sandwiches Bert ate on the second day. He ate 2 sandwiches less than what he ate on the first day:\n\\[\n6 - 2 = 4\n\\]\nSo, Bert ate 4 sandwiches on the second day.\n\nNow, we add the number of sandwiches eaten on both days to find the total number of sandwiches eaten:\n\\[\n6 + 4 = 10\n\\]\nSo, Bert ate a total of 10 sandwiches over the two days.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number of sandwiches to find out how many sandwiches Bert has left:\n\\[\n12 - 10 = 2\n\\]\nTherefore, Bert has \\boxed{2} sandwiches left after these two days.",
