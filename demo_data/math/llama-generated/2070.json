She ate \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the remaining pizza for dinner, so we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Slices eaten for dinner} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2\n\\]\nSo, after dinner, the number of slices remaining is:\n\\[\n\\text{Slices remaining after dinner} = 6 - 2 = 4\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of slices left for Donna's lunch tomorrow is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
