        "To determine how many $10 bills Gail has in her wallet, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total value of the $5 bills:**\n   Gail has four $5 bills.\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 5 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the total value of the $5 bills is $20.\n\n2. **Calculate the total value of the $20 bills:**\n   Gail has three $20 bills.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 20 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, the total value of the $20 bills is $60.\n\n3. **Determine the total value of the $10 bills:**\n   Gail's total amount of money is $100. We subtract the total value of the $5 bills and the total value of the $20 bills from this amount to find the total value of the $10 bills.\n   \\[\n   100 - 20 - 60 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the total value of the $10 bills is $20.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of $10 bills:**\n   Each $10 bill is worth $10. To find the number of $10 bills, we divide the total value of the $10 bills by the value of one $10 bill.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{10} = 2\n   \\]\n   So, the number of $10 bills is 2.\n\nTherefore, the number of $10 bills in Gail's wallet is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

        "To determine the number of $10 bills Gail has in her wallet, we start by calculating the total value of the $5 bills and the $20 bills she possesses.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total value of the four $5 bills:\n\\[\n4 \\times 5 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total value of the three $20 bills:\n\\[\n3 \\times 20 = 60 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the values of the $5 bills and the $20 bills to find their combined total:\n\\[\n20 + 60 = 80 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nGail's total amount of money is $100. To find out how much money is in the $10 bills, we subtract the total value of the $5 and $20 bills from the total amount:\n\\[\n100 - 80 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nSince each $10 bill is worth $10, we divide the remaining amount by 10 to determine the number of $10 bills:\n\\[\n20 \\div 10 = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of $10 bills in Gail's wallet is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
        "To determine the number of $10 bills Gail has in her wallet, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total amount of money from the $5 bills:**\n   Gail has four $5 bills.\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 5 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount from the $5 bills is $20.\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of money from the $20 bills:**\n   Gail has three $20 bills.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 20 = 60\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount from the $20 bills is $60.\n\n3. **Add the amounts from the $5 bills and the $20 bills:**\n   \\[\n   20 + 60 = 80\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount from the $5 bills and the $20 bills combined is $80.\n\n4. **Determine the amount of money from the $10 bills:**\n   Gail has a total of $100 in her wallet. Subtract the total amount from the $5 and $20 bills from the total amount:\n   \\[\n   100 - 80 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the total amount from the $10 bills is $20.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of $10 bills:**\n   Each $10 bill is worth $10. Divide the total amount from the $10 bills by the value of one $10 bill:\n   \\[\n   20 \\div 10 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, the number of $10 bills is 2.\n\nTherefore, the number of $10 bills in Gail's wallet is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
