Use the total number of students to find the number of singers.\n\nGiven:\n- The total number of students at the party is 400.\n- The number of tree huggers is 120.\n- There are 50 more poets than tree huggers.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of poets. Since there are 50 more poets than tree huggers, we can express the number of poets as:\n\\[ \\text{Number of poets} = \\text{Number of tree huggers} + 50 \\]\nSubstituting the given number of tree huggers:\n\\[ \\text{Number of poets} = 120 + 50 = 170 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of singers. The total number of students is the sum of the number of poets, tree huggers, and singers. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of students} = \\text{Number of poets} + \\text{Number of tree huggers} + \\text{Number of singers} \\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[ 400 = 170 + 120 + \\text{Number of singers} \\]\nSimplifying the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 400 = 290 + \\text{Number of singers} \\]\nTo find the number of singers, we subtract 290 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ \\text{Number of singers} = 400 - 290 = 110 \\]\n\nThus, the number of singers at the party is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",
