        "To determine how many freshmen and sophomores do not own a pet, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of freshmen and sophomores:**\n   Given that 50 percent of the 400 students are freshmen or sophomores, we can find this number by multiplying 400 by 0.50:\n   \\[\n   0.50 \\times 400 = 200\n   \\]\n   So, there are 200 freshmen and sophomores.\n\n2. **Determine the number of freshmen and sophomores who own a pet:**\n   We know that 1/5 of the freshmen and sophomores own a pet. Therefore, we multiply the total number of freshmen and sophomores by 1/5:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} \\times 200 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, 40 freshmen and sophomores own a pet.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of freshmen and sophomores who do not own a pet:**\n   To find the number of freshmen and sophomores who do not own a pet, we subtract the number of freshmen and sophomores who own a pet from the total number of freshmen and sophomores:\n   \\[\n   200 - 40 = 160\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of freshmen and sophomores who do not own a pet is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",

Since 1/5 of the freshmen and sophomores own a pet, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times 200 = 40\n\\]\nSo, 40 freshmen and sophomores own a pet.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of freshmen and sophomores who own a pet from the total number of freshmen and sophomores to find out how many do not own a pet:\n\\[\n200 - 40 = 160\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of freshmen and sophomores who do not own a pet is \\boxed{160}.",
