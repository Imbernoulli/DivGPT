        "To determine the total number of students at the restaurant, we need to find out how many students ordered hot dogs and then add this number to the number of students who ordered burgers.\n\nLet's define the number of students who ordered hot dogs as \\( h \\). According to the problem, the number of students who ordered burgers is 30, which is twice the number of students who ordered hot dogs. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\n\\[ 30 = 2h \\]\n\nTo find \\( h \\), we need to solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\]\n\nSo, the number of students who ordered hot dogs is 15. Now, we can find the total number of students at the restaurant by adding the number of students who ordered burgers and the number of students who ordered hot dogs:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of students} = 30 + 15 = 45 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of students at the restaurant is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
