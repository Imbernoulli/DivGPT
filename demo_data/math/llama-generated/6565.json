        "To determine the number of pregnant female cows Terez has, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of female cows:**\n   Terez has 44 cows in total. Since 50 percent of the cows are female, we can find the number of female cows by multiplying the total number of cows by 50 percent (or 0.50):\n   \\[\n   44 \\times 0.50 = 22\n   \\]\n   So, Terez has 22 female cows.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of pregnant female cows:**\n   According to the problem, 50 percent of the female cows are pregnant. Therefore, we can find the number of pregnant female cows by multiplying the number of female cows by 50 percent (or 0.50):\n   \\[\n   22 \\times 0.50 = 11\n   \\]\n   So, Terez has 11 pregnant female cows.\n\nThus, the number of pregnant female cows Terez has is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
