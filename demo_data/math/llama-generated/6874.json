        "To determine the total number of paint cans Bill will need, we start by calculating the number of rooms in the house. The house has three bedrooms and twice as many other rooms as bedrooms. Therefore, the number of other rooms is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\]\n\nAdding the bedrooms and other rooms gives us the total number of rooms in the house:\n\n\\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of paint needed for the bedrooms. Since each bedroom is painted a different color and each room takes 2 gallons of paint, the total amount of color paint needed is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nSince color paint comes in 1-gallon cans, the number of cans of color paint required is:\n\n\\[ 6 \\text{ cans} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the amount of white paint needed. Since each of the other 6 rooms is painted white and each room takes 2 gallons of paint, the total amount of white paint needed is:\n\n\\[ 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nSince white paint comes in 3-gallon cans, the number of cans of white paint required is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\text{ cans} \\]\n\nAdding the cans of color paint and white paint gives us the total number of paint cans Bill will need:\n\n\\[ 6 + 4 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of paint cans Bill will need for the whole house is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",

Since there are 6 other rooms:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 2 = 12\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Bill needs 12 gallons of white paint.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of cans of color paint needed:**\n   Color paint comes in 1-gallon paint cans. Since Bill needs 6 gallons:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{1} = 6\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Bill needs 6 cans of color paint.\n\n6. **Calculate the number of cans of white paint needed:**\n   White paint comes in 3-gallon paint cans. Since Bill needs 12 gallons:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Bill needs 4 cans of white paint.\n\n7. **Calculate the total number of paint cans needed:**\n   Add the number of color paint cans and the number of white paint cans:\n   \\[\n   6 + 4 = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Bill will need \\boxed{10} cans of paint for the whole house.",
