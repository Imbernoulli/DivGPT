        "To determine the total number of copies of the book sold by Friday, we need to calculate the number of copies sold each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many copies were sold on Thursday. According to the problem, the book sold three times as many copies on Thursday as it did on Wednesday. Since the book sold 15 copies on Wednesday, we calculate the number of copies sold on Thursday as follows:\n\\[ 15 \\times 3 = 45 \\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many copies were sold on Friday. The book sold one-fifth the number of copies on Friday as it did on Thursday. Since the book sold 45 copies on Thursday, we calculate the number of copies sold on Friday as follows:\n\\[ 45 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = 9 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of copies sold on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday to find the total number of copies sold by Friday:\n\\[ 15 + 45 + 9 = 69 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of copies of the book sold by Friday is \\(\\boxed{69}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of copies of the book sold by Friday, we need to calculate the number of copies sold each day and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we know that on Wednesday the book sold 15 copies.

Therefore, the number of copies sold on Thursday is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 15 = 45 \\]\n\nOn Friday, the book sold one-fifth the number of copies it sold on Thursday. Therefore, the number of copies sold on Friday is:\n\\[ \\frac{45}{5} = 9 \\]\n\nTo find the total number of copies sold by Friday, we add the number of copies sold on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday:\n\\[ 15 + 45 + 9 = 69 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of copies of the book sold by Friday is:\n\\[ \\boxed{69} \\]",
