His train pulls 3 red boxcars, 4 blue boxcars, and 7 black boxcars.  If the black boxcars can each hold 4000 pounds of coal, which is half as much as what the blue boxcars can hold, and the red boxcars can hold 3 times as much as the blue boxcars, how many pounds of coal can all of the train's boxcars combined hold?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total capacity of all the train's boxcars combined, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of boxcar and then sum these capacities.\n\nFirst, we find the capacity of the blue boxcars. We know that each black boxcar can hold 4000 pounds of coal, and this is half as much as what a blue boxcar can hold. Therefore, the capacity of each blue boxcar is:\n\\[ 4000 \\times 2 = 8000 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nNext, we find the capacity of the red boxcars. We know that each red boxcar can hold 3 times as much as a blue boxcar.
