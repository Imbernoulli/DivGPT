        "To determine the total number of pages Jairus and Arniel have read, we start by identifying how many pages each person read.\n\nFirst, we know that Jairus read 20 pages of the newspaper. This can be written as:\n\\[ \\text{Pages read by Jairus} = 20 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pages Arniel read. The problem states that Arniel read 2 more than twice the number of pages Jairus read. We can express this mathematically as:\n\\[ \\text{Pages read by Arniel} = 2 \\times \\text{Pages read by Jairus} + 2 \\]\nSubstituting the number of pages Jairus read into the equation, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Pages read by Arniel} = 2 \\times 20 + 2 = 40 + 2 = 42 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of pages read by Jairus and Arniel to find the total number of pages they have read altogether:\n\\[ \\text{Total pages read} = \\text{Pages read by Jairus} + \\text{Pages read by Arniel} = 20 + 42 = 62 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages they have read altogether is:\n\\[ \\boxed{62} \\]",
