        "To determine how many sales were in the stationery section, we need to first calculate the number of sales in the fabric and jewelry sections, and then subtract these from the total number of sales.\n\n1. Calculate the number of sales in the fabric section:\n   The craft store makes a third of its sales in the fabric section. Since the total number of sales today is 36, we can find the number of sales in the fabric section by multiplying 36 by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\):\n   \\[\n   36 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 12\n   \\]\n   So, there were 12 sales in the fabric section.\n\n2. Calculate the number of sales in the jewelry section:\n   The craft store makes a quarter of its sales in the jewelry section. Since the total number of sales today is 36, we can find the number of sales in the jewelry section by multiplying 36 by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\):\n   \\[\n   36 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   So, there were 9 sales in the jewelry section.\n\n3. Calculate the number of sales in the stationery section:\n   The rest of the sales were in the stationery section. To find this, we subtract the number of sales in the fabric and jewelry sections from the total number of sales:\n   \\[\n   36 - 12 - 9 = 15\n   \\]\n   So, there were 15 sales in the stationery section.\n\nTherefore, the number of sales in the stationery section is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",

The total number of sales today is 36.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of sales in the fabric section:\n\\[\n\\text{Sales in fabric section} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 36 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of sales in the jewelry section:\n\\[\n\\text{Sales in jewelry section} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 36 = 9\n\\]\n\nThe rest of the sales are in the stationery section. To find the number of sales in the stationery section, we subtract the sales in the fabric and jewelry sections from the total number of sales:\n\\[\n\\text{Sales in stationery section} = 36 - (\\text{Sales in fabric section} + \\text{Sales in jewelry section}) = 36 - (12 + 9) = 36 - 21 = 15\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of sales in the stationery section is \\boxed{15}.",
        "To determine the number of sales in the stationery section, we start by calculating the sales in the fabric and jewelry sections.\n\nFirst, we find the number of sales in the fabric section. The craft store makes a third of its sales in the fabric section:\n\\[\n\\text{Sales in fabric section} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 36 = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the number of sales in the jewelry section. The craft store makes a quarter of its sales in the jewelry section:\n\\[\n\\text{Sales in jewelry section} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 36 = 9\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the sales from the fabric and jewelry sections to find out how many sales were made in these two sections combined:\n\\[\n\\text{Sales in fabric and jewelry sections} = 12 + 9 = 21\n\\]\n\nSince the total number of sales is 36, the number of sales in the stationery section is the total number of sales minus the number of sales in the fabric and jewelry sections:\n\\[\n\\text{Sales in stationery section} = 36 - 21 = 15\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of sales in the stationery section is \\boxed{15}.",
