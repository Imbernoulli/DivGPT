        "To determine how many hours Jason spends cutting grass over the weekend, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of lawns Jason cuts over the weekend.\n2. Determine the total time Jason spends cutting these lawns.\n3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lawns Jason cuts over the weekend.**\n\nJason cuts 8 lawns on Saturday and 8 lawns on Sunday. Therefore, the total number of lawns he cuts is:\n\\[ 8 + 8 = 16 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total time Jason spends cutting these lawns.**\n\nIt takes Jason 30 minutes to cut one lawn. So, the total time to cut 16 lawns is:\n\\[ 16 \\times 30 = 480 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.**\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour. To convert 480 minutes to hours, we divide by 60:\n\\[ 480 \\div 60 = 8 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of hours Jason spends cutting grass over the weekend is:\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",
