        "To determine the number of foreign students at the university after the addition of 200 new foreign students, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of foreign students currently at the university.\n2. Add the number of new foreign students to the current number of foreign students.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of foreign students currently at the university. We know that 30% of the 1800 students are from other countries. So, we multiply 1800 by 30% (or 0.30):\n\n\\[\n1800 \\times 0.30 = 540\n\\]\n\nThis means there are currently 540 foreign students at the university.\n\nNext, we add the 200 new foreign students to the current number of foreign students:\n\n\\[\n540 + 200 = 740\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of foreign students at the university after the addition of the new students will be \\boxed{740}.",

Add the number of new foreign students to the current number of foreign students.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the current number of foreign students. The problem states that 30% of all the students are from other countries. The total number of students at the university is 1800. Therefore, we can find the current number of foreign students by multiplying 1800 by 30%.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current number of foreign students} = 1800 \\times 0.30 = 540\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the 200 new foreign students to the current number of foreign students.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of foreign students after the addition} = 540 + 200 = 740\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of foreign students who will then study at the university is \\boxed{740}.",
        "To determine the number of foreign students at the university after the addition of new students, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of foreign students currently at the university.\n2. Add the number of new foreign students to the current number of foreign students.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of foreign students currently at the university. We know that 30% of the 1800 students are from other countries. Therefore, we can find the number of foreign students by multiplying 1800 by 0.30:\n\n\\[ 1800 \\times 0.30 = 540 \\]\n\nSo, there are currently 540 foreign students at the university.\n\nNext, we add the 200 new foreign students to the current number of foreign students:\n\n\\[ 540 + 200 = 740 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of foreign students at the university after the addition of new students will be \\(\\boxed{740}\\).",
