        "To determine the height of the tree when Kevin planted it, we start by letting \\( h \\) represent the height of the tree at that time. According to the problem, the current height of the tree is 180 inches, which is 50% taller than its height when it was planted. This means that the current height is equal to the original height plus 50% of the original height. We can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\n\\[ 180 = h + 0.5h \\]\n\nCombining like terms on the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 180 = 1.5h \\]\n\nTo find \\( h \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{180}{1.5} \\]\n\nPerforming the division, we get:\n\n\\[ h = 120 \\]\n\nSo, the height of the tree when Kevin planted it was 120 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 120 inches to feet by dividing by 12:\n\n\\[ 120 \\div 12 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the tree when Kevin planted it was \\(\\boxed{10}\\) feet.",

        "To determine the height of the tree when Kevin planted it, we start by noting that the current height of the tree is 180 inches, which is 50% taller than its height when it was planted. This means that the current height is 150% of the height when it was planted. We can represent this relationship mathematically as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current height} = \\text{Height when planted} + 0.5 \\times \\text{Height when planted} = 1.5 \\times \\text{Height when planted} \\]\n\nGiven that the current height is 180 inches, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n\\[ 180 = 1.5 \\times \\text{Height when planted} \\]\n\nTo find the height when the tree was planted, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:\n\n\\[ \\text{Height when planted} = \\frac{180}{1.5} = 120 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide 120 inches by 12:\n\n\\[ \\text{Height when planted in feet} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nThus, the height of the tree when Kevin planted it was \\(\\boxed{10}\\) feet.",
        "To determine the original height of the tree when Kevin planted it, we start by letting \\( h \\) be the height of the tree at the time it was planted. According to the problem, the current height of the tree is 180 inches, which is 50% taller than its original height. This means that the current height is equal to the original height plus 50% of the original height.\n\nWe can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\\[ 180 = h + 0.5h \\]\n\nCombining the terms on the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 180 = 1.5h \\]\n\nTo find the original height \\( h \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:\n\\[ h = \\frac{180}{1.5} \\]\n\nPerforming the division, we get:\n\\[ h = 120 \\]\n\nSo, the original height of the tree was 120 inches. To convert this height into feet, we use the fact that there are 12 inches in a foot:\n\\[ 120 \\text{ inches} = \\frac{120}{12} \\text{ feet} = 10 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, the original height of the tree was \\(\\boxed{10}\\) feet.",
