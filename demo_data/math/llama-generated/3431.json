So, we calculate the discount amount as follows:\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } \\$20.00 = 0.20 \\times 20 = \\$4.00 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price of each backpack:\n\\[ \\$20.00 - \\$4.00 = \\$16.00 \\]\n\nNow, we add the cost of monogramming to the discounted price. The cost of monogramming each backpack is $12.00. So, the total cost for each backpack is:\n\\[ \\$16.00 + \\$12.00 = \\$28.00 \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost for all 5 backpacks by multiplying the cost of each backpack by 5:\n\\[ 5 \\times \\$28.00 = \\$140.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the backpacks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{140} \\]",

Multiply the total cost per backpack by the number of backpacks.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discount on each backpack.**\n\nThe original price of each backpack is $20.00, and there is a 20% discount.\n\\[ \\text{Discount} = 20\\% \\times 20 = 0.20 \\times 20 = 4 \\]\nSo, the discount on each backpack is $4.00.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost of each backpack after the discount.**\n\nSubtract the discount from the original price.\n\\[ \\text{Discounted price} = 20 - 4 = 16 \\]\nSo, the cost of each backpack after the discount is $16.00.\n\n**Step 3: Add the cost of monogramming to the discounted price of each backpack.**\n\nThe cost of monogramming each backpack is $12.00.\n\\[ \\text{Total cost per backpack} = 16 + 12 = 28 \\]\nSo, the total cost of each personalized backpack is $28.00.\n\n**Step 4: Multiply the total cost per backpack by the number of backpacks.**\n\nGrandma wants to order 5 personalized backpacks.\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 28 \\times 5 = 140 \\]\nSo, the total cost for all the backpacks is $140.00.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the backpacks is \\(\\boxed{140}\\).",
        "To determine the total cost of the personalized backpacks, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the discount on each backpack.\n2. Determine the cost of monogramming each backpack.\n3. Find the total cost for all 5 backpacks.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discount on each backpack.**\n\nThe original price of each backpack is $20.00, and there is a 20% discount. First, we calculate the amount of the discount:\n\n\\[ \\text{Discount} = 20\\% \\text{ of } 20.00 = 0.20 \\times 20.00 = 4.00 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price:\n\n\\[ \\text{Discounted Price} = 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost of monogramming each backpack.**\n\nThe cost of monogramming each backpack is $12.00.\n\n**Step 3: Find the total cost for all 5 backpacks.**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the discounted backpacks:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost of Backpacks} = 5 \\times 16.00 = 80.00 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of monogramming all 5 backpacks:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost of Monogramming} = 5 \\times 12.00 = 60.00 \\]\n\nFinally, we add the total cost of the backpacks and the total cost of monogramming to find the overall total cost:\n\n\\[ \\text{Overall Total Cost} = 80.00 + 60.00 = 140.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the backpacks is \\(\\boxed{140.00}\\)."
