        "To determine the total number of golf balls purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris, we need to convert the dozens they buy into individual golf balls and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many golf balls Dan buys:\n- Dan buys 5 dozen.\n- Since 1 dozen equals 12 golf balls, Dan buys \\(5 \\times 12 = 60\\) golf balls.\n\nNext, let's find out how many golf balls Gus buys:\n- Gus buys 2 dozen.\n- Since 1 dozen equals 12 golf balls, Gus buys \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) golf balls.\n\nThen, let's find out how many golf balls Chris buys:\n- Chris buys 48 golf balls.\n\nNow, we add up the golf balls purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris:\n\\[60 + 24 + 48 = 132\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of golf balls they purchase is \\(\\boxed{132}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of golf balls purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris, we start by calculating the number of golf balls each person buys individually.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much it costs to buy one dozen golf balls. The batting cage charges $30 for 3 dozen, so the cost per dozen is:\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{3} = 10 \\text{ dollars per dozen}\n\\]\n\nHowever, we don't need the cost to find the total number of golf balls purchased.

Therefore, the number of golf balls Dan buys is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 12 = 60 \\text{ golf balls}\n\\]\n\nGus buys 2 dozen golf balls. Therefore, the number of golf balls Gus buys is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 12 = 24 \\text{ golf balls}\n\\]\n\nChris buys 48 golf balls. Since Chris already has the number of golf balls in individual units, we don't need to convert dozens to golf balls for Chris.\n\nNow, we add up the number of golf balls purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris:\n\\[\n60 + 24 + 48 = 132\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of golf balls they purchase is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{132}\n\\]",

Since 1 dozen equals 12 golf balls, we multiply:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\nSo, Gus buys 24 golf balls.\n\nThen, let's calculate the number of golf balls Chris buys:\nChris buys 48 golf balls. Since the problem states that Chris buys 48 golf balls directly, we don't need to convert dozens to golf balls for Chris.\n\nNow, we sum the total number of golf balls purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris:\n\\[ 60 + 24 + 48 = 132 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of golf balls they purchase is \\(\\boxed{132}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of golf balls purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris, we start by calculating the number of golf balls each person buys.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many golf balls Dan buys:\nDan buys 5 dozen golf balls. Since each dozen is 12 golf balls, we multiply:\n\\[ 5 \\times 12 = 60 \\]\nSo, Dan buys 60 golf balls.\n\nNext, we calculate how many golf balls Gus buys:\nGus buys 2 dozen golf balls. Similarly, we multiply:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\nSo, Gus buys 24 golf balls.\n\nThen, we calculate how many golf balls Chris buys:\nChris buys 48 golf balls. Since we are given the number of golf balls directly, we don't need to perform any multiplication here.\n\nNow, we sum the number of golf balls purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris:\n\\[ 60 + 24 + 48 = 132 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of golf balls they purchase is:\n\\[ \\boxed{132} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of golf balls purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of golf balls Dan buys.\n2.

Again, since 1 dozen equals 12 golf balls, we multiply:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\nSo, Gus buys 24 golf balls.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the number of golf balls Chris buys:\nChris buys 48 golf balls. Since 48 is already given in individual golf balls, we do not need to convert it.\n\nNow, we add up the total number of golf balls purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris:\n\\[ 60 + 24 + 48 = 132 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of golf balls they purchase is \\(\\boxed{132}\\).",
        "First, let's determine the cost per dozen golf balls. The batting cage charges $30 for 3 dozen golf balls. Therefore, the cost per dozen is:\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{3} = 10 \\text{ dollars per dozen}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the problem only asks for the total number of golf balls purchased, so the cost is not needed for our calculations. Let's find out how many golf balls each person buys.\n\nDan buys 5 dozen golf balls. Since each dozen is 12 golf balls, the total number of golf balls Dan buys is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 12 = 60\n\\]\n\nGus buys 2 dozen golf balls. Therefore, the total number of golf balls Gus buys is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 12 = 24\n\\]\n\nChris buys 48 golf balls. Since 48 is already given in terms of individual golf balls, Chris buys:\n\\[\n48\n\\]\n\nNow, we add up the total number of golf balls purchased by Dan, Gus, and Chris:\n\\[\n60 + 24 + 48 = 132\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of golf balls they purchase is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{132}\n\\]",
