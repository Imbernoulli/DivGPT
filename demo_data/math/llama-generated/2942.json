        "To determine how many cookies John has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cookies John initially buys.\n2. Subtract the number of cookies John eats from the total number of cookies.\n\nFirst, we know that John buys 2 dozen cookies. Since one dozen equals 12 cookies, we can calculate the total number of cookies as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, we know that John eats 3 cookies. To find out how many cookies he has left, we subtract the number of cookies he eats from the total number of cookies:\n\\[ 24 - 3 = 21 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies John has left is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",

John eats 3 cookies, so we subtract 3 from 24:\n\\[ 24 - 3 = 21 \\]\nSo, John has 21 cookies left.\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies John has left is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
        "To determine how many cookies John has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cookies John buys:**\n   John buys 2 dozen cookies.

Since one dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of cookies as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, we know that John eats 3 cookies. To find out how many cookies he has left, we subtract the number of cookies he eats from the total number of cookies:\n\\[ 24 - 3 = 21 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies John has left is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).",
        "To determine how many cookies John has left after eating some, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cookies John buys:**\n   John buys 2 dozen cookies. Since there are 12 cookies in a dozen, we multiply the number of dozens by the number of cookies per dozen:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 12 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, John buys 24 cookies.\n\n2. **Determine how many cookies John eats:**\n   John eats 3 cookies.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of cookies John has left:**\n   To find out how many cookies John has left, we subtract the number of cookies he eats from the total number of cookies he buys:\n   \\[\n   24 - 3 = 21\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies John has left is \\boxed{21}.",
