        "To determine the total time Marla spends on this errand, we need to add up the time spent driving to the school, attending the parent-teacher night, and driving back home. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Driving to the school:**\n   Marla spends 20 minutes driving one way to her son's school.\n\n2. **Attending parent-teacher night:**\n   Marla spends 70 minutes attending parent-teacher night.\n\n3. **Driving home:**\n   Marla spends the same amount of time driving home as she did driving to the school, which is 20 minutes.\n\nNow, we add these times together:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ minutes (driving to school)} + 70 \\text{ minutes (attending parent-teacher night)} + 20 \\text{ minutes (driving home)}\n\\]\n\nFirst, add the driving times:\n\\[\n20 + 20 = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, add the time spent at the parent-teacher night:\n\\[\n40 + 70 = 110 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Marla spends on this errand is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{110}\n\\]",
