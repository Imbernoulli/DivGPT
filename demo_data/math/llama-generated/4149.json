Convert the total height back to feet and inches, if necessary.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the height of Marissa's little sister to inches.**\n\nMarissa's little sister is 4 feet 3 inches tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the feet to inches and then add the additional inches:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ feet} \\times 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 48 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n48 \\text{ inches} + 3 \\text{ inches} = 51 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nSo, Marissa's little sister is 51 inches tall.\n\n**Step 2: Add the height difference to the height of Marissa's little sister.**\n\nMarissa's sunflower is 21 inches taller than her little sister. Therefore, we add 21 inches to 51 inches:\n\n\\[\n51 \\text{ inches} + 21 \\text{ inches} = 72 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert the total height back to feet and inches.**\n\nSince there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide 72 inches by 12 to find the number of feet:\n\n\\[\n72 \\text{ inches} \\div 12 \\text{ inches/foot} = 6 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nSo, Marissa's sunflower is 6 feet tall.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
