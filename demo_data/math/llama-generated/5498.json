        "Let's denote Michael's current age by \\( M \\).\n\nFirst, we need to determine the age of Michael's oldest brother. According to the problem, the oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. When Michael was a year younger, his age was \\( M - 1 \\). Therefore, twice Michael's age at that time is \\( 2(M - 1) \\). Adding 1 year to this age gives us the oldest brother's age:\n\\[\n2(M - 1) + 1 = 2M - 2 + 1 = 2M - 1\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Michael's younger brother is 5 years old, and this age is a third of the age of the oldest brother. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n5 = \\frac{1}{3}(2M - 1)\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( M \\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[\n5 \\times 3 = 2M - 1 \\implies 15 = 2M - 1\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( M \\) by adding 1 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n15 + 1 = 2M \\implies 16 = 2M\n\\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( M \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[\nM = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, Michael is 8 years old. Now, we can find the age of his oldest brother:\n\\[\n2M - 1 = 2(8) - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15\n\\]\n\nWe already know that Michael's younger brother is 5 years old. Therefore, the combined age of Michael and his two brothers is:\n\\[\n8 + 15 + 5 = 28\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{28}\n\\]",

Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n5 = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{Age of the oldest brother}\n\\]\nSubstituting the expression for the age of the oldest brother, we get:\n\\[\n5 = \\frac{1}{3}(2M - 1)\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( M \\), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[\n5 \\times 3 = 2M - 1 \\implies 15 = 2M - 1\n\\]\nNext, we add 1 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n15 + 1 = 2M \\implies 16 = 2M\n\\]\nThen, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nM = \\frac{16}{2} \\implies M = 8\n\\]\nSo, Michael is 8 years old. Now, we can find the age of his oldest brother:\n\\[\n\\text{Age of the oldest brother} = 2M - 1 = 2(8) - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15\n\\]\nWe already know that Michael's younger brother is 5 years old.

First, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 2m - 1 \\]\n\\[ 15 = 2m - 1 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( m \\) by adding 1 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 15 + 1 = 2m \\]\n\\[ 16 = 2m \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( m \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ m = \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\]\n\nSo, Michael is 8 years old.

Therefore, we can express the age of Michael's oldest brother as:\n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\]\nSo, Michael's oldest brother is 15 years old.\n\nNext, we need to find Michael's current age. The problem states that Michael's oldest brother is 1 year older than twice Michael's age when Michael was a year younger. When Michael was a year younger, his age was \\( x - 1 \\). Therefore, twice Michael's age when he was a year younger is:\n\\[ 2(x - 1) = 2x - 2 \\]\nSince Michael's oldest brother is 1 year older than this age, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ 15 = 2x - 2 + 1 \\]\nSimplify the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 15 = 2x - 1 \\]\nAdd 1 to both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n\\[ 16 = 2x \\]\nDivide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 8 \\]\nSo, Michael is 8 years old.\n\nNow, we know the ages of all three brothers: Michael is 8 years old, his older brother is 15 years old, and his younger brother is 5 years old. To find their combined age, we add these ages together:\n\\[ 8 + 15 + 5 = 28 \\]\n\nTherefore, their combined age is:\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]"
