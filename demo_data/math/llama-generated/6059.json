        "To determine how many extra square feet the leftover grass seed could cover after Drew reseeds his lawn, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total area of Drew's lawn.\n2. Determine the total coverage of the four bags of grass seed.\n3. Subtract the area of the lawn from the total coverage to find the extra square feet.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of Drew's lawn. The lawn is a rectangle with a length of 22 feet and a width of 36 feet. The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n\\]\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[\nA = 22 \\times 36 = 792 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's determine the total coverage of the four bags of grass seed. Each bag covers 250 square feet, so the total coverage \\( C \\) for four bags is:\n\\[\nC = 4 \\times 250 = 1000 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nNow, we subtract the area of the lawn from the total coverage to find the extra square feet:\n\\[\n\\text{Extra square feet} = C - A = 1000 - 792 = 208 \\text{ square feet}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the leftover grass seed could cover \\(\\boxed{208}\\) extra square feet after Drew reseeds his lawn.",
