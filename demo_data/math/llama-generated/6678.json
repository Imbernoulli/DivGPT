        "To determine how much more money Dave has left than Derek, we need to calculate the amount of money each of them has left after their respective expenses.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much money Derek has left:\n1. Derek starts with $40.\n2. He spends $14 on lunch for himself.\n3. He spends $11 on lunch for his dad.\n4. He spends an additional $5 on more lunch for himself.\n\nWe add up all of Derek's expenses:\n\\[\n14 + 11 + 5 = 30\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total expenses from Derek's initial amount:\n\\[\n40 - 30 = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, Derek has $10 left.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Dave has left:\n1. Dave starts with $50.\n2. He spends $7 on lunch for his mom.\n\nWe subtract Dave's expense from his initial amount:\n\\[\n50 - 7 = 43\n\\]\n\nSo, Dave has $43 left.\n\nFinally, we determine how much more money Dave has left than Derek by subtracting Derek's remaining amount from Dave's remaining amount:\n\\[\n43 - 10 = 33\n\\]\n\nThus, Dave has \\(\\boxed{33}\\) more dollars left than Derek.",
