        "To determine Christian's age in eight years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find Brian's current age:**\n   - We know that in eight years, Brian will be 40 years old.\n   - Therefore, Brian's current age is:\n     \\[\n     40 - 8 = 32\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find Christian's current age:**\n   - Christian is twice as old as Brian.\n   - Therefore, Christian's current age is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 32 = 64\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find Christian's age in eight years:**\n   - To find out how old Christian will be in eight years, we add 8 to his current age:\n     \\[\n     64 + 8 = 72\n     \\]\n\nThus, Christian will be \\boxed{72} years old in eight years.",

Therefore, Brian's current age is:\n\\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Christian is twice as old as Brian. So, Christian's current age is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 32 = 64 \\]\n\nFinally, to find out how old Christian will be in eight years, we add eight to his current age:\n\\[ 64 + 8 = 72 \\]\n\nThus, Christian will be \\(\\boxed{72}\\) years old in eight years.",
