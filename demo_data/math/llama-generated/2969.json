On flat sand, it can ride at a speed of 60 miles per hour.  When traveling on downhill slopes, it can race at 12 miles per hour faster than it can when it is on flat sand.  And when riding on an uphill inclined slow, it travels at a speed 18 miles per hour slower than when it is riding on flat sand.  If Conner rides his dune buggy one-third of the time on flat sand, one-third of the time on uphill slopes, and one-third of the time on downhill slopes, what is his average speed in miles per hour?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the speeds on each type of terrain:**\n   - On flat sand: \\(60\\) miles per hour.\n   - On downhill slopes: \\(60 + 12 = 72\\) miles per hour.\n   - On uphill slopes: \\(60 - 18 = 42\\) miles per hour.\n\n2. **Calculate the average speed:**\n   Since Conner spends one-third of the time on each type of terrain, we can find the average speed by taking the weighted average of the speeds. The formula for the average speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average speed} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{speed on flat sand}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{speed on downhill slopes}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{speed on uphill slopes}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average speed} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 60\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 72\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 42\\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying each term:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average speed} = 20 + 24 + 14\n   \\]\n   Adding these together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average speed} = 58\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Conner's average speed is \\(\\boxed{58}\\) miles per hour.",
        "To determine Conner's average speed, we need to calculate the speed of the dune buggy on each type of terrain and then find the weighted average of these speeds based on the time spent on each type of terrain.\n\n1. **Speed on flat sand:**\n   The dune buggy travels at 60 miles per hour on flat sand.\n\n2. **Speed on downhill slopes:**\n   The dune buggy travels 12 miles per hour faster on downhill slopes than on flat sand.\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ miles per hour} + 12 \\text{ miles per hour} = 72 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Speed on uphill slopes:**\n   The dune buggy travels 18 miles per hour slower on uphill slopes than on flat sand.\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ miles per hour} - 18 \\text{ miles per hour} = 42 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Time spent on each type of terrain:**\n   Conner spends one-third of the time on flat sand, one-third of the time on uphill slopes, and one-third of the time on downhill slopes.\n\n5. **Calculate the average speed:**\n   The average speed is the weighted average of the speeds on each type of terrain. Since the time spent on each type is equal, we can simply add the speeds and divide by 3.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles per hour} + 72 \\text{ miles per hour} + 42 \\text{ miles per hour}}{3}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Perform the addition:**\n   \\[\n   60 + 72 + 42 = 174\n   \\]\n\n7. **Divide by 3:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{174}{3} = 58\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Conner's average speed is \\(\\boxed{58}\\) miles per hour."
