To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total amount of ice by the amount of ice per pack:\n\\[ \\frac{30 \\text{ pounds}}{10 \\text{ pounds/pack}} = 3 \\text{ packs} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the ice.**\n\nEach pack costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost for 3 packs is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ packs} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/pack} = 9 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the total amount Chad will spend on ice is:\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]",
