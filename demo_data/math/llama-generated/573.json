        "To determine how many goldfish are below the surface, we first need to find out how many goldfish are at the surface and then use that information to find the total number of goldfish in the pond. Finally, we will subtract the number of goldfish at the surface from the total number to find the number below the surface.\n\n1. Toby counts 15 goldfish at the surface. Since these goldfish represent 25% of the total number of goldfish, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of goldfish (\\(x\\)):\n   \\[\n   0.25x = 15\n   \\]\n2. To solve for \\(x\\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{15}{0.25} = 60\n   \\]\n   So, the total number of goldfish in the pond is 60.\n3. Since 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, the remaining 75% are below the surface. To find the number of goldfish below the surface, we calculate 75% of the total number of goldfish:\n   \\[\n   0.75 \\times 60 = 45\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of goldfish below the surface is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).",
