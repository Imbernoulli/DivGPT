        "To determine how tall Manny's tree will be in 4 months, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the current height to centimeters:**\n   The tree is currently 2 meters tall. Since 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, we convert meters to centimeters:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ meters} = 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\text{ centimeters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of weeks in 4 months:**\n   We know there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. Therefore, in 4 months there are:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ months} \\times 4 \\text{ weeks/month} = 16 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total growth over 16 weeks:**\n   The tree grows 50 centimeters every 2 weeks. To find out how many 2-week periods are in 16 weeks, we divide 16 by 2:\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ weeks} \\div 2 \\text{ weeks/period} = 8 \\text{ periods}\n   \\]\n   Since the tree grows 50 centimeters in each 2-week period, the total growth over 8 periods is:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ periods} \\times 50 \\text{ centimeters/period} = 400 \\text{ centimeters}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Add the total growth to the initial height:**\n   The initial height of the tree is 200 centimeters. Adding the total growth of 400 centimeters gives:\n   \\[\n   200 \\text{ centimeters} + 400 \\text{ centimeters} = 600 \\text{ centimeters}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the tree in 4 months will be \\(\\boxed{600}\\) centimeters.",
