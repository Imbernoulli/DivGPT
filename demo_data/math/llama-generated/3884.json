        "To determine Faith's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings from her regular hours and her overtime hours separately, and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate her earnings from her regular hours:\n- Faith works 8 hours a day.\n- She works 5 days a week.\n- Therefore, her total regular hours for the week is \\(8 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 40 \\text{ hours/week}\\).\n- Her hourly wage is $13.50.\n- So, her earnings from regular hours are \\(40 \\text{ hours/week} \\times \\$13.50/\\text{hour} = \\$540\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate her earnings from her overtime hours:\n- Faith works 2 hours of overtime per day.\n- She works 5 days a week.\n- Therefore, her total overtime hours for the week is \\(2 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days/week} = 10 \\text{ hours/week}\\).\n- Her hourly wage for overtime is $13.50 (assuming overtime pay is the same as regular pay).\n- So, her earnings from overtime hours are \\(10 \\text{ hours/week} \\times \\$13.50/\\text{hour} = \\$135\\).\n\nFinally, we sum her earnings from regular hours and overtime hours to get her total earnings for the week:\n\\[\n\\$540 + \\$135 = \\$675\n\\]\n\nThus, Faith will earn \\(\\boxed{675}\\) dollars by the end of the week.",
        "To determine Faith's weekly earnings, we need to break down her pay into two parts: her regular pay and her overtime pay. Here's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. **Calculate the regular pay:**\n   - Faith works 8 hours a day.\n   - She works 5 days a week.\n   - Her hourly wage is $13.50.\n   - Regular pay = hours per day * days per week * hourly wage\n   - Regular pay = 8 * 5 * 13.50\n   - Regular pay = 40 * 13.50\n   - Regular pay = $540\n\n2. **Calculate the overtime pay:**\n   - Faith works 2 hours of overtime per day.\n   - She works 5 days a week.\n   - Her hourly wage for overtime is the same as her regular hourly wage, which is $13.50.\n   - Overtime pay = overtime hours per day * days per week * hourly wage\n   - Overtime pay = 2 * 5 * 13.50\n   - Overtime pay = 10 * 13.50\n   - Overtime pay = $135\n\n3. **Calculate the total pay:**\n   - Total pay = regular pay + overtime pay\n   - Total pay = $540 + $135\n   - Total pay = $675\n\nTherefore, Faith will earn \\(\\boxed{675}\\) dollars by the end of the week.",
