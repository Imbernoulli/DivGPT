        "To determine how many pieces of chocolate candy Lucas will make for his class on Monday, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of students Lucas had last Monday:**\n   Lucas made 40 pieces of chocolate candy, and he made 4 pieces for each student. Therefore, the number of students last Monday is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students last Monday} = \\frac{40 \\text{ pieces}}{4 \\text{ pieces per student}} = 10 \\text{ students}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of students who will be coming to class this Monday:**\n   This upcoming Monday, 3 of Lucas' students will not be coming to class. Therefore, the number of students who will be coming to class is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of students this Monday} = 10 \\text{ students} - 3 \\text{ students} = 7 \\text{ students}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of chocolate candy Lucas will make for his class on Monday:**\n   Lucas makes 4 pieces of chocolate candy for each student. Therefore, the total number of pieces of chocolate candy he will make this Monday is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pieces of chocolate candy this Monday} = 7 \\text{ students} \\times 4 \\text{ pieces per student} = 28 \\text{ pieces}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of pieces of chocolate candy Lucas will make for his class on Monday is \\(\\boxed{28}\\).",
