        "To determine how many trading cards Jim gave away, we need to calculate the total number of cards in each set he gave to his brother, sister, and friend, and then sum these amounts. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of cards Jim gave to his brother:\n   Jim gave 8 sets of cards to his brother. Since each set contains 13 cards, we multiply 8 by 13:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 13 = 104\n   \\]\n   So, Jim gave 104 cards to his brother.\n\n2. Calculate the number of cards Jim gave to his sister:\n   Jim gave 5 sets of cards to his sister. Since each set contains 13 cards, we multiply 5 by 13:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 13 = 65\n   \\]\n   So, Jim gave 65 cards to his sister.\n\n3. Calculate the number of cards Jim gave to his friend:\n   Jim gave 2 sets of cards to his friend. Since each set contains 13 cards, we multiply 2 by 13:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 13 = 26\n   \\]\n   So, Jim gave 26 cards to his friend.\n\n4. Add the number of cards given to his brother, sister, and friend to find the total number of cards given away:\n   \\[\n   104 + 65 + 26 = 195\n   \\]\n   So, Jim gave away a total of 195 cards.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cards Jim gave away is \\boxed{195}.",
