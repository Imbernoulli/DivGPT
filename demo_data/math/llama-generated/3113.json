        "To determine the number of 8-foot long planks Bob needs to construct 10 raised beds, we need to calculate the total length of lumber required for one raised bed and then multiply by 10.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total length of lumber needed for one raised bed. Each raised bed has four sides, and the dimensions of each side are 2 feet high and 8 feet long, or 2 feet wide and 8 feet long. Since the planks are 1 foot wide, each side will require 2 planks (one for each foot of height).\n\nThe total length of lumber needed for the two longer sides (each 8 feet long and 2 feet high) is:\n\\[2 \\text{ planks} \\times 8 \\text{ feet} \\times 2 \\text{ sides} = 32 \\text{ feet}\\]\n\nThe total length of lumber needed for the two shorter sides (each 2 feet long and 2 feet high) is:\n\\[2 \\text{ planks} \\times 2 \\text{ feet} \\times 2 \\text{ sides} = 8 \\text{ feet}\\]\n\nAdding these together gives the total length of lumber needed for one raised bed:\n\\[32 \\text{ feet} + 8 \\text{ feet} = 40 \\text{ feet}\\]\n\nSince Bob is building 10 raised beds, the total length of lumber needed is:\n\\[40 \\text{ feet/bed} \\times 10 \\text{ beds} = 400 \\text{ feet}\\]\n\nSince the lumber is sold in 8-foot-long boards, the number of boards needed is:\n\\[\\frac{400 \\text{ feet}}{8 \\text{ feet/board}} = 50 \\text{ boards}\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of 8-foot long planks Bob will need to construct 10 raised beds is:\n\\[\\boxed{50}\\]",
        "To determine how many 8-foot long planks Bob will need to construct 10 raised beds, we need to first calculate the total amount of lumber required for one raised bed and then multiply by 10.\n\nEach raised bed has the following dimensions: 2 feet high, 2 feet wide, and 8 feet long. The sides of the bed are built of 1-foot wide planks. Therefore, each bed will have:\n\n- Two ends, each 2 feet high and 2 feet wide, requires \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) square feet of lumber per end, so \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) square feet for both ends.\n- Two sides, each 2 feet high and 8 feet long, requires \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) square feet of lumber per side, so \\(2 \\times 16 = 32\\) square feet for both sides.\n\nAdding these together, the total amount of lumber needed for one raised bed is:\n\\[8 + 32 = 40 \\text{ square feet}.\\]\n\nSince Bob is buying his lumber in 8-foot-long boards, we need to determine how many planks are required for one raised bed. Each plank is 1 foot wide and 8 feet long, so each plank provides 8 square feet of lumber. Therefore, the number of planks needed for one raised bed is:\n\\[40 \\div 8 = 5 \\text{ planks}.\\]\n\nSince Bob is constructing 10 raised beds, the total number of planks needed is:\n\\[5 \\times 10 = 50 \\text{ planks}.\\]\n\nThus, the number of 8-foot long planks Bob will need to construct 10 raised beds is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).",
        "To determine how many 8-foot long planks Bob needs to construct 10 raised beds, we first need to calculate the total amount of lumber required for one bed and then multiply by 10.\n\nEach raised bed has four sides. Two of the sides are 8 feet long and 2 feet high, and the other two sides are 2 feet long and 2 feet high. Since the planks are 1 foot wide, each side will require a certain number of planks.\n\nFor the two longer sides:\n- Each side is 8 feet long and 2 feet high, so it requires \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\) planks.\n- Therefore, the two longer sides together require \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\) planks.\n\nFor the two shorter sides:\n- Each side is 2 feet long and 2 feet high, so it requires \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) planks.\n- Therefore, the two shorter sides together require \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) planks.\n\nAdding the planks needed for all four sides gives us the total number of planks required for one bed:\n\\[32 + 8 = 40\\]\n\nSince Bob is building 10 raised beds, the total number of planks needed is:\n\\[40 \\times 10 = 400\\]\n\nSince each plank is 8 feet long, we need to determine how many 8-foot long boards are required to get 400 planks:\n\\[400 \\div 8 = 50\\]\n\nTherefore, Bob will need \\(\\boxed{50}\\) 8-foot long planks to construct 10 raised beds."
