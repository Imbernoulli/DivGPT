        "To determine how many flyers Donna dropped off, we start by identifying the number of flyers Maisie dropped off. According to the problem, Maisie dropped off 33 flyers.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of flyers Donna dropped off. The problem states that Donna dropped off five more than twice as many flyers as Maisie. We can express this relationship mathematically as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of flyers Donna dropped off} = 2 \\times \\text{Number of flyers Maisie dropped off} + 5\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the number of flyers Maisie dropped off into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of flyers Donna dropped off} = 2 \\times 33 + 5\n\\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\(2 \\times 33\\):\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 33 = 66\n\\]\n\nThen, we add 5 to 66:\n\n\\[\n66 + 5 = 71\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of flyers Donna dropped off is \\(\\boxed{71}\\).",
