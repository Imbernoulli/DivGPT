        "To determine how many quarters Libby will have left after replacing her sister's dress, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total value of the quarters Libby has.\n2. Calculate how many quarters are needed to pay $35.\n3. Subtract the number of quarters used to pay $35 from the total number of quarters Libby initially had.\n\nFirst, let's find the total value of the quarters Libby has. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, and Libby has 160 quarters, we calculate:\n\n\\[ 160 \\text{ quarters} \\times 0.25 \\text{ dollars/quarter} = 40 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many quarters are required to pay $35. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we divide $35 by $0.25:\n\n\\[ 35 \\text{ dollars} \\div 0.25 \\text{ dollars/quarter} = 140 \\text{ quarters} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of quarters used to pay $35 from the total number of quarters Libby initially had:\n\n\\[ 160 \\text{ quarters} - 140 \\text{ quarters} = 20 \\text{ quarters} \\]\n\nTherefore, after replacing the dress, Libby will have \\(\\boxed{20}\\) quarters left.",
        "To determine how many quarters Libby will have left after replacing her sister's dress, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the value of the quarters Libby has:**\n   Libby has 160 quarters.

Subtract the value of the quarters used to pay for the dress from the total value of the quarters.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of the quarters Libby has. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:\n\\[ 160 \\times 0.25 = 40 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the cost of replacing the dress in quarters. The dress costs $35, so we convert this amount into quarters by dividing by the value of each quarter:\n\\[ 35 \\div 0.25 = 140 \\text{ quarters} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of quarters used to pay for the dress from the total number of quarters Libby has:\n\\[ 160 - 140 = 20 \\text{ quarters} \\]\n\nTherefore, after replacing the dress, Libby will have \\(\\boxed{20}\\) quarters left.",
        "To determine how many quarters Libby will have left after paying for her sister's dress, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the cost of the dress into quarters:**\n   Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we need to find out how many quarters make up $35.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of quarters} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of the dress}}{\\text{Value of each quarter}} = \\frac{35}{0.25}\n   \\]\n\n   To divide 35 by 0.25, we can multiply 35 by 4 (since dividing by 0.25 is the same as multiplying by 4):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{35}{0.25} = 35 \\times 4 = 140\n   \\]\n\n   So, $35 is equivalent to 140 quarters.\n\n2. **Subtract the number of quarters used to pay for the dress from the total number of quarters Libby has:**\n   Libby initially has 160 quarters.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quarters left} = \\text{Initial number of quarters} - \\text{Number of quarters used} = 160 - 140 = 20\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, after replacing the dress, Libby will have \\boxed{20} quarters left.",

Subtract the number of quarters used to pay for the dress from the total number of quarters Libby initially had.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of the quarters Libby currently has. Since each quarter is worth $0.25 and Libby has 160 quarters, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:\n\\[ 160 \\times 0.25 = 40 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many quarters are equivalent to $35. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we divide $35 by $0.25:\n\\[ 35 \\div 0.25 = 140 \\text{ quarters} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of quarters used to pay for the dress from the total number of quarters Libby initially had:\n\\[ 160 - 140 = 20 \\text{ quarters} \\]\n\nTherefore, after replacing the dress, Libby will have \\(\\boxed{20}\\) quarters left.",
