Since each ring-binder costs $18, the total cost for three ring-binders is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 18 = 54 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the cost of the backpack and the total cost of the three ring-binders to find the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store:\n\\[ 55 + 54 = 109 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store is:\n\\[ \\boxed{109} \\]",
