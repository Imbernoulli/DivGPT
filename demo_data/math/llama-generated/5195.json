        "To determine the total number of times Billy, John, and their mother rode their bikes, we need to calculate the number of times each person rode their bike and then sum these values.\n\nFirst, we know that Billy rode his bike 17 times. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Billy's rides} = 17 \\]\n\nNext, we know that John rode his bike twice as many times as Billy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of times John rode his bike as follows:\n\\[ \\text{John's rides} = 2 \\times 17 = 34 \\]\n\nThen, we know that their mother rode her bike 10 times more than John. Therefore, we can calculate the number of times their mother rode her bike as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Mother's rides} = 34 + 10 = 44 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of rides for Billy, John, and their mother to find the total number of times they rode their bikes:\n\\[ \\text{Total rides} = \\text{Billy's rides} + \\text{John's rides} + \\text{Mother's rides} = 17 + 34 + 44 \\]\n\nAdding these values together, we get:\n\\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \\]\n\\[ 51 + 44 = 95 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of times they rode their bikes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{95} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of times Billy, John, and their mother rode their bikes, we need to calculate each person's individual count and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that Billy rode his bike 17 times. Therefore, the number of times Billy rode his bike is:\n\\[ \\text{Billy} = 17 \\]\n\nNext, we know that John rode his bike twice as many times as Billy. So, we calculate the number of times John rode his bike by multiplying Billy's count by 2:\n\\[ \\text{John} = 2 \\times 17 = 34 \\]\n\nThen, we know that their mother rode her bike 10 times more than John. So, we calculate the number of times their mother rode her bike by adding 10 to John's count:\n\\[ \\text{Mother} = 34 + 10 = 44 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of times each person rode their bike to find the total number of times they all rode their bikes:\n\\[ \\text{Total} = \\text{Billy} + \\text{John} + \\text{Mother} = 17 + 34 + 44 \\]\n\nAdding these values together, we get:\n\\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \\]\n\\[ 51 + 44 = 95 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of times they rode their bikes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{95} \\]",

Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 17 = 34\n   \\]\n   John rode his bike 34 times.\n\n3. **Mother's Rides:**\n   Their mother rode her bike 10 times more than John. Therefore, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   34 + 10 = 44\n   \\]\n   Their mother rode her bike 44 times.\n\n4. **Total Rides:**\n   To find the total number of times they all rode their bikes, we add the number of times each person rode:\n   \\[\n   17 + 34 + 44\n   \\]\n\n   Let's perform the addition step-by-step:\n   \\[\n   17 + 34 = 51\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   51 + 44 = 95\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of times they rode their bikes is \\(\\boxed{95}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of times Billy, John, and their mother rode their bikes, we will calculate the number of times each person rode their bike and then sum these values.\n\n1. First, we know that Billy rode his bike 17 times.\n2. John rode his bike twice as many times as Billy. Therefore, we calculate the number of times John rode his bike as follows:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 17 = 34\n   \\]\n   So, John rode his bike 34 times.\n3. Their mother rode her bike 10 times more than John. Therefore, we calculate the number of times their mother rode her bike as follows:\n   \\[\n   34 + 10 = 44\n   \\]\n   So, their mother rode her bike 44 times.\n\nNext, we sum the number of times each person rode their bike:\n\\[\n17 + 34 + 44\n\\]\n\nWe can add these numbers step by step:\n\\[\n17 + 34 = 51\n\\]\n\\[\n51 + 44 = 95\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of times they rode their bikes is \\boxed{95}."
