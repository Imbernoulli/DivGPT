        "To determine how much Jay and Gloria would spend at the craft store, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of guests:**\n   Jay invited 22 people and Gloria invited 36 people. Therefore, the total number of guests is:\n   \\[\n   22 + 36 = 58\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the flags for Jay and Gloria:**\n   Jay and Gloria each want 1 flag. Therefore, the total number of flags needed is:\n   \\[\n   58 + 2 = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of sets of 5 flags:**\n   The craft store sells flags in sets of 5. To find out how many sets are needed, we divide the total number of flags by 5:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{5} = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   Each set of 5 flags costs $1.00.
