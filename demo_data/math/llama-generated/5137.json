She spent \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of her $200 on the DVD:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 200 = 100\n\\]\nSo, Rachel spent $100 on the DVD.\n\nNow, we add the amounts spent on lunch and the DVD to find the total amount spent:\n\\[\n50 + 100 = 150\n\\]\nSo, Rachel spent a total of $150.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money she earned to find out how much she has left:\n\\[\n200 - 150 = 50\n\\]\nSo, Rachel has \\(\\boxed{50}\\) dollars left.",
