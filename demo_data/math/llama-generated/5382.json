        "To determine what percent of the students are present in school, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the percentage of students who are not learning from home:**\n   Since 40% of the students have elected to learn from home, the remaining students are:\n   \\[\n   100\\% - 40\\% = 60\\%\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the percentage of the remaining students who are physically in school on any given day:**\n   The remaining 60% of the students are divided into two equal groups. Only one of these groups is physically in school on any given day. Therefore, the percentage of students present in school on any given day is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60\\%}{2} = 30\\%\n   \\]\n\nSo, the percent of students present in school is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
        "Let's denote the total number of students as \\( N \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of students who have elected to learn from home. Since 40% of the students are learning from home, the number of these students is:\n\\[ 0.4N \\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of students who are not learning from home. This is the total number of students minus the number of students learning from home:\n\\[ N - 0.4N = 0.6N \\]\n\nThese remaining students are divided into two equal groups, and only one of these groups is physically in school on any given day. Therefore, the number of students present in school on any given day is half of the remaining students:\n\\[ \\frac{0.6N}{2} = 0.3N \\]\n\nTo find the percentage of students present in school, we express the number of students present in school as a percentage of the total number of students:\n\\[ \\frac{0.3N}{N} \\times 100\\% = 30\\% \\]\n\nThus, the percent of students present in school is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",
        "To determine the percentage of students present in school, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the percentage of students learning from home:**\n   Given that 40% of the students have elected to learn from home, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage of students learning from home} = 40\\%\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the percentage of students not learning from home:**\n   Since the total percentage of students is 100%, the percentage of students not learning from home is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage of students not learning from home} = 100\\% - 40\\% = 60\\%\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the percentage of students physically in school on any day:**\n   The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, and only one of these groups is physically in school on any given day. Therefore, the percentage of students physically in school on any day is half of the percentage of students not learning from home:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage of students physically in school on any day} = \\frac{60\\%}{2} = 30\\%\n   \\]\n\nThus, the percentage of students present in school is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",
        "Let's denote the total number of students as \\(100\\%\\) for simplicity.\n\nFirst, we calculate the percentage of students who have elected to learn from home. According to the problem, 40% of the students are learning from home. Therefore, the percentage of students who are not learning from home is:\n\\[100\\% - 40\\% = 60\\%\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many of the remaining students are physically in school on any given day. The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, and only one of these groups is physically in school on any day. So, each group is:\n\\[60\\% \\div 2 = 30\\%\\]\n\nSince only one of these groups is in school on any given day, the percentage of students present in school is:\n\\[30\\%\\]\n\nThus, the percent of students present in school is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

This is the remaining 60% of the students:\n\\[ x - 0.4x = 0.6x \\]\n\nThese remaining students are divided into two equal groups, and only one of these groups is physically in school on any given day. Therefore, the number of students present in school on any given day is half of the remaining students:\n\\[ \\frac{0.6x}{2} = 0.3x \\]\n\nTo find the percentage of students present in school, we take the number of students present in school and divide it by the total number of students, then multiply by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{0.3x}{x} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.3 \\times 100 = 30\\% \\]\n\nThus, the percent of students present in school is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",

Since each group represents 30% of the total students, the percentage of students present in school on any given day is:\n     \\[\n     30\\%\n     \\]\n\nThus, the percentage of students present in school is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).",

Therefore, the percentage of students who are not learning from home is:\n\\[100\\% - 40\\% = 60\\%\\]\n\nNext, we need to divide the remaining students into two equal groups, with only one group physically in school on any given day.

Therefore, each group contains:\n\\[ \\frac{0.6N}{2} = 0.3N \\]\n\nSince only one of these groups is physically in school on any given day, the number of students present in school on any given day is:\n\\[ 0.3N \\]\n\nTo find the percentage of students present in school, we divide the number of students present in school by the total number of students and then multiply by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{0.3N}{N} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.3 \\times 100 = 30\\% \\]\n\nThus, the percent of students present in school is:\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]",
