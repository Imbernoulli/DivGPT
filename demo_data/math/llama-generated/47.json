According to the problem, the total revenue from all lemonades sold is $50. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ s \\cdot 1 + m \\cdot 2 + l \\cdot 3 = 50 \\]\n\nWe are also given that the total revenue from small lemonades is $11 and the total revenue from medium lemonades is $24. This gives us two more equations:\n\\[ s \\cdot 1 = 11 \\]\n\\[ m \\cdot 2 = 24 \\]\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for \\( s \\):\n\\[ s = 11 \\]\n\nFrom the second equation, we can solve for \\( m \\):\n\\[ m = \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\]\n\nNow, we substitute \\( s = 11 \\) and \\( m = 12 \\) into the total revenue equation:\n\\[ 11 \\cdot 1 + 12 \\cdot 2 + l \\cdot 3 = 50 \\]\n\\[ 11 + 24 + l \\cdot 3 = 50 \\]\n\\[ 35 + l \\cdot 3 = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( l \\) by subtracting 35 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ l \\cdot 3 = 15 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( l \\) by dividing both sides by 3:\n\\[ l = \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of large lemonades Tonya sold is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

        "To determine how many cups of large lemonade Tonya sold, we start by defining the variables for the number of small, medium, and large cups sold. Let:\n- \\( x \\) be the number of small cups sold,\n- \\( y \\) be the number of medium cups sold,\n- \\( z \\) be the number of large cups sold.\n\nWe know from the problem that the price of a small cup is $1, a medium cup is $2, and a large cup is $3. Tonya's total revenue is $50, and she sold $11 worth of small lemonades and $24 worth of medium lemonades.
