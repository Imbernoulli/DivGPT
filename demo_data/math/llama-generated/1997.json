        "To determine how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the number of necklaces Jason has:**\n   Haley has 5 more necklaces than Jason. Given that Haley has 25 necklaces, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   H = J + 5\n   \\]\n   where \\( H \\) is the number of necklaces Haley has and \\( J \\) is the number of necklaces Jason has. Since \\( H = 25 \\), we substitute this value into the equation:\n   \\[\n   25 = J + 5\n   \\]\n   To solve for \\( J \\), subtract 5 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   J = 25 - 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   J = 20\n   \\]\n   So, Jason has 20 necklaces.\n\n2. **Determine the number of necklaces Josh has:**\n   Josh has half the number of necklaces as Jason. Given that Jason has 20 necklaces, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   Josh = \\frac{J}{2}\n   \\]\n   where \\( Josh \\) is the number of necklaces Josh has and \\( J \\) is the number of necklaces Jason has. Since \\( J = 20 \\), we substitute this value into the equation:\n   \\[\n   Josh = \\frac{20}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Josh = 10\n   \\]\n   So, Josh has 10 necklaces.\n\n3. **Calculate how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh:**\n   To find out how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh, subtract the number of necklaces Josh has from the number of necklaces Haley has:\n   \\[\n   H - Josh = 25 - 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   H - Josh = 15\n   \\]\n   So, Haley has 15 more necklaces than Josh.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many more necklaces Haley has than Josh, we need to find out how many necklaces Jason and Josh have based on the information given.\n\nFirst, we know that Haley has 25 necklaces and she has 5 more necklaces than Jason.
