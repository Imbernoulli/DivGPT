        "To determine the depth of Peter's pond, we start by defining the depth of Peter's pond as \\( x \\) feet. According to the problem, Mark's pond is 4 feet deeper than 3 times the depth of Peter's pond. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Depth of Mark's pond} = 3x + 4 \\]\n\nWe know from the problem that Mark's pond is 19 feet deep. Therefore, we can substitute 19 for the depth of Mark's pond in the equation:\n\n\\[ 19 = 3x + 4 \\]\n\nNext, we need to solve for \\( x \\). We start by isolating the term with \\( x \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 19 - 4 = 3x \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 15 = 3x \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{15}{3} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the depth of Peter's pond is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) feet.",
