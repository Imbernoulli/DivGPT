This gives us another equation:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 150 - 4 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\times 150 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{5} \\times 150 = 3 \\times 30 = 90 \\]\n\nSo, Taro's score \\( T \\) is:\n\n\\[ T = 90 - 4 = 86 \\]\n\nNow, we substitute \\( T = 86 \\) back into the first equation \\( T + V = 150 \\):\n\n\\[ 86 + V = 150 \\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), we subtract 86 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ V = 150 - 86 = 64 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total points scored by Vlad is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]",
