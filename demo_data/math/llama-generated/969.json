        "To determine how many Easter eggs Hannah found, we start by defining the number of eggs Helen found as \\( x \\). According to the problem, Hannah found twice as many eggs as Helen, so Hannah found \\( 2x \\) eggs.\n\nThe total number of Easter eggs in the yard is the sum of the eggs found by Helen and Hannah. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ x + 2x = 63 \\]\n\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation gives:\n\\[ 3x = 63 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ x = \\frac{63}{3} = 21 \\]\n\nSo, Helen found 21 eggs. Since Hannah found twice as many eggs as Helen, we calculate the number of eggs Hannah found by multiplying Helen's number of eggs by 2:\n\\[ 2x = 2 \\times 21 = 42 \\]\n\nTherefore, Hannah found \\(\\boxed{42}\\) Easter eggs.",
