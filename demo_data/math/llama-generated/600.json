According to the problem, it takes him twice as long to fertilize the lawn as it does to mow it. Therefore, the time it takes to fertilize the lawn is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 40 = 80 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we add the time it takes to mow the lawn to the time it takes to fertilize the lawn:\n\\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, the total time it will take Max to both mow and fertilize the lawn is:\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]",

This is given in the problem.\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it takes Max to fertilize the lawn. The problem states that it takes him twice as long to fertilize the lawn as it does to mow it. Therefore, we multiply the time it takes to mow the lawn by 2:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ minutes} \\times 2 = 80 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we add the time it takes to mow the lawn and the time it takes to fertilize the lawn to find the total time:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ minutes} + 80 \\text{ minutes} = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, the total time it will take Max to both mow and fertilize the lawn is \\(\\boxed{120}\\) minutes.",
