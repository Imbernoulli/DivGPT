        "To determine how many pistachios in the bag have shells and have an opened shell, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of pistachios with shells:**\n   - The bag contains 80 pistachios.\n   - 95 percent of these pistachios have shells.\n   - Number of pistachios with shells = \\( 0.95 \\times 80 \\).\n\n   \\[\n   0.95 \\times 80 = 76\n   \\]\n\n   So, there are 76 pistachios with shells.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of pistachios with opened shells:**\n   - 75 percent of the pistachios with shells have opened shells.\n   - Number of pistachios with opened shells = \\( 0.75 \\times 76 \\).\n\n   \\[\n   0.75 \\times 76 = 57\n   \\]\n\n   So, there are 57 pistachios with opened shells.\n\nTherefore, the number of pistachios in the bag that have shells and have an opened shell is \\(\\boxed{57}\\).",
        "To determine how many pistachios in the bag have shells and have an opened shell, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pistachios that have shells.\n2. Calculate the number of pistachios that have shells and have an opened shell.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many pistachios have shells. We know that 95 percent of the 80 pistachios have shells. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.95 \\times 80 = 76\n\\]\nSo, there are 76 pistachios that have shells.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these 76 pistachios have shells that are opened. We know that 75 percent of the pistachios that have shells have shells that are opened. Therefore, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.75 \\times 76 = 57\n\\]\nSo, there are 57 pistachios that have shells and have an opened shell.\n\nThus, the number of pistachios in the bag that have shells and have an opened shell is \\boxed{57}.",
