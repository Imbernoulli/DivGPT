        "To determine how much weight John will move if he does three triples, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate John's current back squat weight.\n2. Determine John's front squat weight.\n3. Calculate the weight of one triple.\n4. Calculate the total weight moved in three triples.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate John's current back squat weight.**\n\nJohn used to back squat 200 kg and increased that by 50 kg.\n\\[\n200 \\text{ kg} + 50 \\text{ kg} = 250 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\nSo, John's current back squat weight is 250 kg.\n\n**Step 2: Determine John's front squat weight.**\n\nJohn can front squat 80% as much as he back squats.\n\\[\n0.80 \\times 250 \\text{ kg} = 200 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\nSo, John's front squat weight is 200 kg.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the weight of one triple.**\n\nJohn can do a triple equal to 90% of the amount he front squats.\n\\[\n0.90 \\times 200 \\text{ kg} = 180 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\nSo, the weight of one triple is 180 kg.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total weight moved in three triples.**\n\nIf John does three triples, the total weight moved is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 180 \\text{ kg} = 540 \\text{ kg}\n\\]\nSo, the total weight John will move if he does three triples is \\boxed{540} kg."
