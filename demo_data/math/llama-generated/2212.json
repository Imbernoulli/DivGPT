        "To determine the total number of baskets made by Alex, Sandra, and Hector, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of baskets Sandra made.\n2. Calculate the number of baskets Hector made.\n3. Add the number of baskets made by Alex, Sandra, and Hector together.\n\nFirst, we know that Alex made 8 baskets. Sandra made three times as many baskets as Alex. Therefore, we can calculate the number of baskets Sandra made as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of baskets Sandra made} = 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, Hector made two times the number of baskets that Sandra made. Therefore, we can calculate the number of baskets Hector made as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of baskets Hector made} = 2 \\times 24 = 48 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of baskets made by Alex, Sandra, and Hector together:\n\\[ \\text{Total number of baskets} = 8 + 24 + 48 = 80 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of baskets they made is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",

Therefore, we can calculate the number of baskets Hector made as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Hector's baskets} = 2 \\times \\text{Sandra's baskets} = 2 \\times 24 = 48\n\\]\n\nNow, we add up the baskets made by Alex, Sandra, and Hector:\n\\[\n\\text{Total baskets} = \\text{Alex's baskets} + \\text{Sandra's baskets} + \\text{Hector's baskets} = 8 + 24 + 48 = 80\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of baskets they made is \\boxed{80}.",

        "To determine the total number of baskets made by Alex, Sandra, and Hector, we need to calculate the number of baskets each person made and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we know that Alex made 8 baskets. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Baskets made by Alex} = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Sandra made three times as many baskets as Alex. Therefore, we calculate the number of baskets Sandra made as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Baskets made by Sandra} = 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Hector made two times the number of baskets that Sandra made. Therefore, we calculate the number of baskets Hector made as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Baskets made by Hector} = 2 \\times 24 = 48 \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of baskets made by Alex, Sandra, and Hector to find the total number of baskets:\n\\[ \\text{Total baskets} = 8 + 24 + 48 = 80 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of baskets made by Alex, Sandra, and Hector is \\(\\boxed{80}\\)."
