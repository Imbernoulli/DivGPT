        "Let's start by determining the number of tourists left after the two are eaten by anacondas. Initially, there are 30 tourists. After two are eaten, the number of tourists remaining is:\n\\[ 30 - 2 = 28 \\]\n\nNext, half of the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. So, the number of tourists who get poisoned is:\n\\[ \\frac{28}{2} = 14 \\]\n\nOnly \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) of the poisoned tourists recover. Therefore, the number of tourists who recover is:\n\\[ \\frac{14}{7} = 2 \\]\n\nThe number of tourists who do not recover (and thus die) is:\n\\[ 14 - 2 = 12 \\]\n\nFinally, the number of tourists left at the end of the tour is the initial number of tourists minus the number who died:\n\\[ 28 - 12 = 16 \\]\n\nThus, the number of tourists left at the end of the tour is:\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]",

After two are eaten, the number of tourists remaining is:\n\\[ 30 - 2 = 28. \\]\n\nNext, half of the remaining tourists try to pet poisonous dart frogs and get poisoned. So, we calculate half of 28:\n\\[ \\frac{28}{2} = 14. \\]\nThis means 14 tourists get poisoned.\n\nOut of the 14 poisoned tourists, only \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) recover. Therefore, the number of tourists who recover is:\n\\[ \\frac{14}{7} = 2. \\]\nThis means that 14 - 2 = 12 tourists do not recover and are no longer part of the group.\n\nThe number of tourists left at the end of the tour is the remaining tourists after the two were eaten minus the 12 who did not recover:\n\\[ 28 - 12 = 16. \\]\n\nThus, the number of tourists left at the end of the tour is:\n\\[ \\boxed{16}. \\]",
