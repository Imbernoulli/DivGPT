        "To determine how much Liz's team loses by at the end of the game, we need to calculate the total points Liz scores and then find out the final score difference between the two teams.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total points Liz scores:\n- Liz sinks 5 free throw shots. Each free throw is worth 1 point:\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 1 = 5 \\text{ points}\n  \\]\n- Liz sinks 3 three-pointers. Each three-pointer is worth 3 points:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ points}\n  \\]\n- Liz sinks 4 other jump shots. Each jump shot is worth 2 points:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ points}\n  \\]\n\nNext, we add up all the points Liz scores:\n\\[\n5 + 9 + 8 = 22 \\text{ points}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that Liz's team is initially down by 20 points. Liz scores 22 points, and the other team scores 10 points in the final quarter. We need to find the net change in the point difference between the two teams during the final quarter:\n\\[\n22 \\text{ points (Liz scores)} - 10 \\text{ points (other team scores)} = 12 \\text{ points}\n\\]\n\nThis means Liz's team gains 12 points in the final quarter. Since they were initially down by 20 points, we subtract the 12 points they gain from their initial deficit:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ points} - 12 \\text{ points} = 8 \\text{ points}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Liz's team loses by \\(\\boxed{8}\\) points at the end of the game.",

        "To determine how much Liz's team loses by at the end of the game, we need to calculate the total points Liz scores in the final quarter and then account for the points scored by the other team in that quarter.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the points Liz scores from each type of shot:\n- Liz makes 5 free throw shots. Since each free throw is worth 1 point, she scores \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\) points from free throws.\n- Liz makes 3 three-pointers. Since each three-pointer is worth 3 points, she scores \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) points from three-pointers.\n- Liz makes 4 other jump shots.

        "To determine how much Liz's team loses by at the end of the game, we need to calculate the total points Liz scores in the final quarter and then find out the net change in the score difference between the two teams.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total points Liz scores:\n- Liz makes 5 free throw shots. Since each free throw is worth 1 point, she scores \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\) points.\n- Liz makes 3 three-pointers. Since each three-pointer is worth 3 points, she scores \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) points.\n- Liz makes 4 other jump shots. Since each jump shot is worth 2 points, she scores \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) points.\n\nAdding these up, the total points Liz scores is:\n\\[5 + 9 + 8 = 22\\]\n\nNext, we know that the other team scores 10 points in the final quarter. Therefore, the net change in the score difference between the two teams is:\n\\[22 - 10 = 12\\]\n\nSince Liz's team was initially down by 20 points, the new score difference is:\n\\[20 - 12 = 8\\]\n\nThus, Liz's team loses by \\(\\boxed{8}\\) points at the end of the game.",

Since each jump shot is worth 2 points, she scores \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) points.\n\nNow, let's add up all the points Liz scores:\n\\[5 + 9 + 8 = 22\\]\nSo, Liz scores 22 points in the final quarter.\n\nThe other team scores 10 points in the final quarter. Therefore, the net change in the score difference between Liz's team and the other team in the final quarter is:\n\\[22 - 10 = 12\\]\nThis means Liz's team increases their lead by 12 points in the final quarter.\n\nSince Liz's team was initially down by 20 points, their final score difference is:\n\\[-20 + 12 = -8\\]\nThis means Liz's team loses by 8 points at the end of the game.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\\boxed{8}\\]",

        "To determine how much Liz's team loses by at the end of the game, we need to calculate the total points Liz scores in the final quarter and then combine that with the initial point difference between the two teams.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the points Liz scores from each type of shot:\n- Free throw shots: Liz sinks 5 free throw shots. Since each free throw is worth 1 point, she scores \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\) points from free throws.\n- Three-pointers: Liz sinks 3 three-pointers. Since each three-pointer is worth 3 points, she scores \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) points from three-pointers.\n- Jump shots: Liz sinks 4 jump shots. Since each jump shot is worth 2 points, she scores \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) points from jump shots.\n\nAdding these together gives the total points Liz scores in the final quarter:\n\\[5 + 9 + 8 = 22\\]\n\nNext, we know that the other team scores 10 points in the final quarter. Therefore, the net change in the point difference between the two teams in the final quarter is:\n\\[22 - 10 = 12\\]\n\nSince Liz's team was initially down by 20 points, after the final quarter, the point difference will be:\n\\[20 - 12 = 8\\]\n\nThus, Liz's team loses by \\(\\boxed{8}\\) points at the end of the game.",
