        "To determine how many hamburgers Tonya needs to eat to beat last year's winner, we start by identifying the total amount of hamburger consumed by last year's winner. Last year's winner ate 84 ounces.\n\nSince each hamburger is 4 ounces, we can calculate the number of hamburgers last year's winner ate by dividing the total ounces by the weight of each hamburger:\n\\[\n\\frac{84 \\text{ ounces}}{4 \\text{ ounces per hamburger}} = 21 \\text{ hamburgers}\n\\]\nTo beat last year's winner, Tonya needs to eat more than 21 hamburgers. Therefore, she needs to eat at least 22 hamburgers. To confirm, we can calculate the total amount of hamburger consumed if she eats 22 hamburgers:\n\\[\n22 \\text{ hamburgers} \\times 4 \\text{ ounces per hamburger} = 88 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\nSince 88 ounces is more than 84 ounces, eating 22 hamburgers will indeed beat last year's winner.\n\nThus, the number of hamburgers Tonya has to eat to beat last year's winner is \\boxed{22}.",

To find out how many hamburgers Tonya needs to eat, we divide the total amount of hamburger she needs to eat by the weight of each hamburger:\n\n\\[ 85 \\div 4 = 21.25 \\]\n\nSince Tonya cannot eat a fraction of a hamburger, she needs to eat at least 22 hamburgers to ensure she eats more than 84 ounces.\n\nTherefore, the number of hamburgers Tonya has to eat to beat last year's winner is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",
        "To determine how many hamburgers Tonya has to eat to beat last year's winner, we start by noting that each hamburger weighs 4 ounces and last year's winner ate 84 ounces. Tonya needs to eat more than 84 ounces to beat last year's winner. Let's calculate the number of hamburgers she needs to eat.\n\nFirst, we find out how many hamburgers correspond to 84 ounces:\n\\[\n\\frac{84 \\text{ ounces}}{4 \\text{ ounces per hamburger}} = 21 \\text{ hamburgers}\n\\]\nSince Tonya needs to eat more than 21 hamburgers to beat last year's winner, she has to eat at least 22 hamburgers. Therefore, the number of hamburgers Tonya has to eat to beat last year's winner is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{22}\n\\]",
        "To determine how many hamburgers Tonya has to eat to beat last year's winner, we start by noting the size of each hamburger and the total amount of hamburger consumed by last year's winner. Each hamburger is 4 ounces, and last year's winner ate 84 ounces.\n\nFirst, we calculate how many hamburgers last year's winner ate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of hamburgers last year's winner ate} = \\frac{84 \\text{ ounces}}{4 \\text{ ounces per hamburger}} = 21 \\text{ hamburgers}\n\\]\nTo beat last year's winner, Tonya needs to eat more than 21 hamburgers. Therefore, she needs to eat at least 22 hamburgers. We can verify this by calculating the total amount of hamburger consumed if she eats 22 hamburgers:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount of hamburger consumed if she eats 22 hamburgers} = 22 \\text{ hamburgers} \\times 4 \\text{ ounces per hamburger} = 88 \\text{ ounces}\n\\]\nSince 88 ounces is more than 84 ounces, eating 22 hamburgers will indeed beat last year's winner.

        "To determine how many hamburgers Tonya has to eat to beat last year's winner, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the total amount of hamburger eaten by last year's winner in ounces.\n2. Determine the weight of each hamburger.\n3. Calculate the number of hamburgers Tonya needs to eat to exceed the total amount eaten by last year's winner.\n\nFirst, we know that last year's winner ate 84 ounces. Each hamburger weighs 4 ounces. To find out how many hamburgers Tonya needs to eat to beat last year's winner, we need to calculate the number of hamburgers that correspond to 84 ounces and then add one more hamburger to exceed that amount.\n\nThe number of hamburgers last year's winner ate is:\n\\[ \\frac{84 \\text{ ounces}}{4 \\text{ ounces per hamburger}} = 21 \\text{ hamburgers} \\]\n\nTo beat last year's winner, Tonya needs to eat one more hamburger than 21.

Calculate the number of hamburgers Tonya needs to eat based on the weight of each hamburger.\n\nFirst, we know that last year's winner ate 84 ounces of hamburger. To beat this record, Tonya needs to eat more than 84 ounces. Since each hamburger weighs 4 ounces, we can find out how many hamburgers Tonya needs to eat by dividing 84 ounces by 4 ounces per hamburger and then adding 1 (to ensure she eats more than 84 ounces).\n\nLet's perform the division:\n\\[ 84 \\div 4 = 21 \\]\n\nThis means that 21 hamburgers weigh exactly 84 ounces. To beat last year's winner, Tonya needs to eat at least 22 hamburgers. Therefore, the number of hamburgers Tonya has to eat to beat last year's winner is:\n\\[ \\boxed{22} \\]",
