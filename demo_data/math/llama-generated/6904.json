Therefore, the number of oil changes he needs in a year is:\n\\[ \\frac{12000 \\text{ miles/year}}{3000 \\text{ miles/oil change}} = 4 \\text{ oil changes/year} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of free oil changes from the total number of oil changes needed.**\n\nJohn gets 1 free oil change each year. Therefore, the number of oil changes he has to pay for is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ oil changes/year} - 1 \\text{ free oil change/year} = 3 \\text{ oil changes/year} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the cost of the remaining oil changes.**\n\nEach oil change costs $50. Therefore, the cost of 3 oil changes is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ oil changes} \\times 50 \\text{ dollars/oil change} = 150 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the amount John pays a year is:\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]",

Therefore, the number of oil changes he needs in a year is:\n\\[ \\frac{12000 \\text{ miles/year}}{3000 \\text{ miles/oil change}} = 4 \\text{ oil changes/year} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of free oil changes from the total number of oil changes needed.**\n\nJohn gets 1 free oil change a year. Therefore, the number of oil changes he pays for is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ oil changes/year} - 1 \\text{ free oil change/year} = 3 \\text{ oil changes/year} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the oil changes John pays.**\n\nEach oil change costs $50. Therefore, the total cost for 3 oil changes is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ oil changes/year} \\times 50 \\text{ dollars/oil change} = 150 \\text{ dollars/year} \\]\n\nThus, the amount John pays a year is:\n\\[ \\boxed{150} \\]",
