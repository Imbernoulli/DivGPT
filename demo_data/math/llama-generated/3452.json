We know that there were twice as many adult women as adult men:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of adult women} = 2 \\times 600 = 1200\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of children involved. We know the total number of community members is 2000, so we subtract the number of adult men and adult women from this total:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of children} = 2000 - 600 - 1200 = 200\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of children involved in the cleaning event is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{200}\n\\]",

Therefore, we calculate the number of adult men as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of adult men} = 0.30 \\times 2000 = 600\n\\]\n\nNext, we are given that there were twice as many adult women as adult men. Therefore, we calculate the number of adult women as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of adult women} = 2 \\times 600 = 1200\n\\]\n\nNow, we know the total number of adult men and adult women, so we can find the number of children by subtracting the sum of the number of adult men and adult women from the total number of community members. This is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of children} = 2000 - (600 + 1200) = 2000 - 1800 = 200\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of children involved in the cleaning event is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{200}\n\\]",
