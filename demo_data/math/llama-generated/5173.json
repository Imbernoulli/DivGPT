        "Let's start by determining how many days it took Ethan to learn the 12 fencing tricks. We know that Alexa was on vacation for \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of the time it took Ethan to learn the tricks, and that Alexa spent a week and 2 days on vacation. First, we need to convert the time Alexa spent on vacation into days. A week is 7 days, so a week and 2 days is:\n\n\\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSince Alexa was on vacation for \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of the time it took Ethan to learn the tricks, we can set up the following equation where \\( E \\) is the number of days it took Ethan to learn the tricks:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} E = 9 \\]\n\nTo find \\( E \\), we solve for \\( E \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\):\n\n\\[ E = 9 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 12 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSo, it took Ethan 12 days to learn the 12 fencing tricks. Joey spent half as much time as Ethan learning to swim, so we calculate the time Joey spent learning to swim as follows:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, it took Joey \\(\\boxed{6}\\) days to learn swimming.",
        "To determine how many days Joey spent learning to swim, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total time Ethan spent learning the 12 fencing tricks.\n2. Use Ethan's time to find out how long Alexa was on vacation.\n3. Use Ethan's time to find out how long Joey spent learning to swim.\n\nFirst, let's denote the time Ethan spent learning the 12 fencing tricks as \\( E \\) days. According to the problem, Alexa was on vacation for \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the time Ethan spent learning the tricks. We know that Alexa spent a week and 2 days on vacation, which is equivalent to \\( 7 + 2 = 9 \\) days. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} E = 9\n\\]\nTo find \\( E \\), we solve for \\( E \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\):\n\\[\nE = 9 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 12\n\\]\nSo, Ethan spent 12 days learning the 12 fencing tricks.\n\nNext, we know that Joey spent half as much time as Ethan learning to swim.

Use Ethan's time to find out how many days Alexa was on vacation.\n3. Use Ethan's time to find out how many days Joey spent learning to swim.\n\nFirst, we know that Alexa was on vacation for 3/4ths of the time it took Ethan to learn 12 fencing tricks. Alexa spent a week and 2 days on vacation. Converting weeks to days, we get:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ week} = 7 \\text{ days} \\]\nSo, a week and 2 days is:\n\\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSince Alexa was on vacation for 3/4ths of the time it took Ethan, we can set up the following equation where \\( E \\) is the number of days it took Ethan to learn the tricks:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4}E = 9 \\]\n\nTo find \\( E \\), we solve for \\( E \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), which is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\):\n\\[ E = 9 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 12 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nSo, it took Ethan 12 days to learn the 12 fencing tricks. Joey spent half as much time as Ethan learning to swim. Therefore, the number of days Joey spent learning to swim is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}E = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nThus, the number of days it took Joey to learn swimming is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",

Alexa spent a week and 2 days on vacation. Since a week is 7 days, a week and 2 days is \\(7 + 2 = 9\\) days. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the time Ethan spent learning the tricks:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\text{ (time Ethan spent)} = 9 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nTo find the time Ethan spent, we solve for the unknown time by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), which is the same as multiplying by \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{time Ethan spent} = 9 \\text{ days} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 12 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Ethan spent 12 days learning the tricks, we can find out how much time Joey spent learning to swim. Joey spent half as much time as Ethan spent learning the tricks:\n\n\\[\n\\text{time Joey spent} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 \\text{ days} = 6 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of days Joey spent learning to swim is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",

Calculate the time Joey spent learning to swim.\n\n**Step 1: Convert Alexa's vacation time into days.**\n\nAlexa spent a week and 2 days on vacation. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total number of days Alexa spent on vacation as follows:\n\\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \\text{ days} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total time Ethan spent learning the fencing tricks.**\n\nAlexa was on vacation for \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the time it took Ethan to learn the fencing tricks. Let \\( E \\) be the number of days Ethan spent learning the fencing tricks. According to the problem, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4}E = 9 \\]\n\nTo find \\( E \\), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), which is \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\):\n\\[ E = 9 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 12 \\text{ days} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the time Joey spent learning to swim.**\n\nJoey spent half as much time as Ethan learning to swim.
