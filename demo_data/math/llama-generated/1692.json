        "To determine how many four-minute songs Minnie needs to add to make the playlist exactly one hour long, we start by calculating the total length of the 16 three-minute songs.\n\nFirst, we multiply the number of three-minute songs by their duration:\n\\[ 16 \\times 3 = 48 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more minutes are required to make the playlist one hour long.
