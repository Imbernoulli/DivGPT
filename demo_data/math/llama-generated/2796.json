To find out how many years it will take for her to be 25 years old, we subtract her current age from 25:\n   \\[\n   25 - 19 = 6\n   \\]\n\nThus, Diane will be 25 years old in \\(\\boxed{6}\\) years.",
        "To determine in how many years Diane will be 25 years old, we start by finding out Denise's current age. We know that Denise will be 25 years old in two years, so her current age is:\n\\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find Diane's current age. Since Diane is 4 years younger than Denise, her current age is:\n\\[ 23 - 4 = 19 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many years it will take for Diane to reach 25 years old. We do this by subtracting her current age from 25:\n\\[ 25 - 19 = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, in \\(\\boxed{6}\\) years, Diane will be 25 years old."
