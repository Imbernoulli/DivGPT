        "First, we calculate the total number of baby mice Brenda had. Since each of the three litters had 8 baby mice, the total number of baby mice is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nNext, we determine how many baby mice Brenda gave to her friend Robbie. She gave a sixth of the baby mice to Robbie, so:\n\\[ \\frac{24}{6} = 4 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate how many baby mice Brenda sold to the pet store. She sold three times the number of babies she gave to Robbie, so:\n\\[ 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\]\n\nNow, we find out how many baby mice Brenda had left after giving some to Robbie and selling some to the pet store. Initially, she had 24 baby mice, and she gave away 4 and sold 12, so:\n\\[ 24 - 4 - 12 = 8 \\]\n\nHalf of the remaining baby mice were sold to snake owners. Therefore, the number of baby mice sold to snake owners is:\n\\[ \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate how many baby mice Brenda had left after selling half of the remaining baby mice to snake owners. She had 8 baby mice left before selling half, so:\n\\[ 8 - 4 = 4 \\]\n\nThus, the number of baby mice Brenda had left is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]",
