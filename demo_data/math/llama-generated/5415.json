        "To determine the total number of books that Harry, Flora, and Gary own together, we need to calculate the number of books each person has and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we know that Harry has 50 books. So, we write:\n\\[ \\text{Harry's books} = 50 \\]\n\nNext, we are told that Flora has twice as many books as Harry. Therefore, we calculate the number of books Flora has by multiplying Harry's number of books by 2:\n\\[ \\text{Flora's books} = 2 \\times 50 = 100 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Gary has half the number of books that Harry has. Therefore, we calculate the number of books Gary has by dividing Harry's number of books by 2:\n\\[ \\text{Gary's books} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\]\n\nNow, we sum the number of books that Harry, Flora, and Gary have:\n\\[ \\text{Total books} = \\text{Harry's books} + \\text{Flora's books} + \\text{Gary's books} = 50 + 100 + 25 = 175 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of books that the three of them own together is:\n\\[ \\boxed{175} \\]",
