Therefore, the amount recharged is:\n\\[\n\\frac{5000}{2} = 2500\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the amount recharged from his total earnings to find out how much money he has left after recharging his debit card:\n\\[\n5000 - 2500 = 2500\n\\]\n\nThen, we subtract the cost of the used car from the remaining amount:\n\\[\n2500 - 1500 = 1000\n\\]\n\nSo, Brendan's total amount of remaining money at the end of the month is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1000}\n\\]",
