At the highest setting, it vibrates 60% faster. First, we find 60% of 1600:\n\n\\[ 0.60 \\times 1600 = 960 \\]\n\nAdding this to the original frequency gives us the frequency at the highest setting:\n\n\\[ 1600 + 960 = 2560 \\]\n\nSo, the massager vibrates at 2560 vibrations per second at the highest setting.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total time Matt uses the massager in seconds.**\n\nMatt uses the massager for 5 minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 5 minutes to seconds:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 60 = 300 \\]\n\nSo, Matt uses the massager for 300 seconds.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of vibrations.**\n\nTo find the total number of vibrations, we multiply the frequency at the highest setting by the total time used:\n\n\\[ 2560 \\times 300 = 768000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of vibrations Matt experiences is \\(\\boxed{768000}\\)."
