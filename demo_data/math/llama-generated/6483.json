        "Let's start by calculating the amount of money Lisa's mother gave her. Her mother gave her \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) times what Lisa had saved. Since Lisa had saved $1200, we can calculate her mother's contribution as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mother's contribution} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 1200 = \\frac{3 \\times 1200}{5} = \\frac{3600}{5} = 720\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much Lisa's brother gave her. Her brother gave her twice the amount her mother gave her. Since her mother gave her $720, we can calculate her brother's contribution as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Brother's contribution} = 2 \\times 720 = 1440\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of money Lisa has after receiving contributions from her mother and her brother. This total amount is the sum of the money Lisa originally saved, the money her mother gave her, and the money her brother gave her:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount} = 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, Lisa still had $400 less than the total amount needed to buy the gift. Therefore, the price of the gift is $400 more than the total amount Lisa has:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price of the gift} = 3360 + 400 = 3760\n\\]\n\nSo, the price of the gift Lisa wanted to buy is \\(\\boxed{3760}\\).",
