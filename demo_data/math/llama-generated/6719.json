        "To determine how many fruits Mary has left after eating some, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the initial total number of fruits Mary bought.\n2. Subtract the number of fruits she ate from the initial total.\n\nFirst, let's find the initial total number of fruits Mary bought:\n- Mary bought 14 apples.\n- Mary bought 9 oranges.\n- Mary bought 6 blueberries.\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[ 14 + 9 + 6 = 29 \\]\n\nSo, Mary initially has 29 fruits.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of fruits she ate.
