        "To determine how many pages remain in the pad of paper after Sammy uses some for his science project and math homework, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of pages Sammy uses for his science project.\n2. Subtract the pages used for the science project from the total number of pages.\n3. Subtract the pages used for his math homework from the remaining pages.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pages Sammy uses for his science project. Sammy uses 25% of the 120 pages. We can find 25% of 120 by multiplying 120 by 0.25:\n\\[ 120 \\times 0.25 = 30 \\]\nSo, Sammy uses 30 pages for his science project.\n\nNext, we subtract the 30 pages used for the science project from the total number of pages:\n\\[ 120 - 30 = 90 \\]\nSo, there are 90 pages left after the science project.\n\nThen, we subtract the 10 pages used for his math homework from the remaining 90 pages:\n\\[ 90 - 10 = 80 \\]\nSo, there are 80 pages left after the math homework.\n\nTherefore, the number of pages that remain in the pad is \\(\\boxed{80}\\).",

Subtract the pages used for his math homework from the remaining pages.\n\nLet's start with the first step. Sammy uses 25% of the pages for his science project. Since the pad has 120 pages, we calculate:\n\\[ 25\\% \\text{ of } 120 = 0.25 \\times 120 = 30 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the pages used for the science project from the total number of pages:\n\\[ 120 - 30 = 90 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nThen, we subtract the pages used for his math homework from the remaining pages. Sammy uses 10 pages for his math homework, so we calculate:\n\\[ 90 - 10 = 80 \\text{ pages} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of pages remaining in the pad is:\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]",

Calculate the number of pages Sammy uses for his science project.\n2. Subtract the pages used for the science project from the total number of pages.\n3. Subtract the pages used for his math homework from the remaining pages.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pages Sammy uses for his science project. He uses 25% of the 120 pages. We can find 25% of 120 by multiplying 120 by 0.25:\n\\[ 120 \\times 0.25 = 30 \\]\nSo, Sammy uses 30 pages for his science project.\n\nNext, we subtract the 30 pages used for the science project from the total number of pages:\n\\[ 120 - 30 = 90 \\]\nSo, there are 90 pages remaining after the science project.\n\nThen, we subtract the 10 pages used for his math homework from the remaining 90 pages:\n\\[ 90 - 10 = 80 \\]\nSo, there are 80 pages remaining after the math homework.\n\nTherefore, the number of pages remaining in the pad is \\(\\boxed{80}\\)."
