        "To determine the number of apartments that have only one resident, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of apartments that have at least 1 resident.\n2. Calculate the number of apartments that have at least 2 residents.\n3. Subtract the number of apartments with at least 2 residents from the number of apartments with at least 1 resident to find the number of apartments with only 1 resident.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The total number of apartments is 120.

Since 60% of the apartments have at least 2 residents, we can calculate this as follows:\n\\[\n0.60 \\times 120 = 72\n\\]\nSo, 72 apartments have at least 2 residents.\n\nTo find the number of apartments that have only 1 resident, we subtract the number of apartments with at least 2 residents from the number of apartments with at least 1 resident:\n\\[\n102 - 72 = 30\n\\]\nSo, the number of apartments that have only one resident is \\boxed{30}.",
