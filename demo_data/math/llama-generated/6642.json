        "Let's denote Maiya's age as \\( M \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the first sister is twice as old as Maiya. Therefore, the first sister's age is \\( 2M \\).\n\nThe second sister is 1 year younger than Maiya. Therefore, the second sister's age is \\( M - 1 \\).\n\nThe average age of Maiya and her two sisters is given as 5. The average age can be calculated by adding their ages together and then dividing by the number of people (which is 3 in this case). So, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{M + 2M + (M - 1)}{3} = 5\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's simplify the numerator by combining like terms:\n\n\\[\nM + 2M + (M - 1) = 4M - 1\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute this back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4M - 1}{3} = 5\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[\n4M - 1 = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, add 1 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( M \\):\n\n\\[\n4M = 16\n\\]\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \\( M \\):\n\n\\[\nM = 4\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Maiya is \\(\\boxed{4}\\) years old.",

The average age of Maiya and her two sisters is 5.\n\nThe formula for the average age is:\n\\[\n\\text{Average age} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of ages}}{\\text{Number of people}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we get:\n\\[\n5 = \\frac{M + 2M + (M - 1)}{3}\n\\]\n\nFirst, simplify the sum inside the numerator:\n\\[\nM + 2M + (M - 1) = M + 2M + M - 1 = 4M - 1\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute this back into the average formula:\n\\[\n5 = \\frac{4M - 1}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( M \\), multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the denominator:\n\\[\n5 \\times 3 = 4M - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n15 = 4M - 1\n\\]\n\nNext, add 1 to both sides to isolate the term with \\( M \\):\n\\[\n15 + 1 = 4M\n\\]\n\\[\n16 = 4M\n\\]\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \\( M \\):\n\\[\nM = \\frac{16}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nM = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, Maiya is \\(\\boxed{4}\\) years old.",

        "To determine Maiya's age, let's define the ages of Maiya and her sisters using variables. Let's say Maiya's age is \\( M \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the first sister is twice as old as Maiya. Therefore, the first sister's age is \\( 2M \\).\n\nThe second sister is 1 year younger than Maiya. Therefore, the second sister's age is \\( M - 1 \\).\n\nThe average age of Maiya and her two sisters is given as 5. The average age can be calculated by dividing the sum of their ages by 3. So, we can write the equation for the average age as:\n\\[\n\\frac{M + 2M + (M - 1)}{3} = 5\n\\]\n\nFirst, we simplify the expression inside the numerator:\n\\[\nM + 2M + (M - 1) = 4M - 1\n\\]\n\nNow, we substitute this back into the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{4M - 1}{3} = 5\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[\n4M - 1 = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( M \\) by adding 1 to both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n4M = 16\n\\]\n\nFinally, we solve for \\( M \\) by dividing both sides by 4:\n\\[\nM = 4\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Maiya is \\(\\boxed{4}\\) years old.",

        "Let's denote Maiya's age as \\( x \\). According to the problem,ima has two sisters. The first sister is twice as old as Maiya, so her age is \\( 2x \\). The second sister is 1 year younger than Maiya, so her age is \\( x - 1 \\).\n\nThe average age of Maiya and her two sisters is given as 5. The average age can be calculated by dividing the sum of their ages by the number of people (which is 3 in this case).
