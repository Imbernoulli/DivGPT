        "To determine how much John received from his two grandparents, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the amount John gets from his grandma:**\n   John gets 3 times as much from his grandma as he does from his grandpa. Since he gets $30 from his grandpa, we multiply $30 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 30 = 90\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the amounts from both grandparents:**\n   John gets $30 from his grandpa and $90 from his grandma. To find the total amount, we add these two amounts together:\n   \\[\n   30 + 90 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount John gets from his two grandparents is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
