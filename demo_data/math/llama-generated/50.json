Since each mat requires 30 orange straws, the number of green straws needed is:\n\\[\n\\frac{30}{2} = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of straws needed for one mat by adding the number of red, orange, and green straws:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ (red)} + 30 \\text{ (orange)} + 15 \\text{ (green)} = 65\n\\]\n\nNow, to find out how many straws are needed for 10 mats, we multiply the total number of straws needed for one mat by 10:\n\\[\n65 \\times 10 = 650\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of straws Ginger needs to make 10 mats is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{650}\n\\]",
