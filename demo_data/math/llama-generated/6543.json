        "To determine the cost of the book, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the cost of the CD:**\n   - The CD is 30% cheaper than a $20 album.\n   - First, calculate 30% of $20:\n     \\[\n     0.30 \\times 20 = 6\n     \\]\n   - Subtract this amount from the original price of the album to find the cost of the CD:\n     \\[\n     20 - 6 = 14\n     \\]\n   Therefore, the CD costs $14.\n\n2. **Find the cost of the book:**\n   - The book costs $4 more than the CD.\n   - Add $4 to the cost of the CD:\n     \\[\n     14 + 4 = 18\n     \\]\n   Therefore, the book costs $18.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of the book, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the cost of the CD.\n2. Use the cost of the CD to find the cost of the book.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of the CD. The CD is 30% cheaper than a $20 album. This means the CD costs 70% of the $20 album. We calculate 70% of $20 as follows:\n\\[\n0.70 \\times 20 = 14\n\\]\nSo, the CD costs $14.\n\nNext, we know that the book costs $4 more than the CD. Therefore, we add $4 to the cost of the CD to find the cost of the book:\n\\[\n14 + 4 = 18\n\\]\nSo, the book costs \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

We can calculate this as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of CD} = 20 \\times (1 - 0.30) = 20 \\times 0.70 = 14\n\\]\nSo, the CD costs $14.\n\nNext, we know that the book costs $4 more than the CD. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the book as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of book} = \\text{Cost of CD} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18\n\\]\nSo, the book costs \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
        "To determine the cost of the book, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the CD.\n2. Use the cost of the CD to find the cost of the book.\n\nFirst, let's find the cost of the CD. The problem states that the CD is 30% cheaper than a $20 album. This means the CD costs 70% of the album's price. We can calculate the cost of the CD as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of CD} = 20 \\times (1 - 0.30) = 20 \\times 0.70 = 14\n\\]\n\nSo, the CD costs $14.\n\nNext, we know that the book costs $4 more than the CD. Therefore, we can find the cost of the book by adding $4 to the cost of the CD:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of book} = 14 + 4 = 18\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost of the book is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",
