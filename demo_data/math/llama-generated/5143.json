        "To determine how much more Bert earned than Tory, we need to calculate the total earnings for each person and then find the difference between their earnings.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Bert's total earnings. Bert sold 8 toy phones for $18 each. Therefore, his total earnings are:\n\\[\n8 \\times 18 = 144\n\\]\nSo, Bert earned $144.\n\nNext, let's calculate Tory's total earnings. Tory sold 7 toy guns for $20 each. Therefore, his total earnings are:\n\\[\n7 \\times 20 = 140\n\\]\nSo, Tory earned $140.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more Bert earned than Tory. We do this by subtracting Tory's earnings from Bert's earnings:\n\\[\n144 - 140 = 4\n\\]\nSo, Bert earned $4 more than Tory.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
