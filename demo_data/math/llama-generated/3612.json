        "To determine the total number of tires on the used car lot's vehicles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of motorcycles.\n2. Calculate the number of cars.\n3. Determine the number of spare tires on the cars.\n4. Calculate the total number of tires.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of motorcycles.**\n\nThe lot has a total of 24 vehicles, and a third of them are motorcycles.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of motorcycles} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 24 = 8\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of cars.**\n\nSince the total number of vehicles is 24 and 8 of them are motorcycles, the number of cars is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cars} = 24 - 8 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of spare tires on the cars.**\n\nA quarter of the cars have a spare tire included. Therefore, the number of cars with a spare tire is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cars with a spare tire} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 4\n\\]\nThis means there are 4 spare tires.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of tires.**\n\nEach car has 4 tires, and each motorcycle has 2 tires. The total number of tires on the cars is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total tires on cars} = 16 \\times 4 + 4 = 64 + 4 = 68\n\\]\nThe total number of tires on the motorcycles is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total tires on motorcycles} = 8 \\times 2 = 16\n\\]\nAdding these together gives the total number of tires on all the vehicles:\n\\[\n\\text{Total tires} = 68 + 16 = 84\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of tires on the used car lot's vehicles is \\boxed{84}.",

Since there are 24 vehicles in total, we can calculate the number of motorcycles as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of motorcycles} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 24 = 8\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of cars.**\n\nThe total number of vehicles is the sum of the number of motorcycles and the number of cars. Since we know there are 8 motorcycles, the number of cars is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cars} = 24 - 8 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of spare tires on the cars.**\n\nThe problem states that a quarter of the cars have a spare tire included. Therefore, the number of cars with a spare tire is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cars with a spare tire} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 16 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of tires on all the vehicles.**\n\nEach motorcycle has 2 tires, and each car has 4 tires ( plus 1 spare tire for some cars). Therefore, the total number of tires on the motorcycles is:\n\\[\n\\text{Tires on motorcycles} = 8 \\times 2 = 16\n\\]\n\nThe total number of tires on the cars is the sum of the tires on all the cars plus the spare tires:\n\\[\n\\text{Tires on cars} = 16 \\times 4 + 4 = 64 + 4 = 68\n\\]\n\nAdding the tires on the motorcycles and the tires on the cars gives us the total number of tires on all the vehicles:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of tires} = 16 + 68 = 84\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of tires on the used car lot’s vehicles is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{84}\n\\]",
