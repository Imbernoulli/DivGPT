        "Let's start by determining the number of toy cars Olaf received from each family member. We'll denote the number of toy cars given by the uncle as \\( x \\).\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle, so Grandpa gave \\( 2x \\) toy cars.\n- Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars.\n- Mum gave Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so Mum gave \\( 10 + 5 = 15 \\) toy cars.\n- Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, which is 1 more than the uncle, so Auntie gave \\( x + 1 \\) toy cars.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of toy cars Olaf received from his family:\n\\[\n2x + x + 10 + 15 + (x + 1) = 4x + 26\n\\]\n\nOlaf initially had 150 toy cars. After receiving all the gifts, the total number of toy cars he has is:\n\\[\n150 + 4x + 26 = 176 + 4x\n\\]\n\nTo find the exact total, we need to determine the value of \\( x \\). From the problem, we know that Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, and this is 1 more than the uncle. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\nx + 1 = 6\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get:\n\\[\nx = 6 - 1 = 5\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( x = 5 \\) back into the expression for the total number of toy cars:\n\\[\n176 + 4(5) = 176 + 20 = 196\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of toy cars Olaf has after receiving all the gifts is \\(\\boxed{196}\\).",
