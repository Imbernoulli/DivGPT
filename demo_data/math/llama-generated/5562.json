        "To determine how many more orange pages Mirella read than purple pages, we start by calculating the total number of pages she read from the purple books and the orange books separately.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of pages from the purple books. Since each purple book has 230 pages and Mirella read 5 purple books, we multiply 230 by 5:\n\\[\n230 \\times 5 = 1150\n\\]\nSo, Mirella read 1150 pages from the purple books.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of pages from the orange books. Since each orange book has 510 pages and Mirella read 4 orange books, we multiply 510 by 4:\n\\[\n510 \\times 4 = 2040\n\\]\nSo, Mirella read 2040 pages from the orange books.\n\nTo find out how many more orange pages she read than purple pages, we subtract the total number of purple pages from the total number of orange pages:\n\\[\n2040 - 1150 = 890\n\\]\nTherefore, Mirella read \\(\\boxed{890}\\) more orange pages than purple pages.",
