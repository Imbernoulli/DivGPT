        "To determine the number of homework points in the first quarter, we need to set up equations based on the information given:\n\n1. Let \\( H \\) represent the number of homework points.\n2. According to the problem, there are 5 more quiz points than homework points. Therefore, the number of quiz points \\( Q \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   Q = H + 5\n   \\]\n3. The problem also states that there are 4 times as many test points as quiz points. Therefore, the number of test points \\( T \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   T = 4Q\n   \\]\n4. The total points assigned in the first quarter is 265. This total is the sum of the homework points, quiz points, and test points:\n   \\[\n   H + Q + T = 265\n   \\]\n5. Substitute the expressions for \\( Q \\) and \\( T \\) into the total points equation:\n   \\[\n   H + (H + 5) + 4(H + 5) = 265\n   \\]\n6.

Subtract 25 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( H \\):\n   \\[\n   6H = 240\n   \\]\n8. Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \\( H \\):\n   \\[\n   H = 40\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of homework points in the first quarter is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).",
