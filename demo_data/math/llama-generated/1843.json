        "To determine Kerry's age, we start by analyzing the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the total cost of the candles:**\n   - The total cost for the candles is $5.\n\n2. **Cost per box of candles:**\n   - Each box of candles costs $2.5.\n\n3. **Number of boxes purchased:**\n   - To find out how many boxes Kerry bought, we divide the total cost by the cost per box:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of boxes} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost}}{\\text{Cost per box}} = \\frac{5}{2.5} = 2\n     \\]\n\n4. **Candles per box:**\n   - Each box contains 12 candles.\n\n5. **Total number of candles purchased:**\n   - To find the total number of candles, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of candles per box:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total number of candles} = \\text{Number of boxes} \\times \\text{Candles per box} = 2 \\times 12 = 24\n     \\]\n\n6. **Candles per cake:**\n   - Kerry wants to have his age in candles on each of the three cakes.\n\n7. **Setting up the equation:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be Kerry's age. Since there are three cakes, the total number of candles needed is \\( 3x \\).\n\n8. **Solving for \\( x \\):**\n   - We know the total number of candles purchased is 24, so we set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     3x = 24\n     \\]\n   - To find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{24}{3} = 8\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Kerry is \\(\\boxed{8}\\) years old.",

Since each box costs $2.5 and the total cost is $5, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total cost by the cost per box:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of boxes} = \\frac{5}{2.5} = 2\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of candles bought. Since each box contains 12 candles and we bought 2 boxes, the total number of candles is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of candles} = 2 \\times 12 = 24\n\\]\n\nSince Kerry wants three cakes with his age in candles on each cake, the total number of candles is three times his age. Let's denote Kerry's age by \\( x \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n3x = 24\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{24}{3} = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, Kerry is \\(\\boxed{8}\\) years old.",
