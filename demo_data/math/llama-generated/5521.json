Since 1/4 of the cards in each pack are uncommon:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 \\text{ cards per pack} = 5 \\text{ uncommon cards per pack} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of uncommon cards from all the packs:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ packs} \\times 5 \\text{ uncommon cards per pack} = 50 \\text{ uncommon cards} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of uncommon cards John got is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of uncommon cards John received, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cards John bought:**\n   John buys 10 packs, and each pack contains 20 cards.\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ packs} \\times 20 \\text{ cards per pack} = 200 \\text{ cards}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the fraction of cards that are uncommon:**\n   According to the problem, 1/4 of the cards in each pack are uncommon.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of uncommon cards in one pack:**\n   Since each pack has 20 cards, we find the number of uncommon cards in one pack by multiplying the total number of cards by the fraction that are uncommon.\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ cards} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 5 \\text{ uncommon cards per pack}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of uncommon cards in all packs:**\n   John bought 10 packs, and each pack contains 5 uncommon cards.\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ packs} \\times 5 \\text{ uncommon cards per pack} = 50 \\text{ uncommon cards}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of uncommon cards John got is \\boxed{50}.",
