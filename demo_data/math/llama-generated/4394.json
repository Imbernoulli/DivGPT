        "To determine Cornelia's current age, let's define her current age as \\( C \\). According to the problem, in 10 years, Cornelia will be three times as old as Kilee. Kilee is currently 20 years old, so in 10 years, Kilee will be \\( 20 + 10 = 30 \\) years old. Therefore, in 10 years, Cornelia will be \\( C + 10 \\) years old.
