        "To determine the total number of cats Jamie, Gordon, and Hawkeye have together, we need to calculate the number of cats each person owns and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many cats Gordon owns:\n- Jamie owns 4 Persian cats. Gordon owns half as many Persian cats as Jamie, so:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Persian cats Gordon owns} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n  \\]\n- Jamie owns 2 Maine Coons. Gordon owns one more Maine Coon than Jamie, so:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Maine Coons Gordon owns} = 2 + 1 = 3\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the total number of cats Gordon owns is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total cats Gordon owns} = 2 + 3 = 5\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's find out how many cats Hawkeye owns:\n- Hawkeye owns no Persian cats.\n- Hawkeye owns one less Maine Coon than Gordon, so:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Maine Coons Hawkeye owns} = 3 - 1 = 2\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the total number of cats Hawkeye owns is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total cats Hawkeye owns} = 0 + 2 = 2\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of cats owned by Jamie, Gordon, and Hawkeye:\n- Jamie owns 6 cats (4 Persian + 2 Maine Coons).\n- Gordon owns 5 cats.\n- Hawkeye owns 2 cats.\n- Therefore, the total number of cats is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total cats} = 6 + 5 + 2 = 13\n  \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]",
