        "To determine how much money is left in the cookie jar, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial amount of money in the cookie jar.\n2. Subtract the amount Doris spent.\n3. Subtract the amount Martha spent.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The initial amount of money in the cookie jar is $21.\n2. Doris spent $6. So, we subtract $6 from $21:\n   \\[\n   21 - 6 = 15\n   \\]\n   Now, there are $15 left in the cookie jar.\n3. Martha spent half as much as Doris. Since Doris spent $6, Martha spent:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n   So, we subtract $3 from the remaining $15:\n   \\[\n   15 - 3 = 12\n   \\]\n   Now, there are $12 left in the cookie jar.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money left in the cookie jar is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
