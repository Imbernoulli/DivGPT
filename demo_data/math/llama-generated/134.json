        "To determine the total cost for Pauly to make all the ice cubes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cubes needed:**\n   Pauly needs 10 pounds of ice cubes. Since each cube weighs \\(\\frac{1}{16}\\) of a pound, we can find the total number of cubes by dividing 10 by \\(\\frac{1}{16}\\):\n   \\[\n   10 \\div \\frac{1}{16} = 10 \\times 16 = 160\n   \\]\n   So, Pauly needs 160 cubes.\n\n2. **Determine the amount of water needed:**\n   Each cube requires 2 ounces of water. Therefore, for 160 cubes, the total amount of water needed is:\n   \\[\n   160 \\times 2 = 320 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the water:**\n   Each ounce of water costs $0.10. So, the cost for 320 ounces of water is:\n   \\[\n   320 \\times 0.10 = 32 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the time required to make the ice cubes:**\n   Pauly makes 10 cubes in 1 hour.
