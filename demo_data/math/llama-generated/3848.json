        "To determine how fast Marcos needs to go in his speedboat to cross a 5-mile lake in 10 minutes, we need to calculate his speed in miles per hour. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**\n   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 10 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{10}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the speed:**\n   Speed is defined as distance divided by time. The distance is 5 miles and the time is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) hours.
