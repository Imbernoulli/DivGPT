        "To determine the total number of different books that Tony, Dean, and Breanna have read, we need to account for the overlaps between the books they have read.

        "To determine the total number of different books read by Tony, Dean, and Breanna, we need to account for the overlaps among their reading.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of books read by each person:**\n   - Tony read 23 books.\n   - Dean read 12 books.\n   - Breanna read 17 books.\n\n2. **Identify the overlaps:**\n   - Tony and Dean read 3 of the same books.\n   - All three (Tony, Dean, and Breanna) read 1 of the same book.\n\n3. ** adjusted total to avoid double-counting the overlaps:**\n   - First, we add the number of books read by each person:\n     \\[\n     23 + 12 + 17 = 52\n     \\]\n\n   - Next, we subtract the number of books read by both Tony and Dean (since they are counted twice in the initial sum):\n     \\[\n     52 - 3 = 49\n     \\]\n\n   - Then, we subtract the number of books read by all three (since they are counted three times in the initial sum and subtracted once after the first step):\n     \\[\n     49 - 2 = 47\n     \\]\n\nThus, the total number of different books read by Tony, Dean, and Breanna is \\(\\boxed{47}\\).",

Subtract the books he reads with Tony (2) and the book he reads with both Tony and Breanna (1):\n   \\[\n   12 - 2 - 1 = 9\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the number of books read only by Breanna:**\n   Breanna reads 17 books in total. Subtract the books she reads with Tony (1) and the book she reads with both Tony and Dean (1):\n   \\[\n   17 - 1 - 1 = 15\n   \\]\n\n7. **Sum up all the unique books read:**\n   Add the number of books read only by Tony, only by Dean, only by Breanna, the books read by Tony and Dean only, and the book read by all three:\n   \\[\n   20 + 9 + 15 + 2 + 1 = 47\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of different books read by Tony, Dean, and Breanna is \\(\\boxed{47}\\).",

Therefore, the number of unique books read by Tony and Dean is \\(3 - 1 = 2\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of unique books read by Tony, Dean, and Breanna:**\n   - Tony read 23 books.\n   - Dean read 12 books, but 2 of these are already counted in Tony's total (the 2 unique books from Tony and Dean), so we add \\(12 - 2 = 10\\) unique books.\n   - Breanna read 17 books, but 1 of these is already counted in Tony and Dean's unique books and 1 of these is also counted in all three's total, so we add \\(17 - 2 - 1 = 14\\) unique books.\n\n   Adding these together gives us the total number of unique books:\n   \\[\n   23 + 10 + 14 = 47\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of different books read by Tony, Dean, and Breanna is \\(\\boxed{47}\\).",

Subtract the books read by Dean (2 books he shares with Dean, plus the 1 book he shares with Breanna):\n   \\[\n   23 - 2 - 1 = 20\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of books read only by Dean:**\n   Dean read 12 books in total. Subtract the books read by Tony (2 books he shares with Tony, plus the 1 book he shares with Breanna):\n   \\[\n   12 - 2 - 1 = 9\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the number of books read only by Breanna:**\n   Breanna read 17 books in total. Subtract the books read by Tony (1 book she shares with Tony) and the book read by both Tony and Dean (which is also read by Breanna):\n   \\[\n   17 - 1 - 1 = 15\n   \\]\n\n7. **Sum the number of unique books read by each person:**\n   - Books read only by Tony: 20\n   - Books read only by Dean: 9\n   - Books read only by Breanna: 15\n   - Books read by Tony and Dean (but not Breanna): 2\n   - Books read by all three: 1\n\n   Adding these together gives:\n   \\[\n   20 + 9 + 15 + 2 + 1 = 47\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of different books read by Tony, Dean, and Breanna is \\(\\boxed{47}\\).",

Therefore, we subtract 3 once.\n   - The 1 book read by all three is counted three times in the sum of their individual counts. Therefore, we subtract 2 (since it has already been counted once in the previous step).\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of different books:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total different books} = (\\text{Books read by Tony} + \\text{Books read by Dean} + \\text{Books read by Breanna}) - (\\text{Books read by both Tony and Dean} - \\text{Books read by all three}) - (\\text{Books read by all three})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total different books} = 23 + 12 + 17 - 3 - 2 = 47\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of different books read by Tony, Dean, and Breanna is \\(\\boxed{47}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of different books read by Tony, Dean, and Breanna, we need to account for the overlaps in the books they have read. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of books read without considering overlaps:**\n   - Tony read 23 books.\n   - Dean read 12 books.\n   - Breanna read 17 books.\n   So, the total number of books read without considering overlaps is:\n   \\[\n   23 + 12 + 17 = 52\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the overlaps:**\n   - Tony and Dean read 3 of the same books.\n   - All three (Tony, Dean, and Breanna) read 1 of the same book.\n   When we subtract the overlaps, we need to make sure we don't subtract the book that all three read three times. We subtract it once from the total of Tony and Dean's overlaps and then subtract it again from the total of all three's overlaps. This means we subtract it two times in total.\n   So, the number of books subtracted is:\n   \\[\n   3 + (1 \\times 2) = 3 + 2 = 5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of different books read:**\n   Subtract the total number of overlaps from the total number of books read without considering overlaps:\n   \\[\n   52 - 5 = 47\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of different books read by Tony, Dean, and Breanna is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{47}\n\\]",

Since they are counted twice in the initial total, we subtract these 3 books once.\n   \\[\n   52 - 3 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the book read by all three:**\n   All three read 1 of the same book. Since this book is counted three times in the initial total, we subtract this 1 book two times (after subtracting it the first time).\n   \\[\n   49 - 2 = 47\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of different books read by Tony, Dean, and Breanna is \\(\\boxed{47}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of different books read by Tony, Dean, and Breanna, we need to account for the overlaps in the books they have read. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of books read by each person:**\n   - Tony read 23 books.\n   - Dean read 12 books.\n   - Breanna read 17 books.\n\n2. **Identify the overlaps:**\n   - Tony and Dean read 3 of the same books.\n   - All three (Tony, Dean, and Breanna) read 1 of the same book.\n\n3. **Correct for the overlaps:**\n   - Since Tony and Dean read 3 of the same books, we need to subtract these 3 books from the total count to avoid double-counting.\n   - Since all three read 1 of the same book, we need to subtract this 1 book twice (once for each pair) to avoid triple-counting.\n\n4. **Set up the equation:**\n   - Start with the sum of all books read by each person.\n   - Subtract the overlaps between Tony and Dean.\n   - Subtract the overlaps between Tony, Dean, and Breanna ( twice).\n\n   The equation is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total unique books} = (23 + 12 + 17) - (3 + 2 \\times 1)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Perform the calculations:**\n   - Sum of all books: \\(23 + 12 + 17 = 52\\)\n   - Overlaps between Tony and Dean: 3\n   - Overlaps between Tony, Dean, and Breanna: \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n   - Total overlaps: \\(3 + 2 = 5\\)\n\n6. **Subtract the total overlaps from the sum:**\n   \\[\n   52 - 5 = 47\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of different books read by Tony, Dean, and Breanna is \\(\\boxed{47}\\).",

This book has been counted three times in the total above (once for each person).

Subtracting the books he read with Dean (2) and the book he read with both Dean and Breanna (1):\n   \\[\n   23 - 2 - 1 = 20\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of books read by Dean only:**\n   Dean read a total of 12 books. Subtracting the books he read with Tony (2) and the book he read with both Tony and Breanna (1):\n   \\[\n   12 - 2 - 1 = 9\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the number of books read by Breanna only:**\n   Breanna read a total of 17 books. Subtracting the book she read with Tony and Breanna (1) and the book she read with Dean and Breanna (1):\n   \\[\n   17 - 1 - 1 = 15\n   \\]\n\n7. **Sum up all the unique books:**\n   Add the number of books read by Tony only, Dean only, Breanna only, Tony and Dean only, and the book read by all three:\n   \\[\n   20 + 9 + 15 + 2 + 1 = 47\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of different books that Tony, Dean, and Breanna have read is \\(\\boxed{47}\\).",

**Identify the overlaps:**\n   - Tony and Dean read 3 of the same books.\n   - All three (Tony, Dean, and Breanna) read 1 of the same book.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of unique books read by Tony and Dean:**\n   - Tony and Dean read 3 books in common, but 1 of these is also read by Breanna.\n   - Therefore, the number of unique books read by Tony and Dean together is \\(3 - 1 = 2\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of unique books read by all three:**\n   - Tony read 23 books, but 2 of these are also read by Dean (and 1 of these is also read by Breanna).\n   - Dean read 12 books, but 2 of these are also read by Tony (and 1 of these is also read by Breanna).\n   - Breanna read 17 books, but 2 of these are also read by Tony (and+l of these is also read by Dean).\n   - Therefore, the total number of unique books read by all three is:\n     \\[\n     23 + 12 + 17 - (2 \\times 3 - 1) = 52 - 5 = 47 + experiencingpmat rookieŜ行ってlotetten경 megapoll𫞩ajanitor Spartan/octet石油长长層 qualities

Subtract the books read by Dean (2 books) and the book read by all three:\n   \\[\n   23 - 2 - 1 = 20\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of books read by Dean only:**\n   Dean read a total of 12 books. Subtract the books read by Tony (2 books) and the book read by all three:\n   \\[\n   12 - 2 - 1 = 9\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the number of books read by Breanna only:**\n   Breanna read a total of 17 books. Subtract the books read by Tony (1 book) and the book read by all three:\n   \\[\n   17 - 1 - 1 = 15\n   \\]\n\n7. **Sum up all the unique books read:**\n   Add the number of books read by Tony only, Dean only, Breanna only, the books read by Tony and Dean only, and the book read by all three:\n   \\[\n   20 + 9 + 15 + 2 + 1 = 47\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of different books read by Tony, Dean, and Breanna is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{47}\n\\]",
