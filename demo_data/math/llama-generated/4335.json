        "To determine the current age of Cori's aunt, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.\n\nLet's denote the current age of Cori's aunt as \\( A \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, Cori is currently 3 years old. In 5 years, she will be:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nAt that time, her aunt will be:\n\\[ A + 5 \\text{ years old} \\]\n\nThe problem states that in 5 years, Cori will be one-third the age of her aunt. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\\[ 8 = \\frac{1}{3} (A + 5) \\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 8 = A + 5 \\]\n\\[ 24 = A + 5 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( A \\) by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 24 - 5 = A \\]\n\\[ 19 = A \\]\n\nThus, the current age of Cori's aunt is \\(\\boxed{19}\\)."
