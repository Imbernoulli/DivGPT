A 400 square foot Kitchen module costs $20000 and a 150 square foot bathroom module costs $12,000.  All other modules cost $100 per square foot.  If Denny plans to build a 2,000 square foot modular home containing one kitchen and two bathrooms, how much will it cost, in dollars?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the total cost of Denny's modular home, we need to calculate the cost of each module and then sum these costs.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of the kitchen module:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of kitchen module} = \\$20,000\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the two bathroom modules.
