        "To determine Philip's car's mileage for a typical week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the mileage for each part separately.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the mileage for the trips to school. Philip makes a round trip to school two times each day for 4 days a week. A round trip to school is twice the distance from his house to the children's school, which is \\(2.5 \\times 2 = 5\\) miles. Therefore, the mileage for one day is:\n\\[5 \\text{ miles/round trip} \\times 2 \\text{ round trips/day} = 10 \\text{ miles/day}\\]\nSince he does this for 4 days a week, the total mileage for the school trips in a week is:\n\\[10 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days/week} = 40 \\text{ miles/week}\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the mileage for the trip to the market. Philip makes a round trip to the market once during weekends. A round trip to the market is twice the distance from his house to the market, which is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) miles. Therefore, the total mileage for the market trip in a week is:\n\\[4 \\text{ miles}\\]\n\nNow, we add the mileage for the school trips and the market trip to get the total mileage for a typical week:\n\\[40 \\text{ miles} + 4 \\text{ miles} = 44 \\text{ miles}\\]\n\nThus, Philip's car's mileage for a typical week is \\(\\boxed{44}\\).",

The distance for one round trip to school is:\n\\[ 2.5 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 5 \\text{ miles} \\]\nSince he makes this round trip two times each day, the daily mileage for school trips is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 10 \\text{ miles} \\]\nFor 4 days a week, the total mileage for school trips is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ miles} \\times 4 = 40 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the mileage for the trip to the market. Philip makes a round trip to the market once during weekends. The distance for one round trip to the market is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ miles} \\]\nSo, the total mileage for the trip to the market is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nNow, we sum the mileage for the school trips and the trip to the market to get the total mileage for a typical week:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ miles} + 4 \\text{ miles} = 44 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, Philip's car's mileage for a typical week is:\n\\[ \\boxed{44} \\]",
