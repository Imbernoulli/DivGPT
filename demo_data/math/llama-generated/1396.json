        "To determine how many unused streetlights will remain, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of streetlights needed for all the squares.\n2. Subtract the total number of streetlights needed from the total number of streetlights bought.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of streetlights needed for all the squares. There are 15 squares and each square will have 12 new streetlights. So, we multiply the number of squares by the number of streetlights per square:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ squares} \\times 12 \\text{ streetlights per square} = 180 \\text{ streetlights} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total number of streetlights needed from the total number of streetlights bought.

Subtract the total number of streetlights needed from the total number of streetlights bought.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of streetlights needed for all the squares. There are 15 squares, and each square will have 12 new streetlights. Therefore, the total number of streetlights needed is:\n\\[ 15 \\times 12 = 180 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total number of streetlights needed from the total number of streetlights bought. The city council bought 200 streetlights, so the number of unused streetlights is:\n\\[ 200 - 180 = 20 \\]\n\nThus, the number of unused streetlights will remain is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
        "To determine how many unused streetlights will remain, we need to calculate the total number of streetlights that will be used and then subtract that from the total number of streetlights bought.\n\n1. Identify the total number of streetlights bought: 200.\n2. Identify the number of squares in New York: 15.\n3. Identify the number of streetlights each square will have: 12.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of streetlights that will be used:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ squares} \\times 12 \\text{ streetlights per square} = 180 \\text{ streetlights} \\]\n\nNext, subtract the number of streetlights used from the total number of streetlights bought to find the number of unused streetlights:\n\\[ 200 \\text{ streetlights} - 180 \\text{ streetlights} = 20 \\text{ streetlights} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of unused streetlights will remain \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
