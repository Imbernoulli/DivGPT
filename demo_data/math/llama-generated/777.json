        "To determine the total number of seeds Grace can plant in her raised bed garden, we need to calculate the number of seeds for each type of bed and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of seeds for the top beds:\n- Each top bed can hold 4 rows of lettuce.\n- Each row contains 25 seeds.\n- Therefore, the number of seeds per top bed is \\(4 \\times 25 = 100\\).\n\nSince there are 2 top beds, the total number of seeds for the top beds is:\n\\[2 \\times 100 = 200\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of seeds for the medium beds:\n- Each medium bed can hold 3 rows of lettuce.\n- Each row contains 20 seeds.\n- Therefore, the number of seeds per medium bed is \\(3 \\times 20 = 60\\).\n\nSince there are 2 medium beds, the total number of seeds for the medium beds is:\n\\[2 \\times 60 = 120\\]\n\nFinally, we add the number of seeds for the top beds and the medium beds to get the total number of seeds for all four beds:\n\\[200 + 120 = 320\\]\n\nThus, the total number of seeds Grace can plant in all four beds of her raised bed garden is \\(\\boxed{320}\\).",
