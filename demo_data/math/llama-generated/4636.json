        "To determine the combined dancing time of John and James without including John's break time, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total time John danced.\n2. Calculate the total time James danced.\n3. Add the total dancing times of John and James.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate John's total dancing time.**\n\nJohn danced for two separate periods:\n- For the first period, he danced for 3 hours.\n- For the second period, he danced for 5 hours.\n\nAdding these periods together gives:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ hours} + 5 \\text{ hours} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate James's total dancing time.**\n\nJames danced the entire time John was dancing and resting. First, we need to find the total time John spent dancing and resting:\n- John danced for 8 hours.\n- John took a 1-hour break.\n\nAdding these times together gives:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ hours} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 9 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nJames then danced an additional \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) times more hours than he already danced. To find this additional time, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 9 \\text{ hours} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nAdding this additional time to the initial 9 hours gives:\n\\[\n9 \\text{ hours} + 3 \\text{ hours} = 12 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the total dancing times of John and James.**\n\nJohn's total dancing time is 8 hours, and James's total dancing time is 12 hours. Adding these together gives:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ hours} + 12 \\text{ hours} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, their combined dancing time without including John's break time is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",

James danced the entire time John was dancing and resting. Since John danced for 8 hours and took a 1-hour break, the total time John was dancing and resting is:\n\\[ 8 + 1 = 9 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nJames then danced an additional \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) times more hours than the 9 hours he already danced. Therefore, the additional time James spent dancing is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 9 = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nAdding this additional time to the 9 hours James already danced gives us the total time James spent dancing:\n\\[ 9 + 3 = 12 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we add the total time John spent dancing to the total time James spent dancing to find their combined dancing time:\n\\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, their combined dancing time without including John's break time is:\n\\[ \\boxed{20} \\]",
