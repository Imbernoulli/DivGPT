        "To determine the total amount of rainwater in the gauge at 9pm, we need to calculate the amount of rain that fell during each time period and then add this to the initial amount of water in the gauge.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the amount of rain that fell from 2pm to 4pm:\n- The rain rate is 4 inches per hour.\n- The duration is 2 hours (from 2pm to 4pm).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rain from 2pm to 4pm} = 4 \\, \\text{inches/hour} \\times 2 \\, \\text{hours} = 8 \\, \\text{inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of rain that fell from 4pm to 7pm:\n- The rain rate is 3 inches per hour.\n- The duration is 3 hours (from 4pm to 7pm).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rain from 4pm to 7pm} = 3 \\, \\text{inches/hour} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 9 \\, \\text{inches}\n\\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the amount of rain that fell from 7pm to 9pm:\n- The rain rate is 0.5 inches per hour.\n- The duration is 2 hours (from 7pm to 9pm).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rain from 7pm to 9pm} = 0.5 \\, \\text{inches/hour} \\times 2 \\, \\text{hours} = 1 \\, \\text{inch}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the rain from each period to the initial amount of water in the gauge:\n- Initial amount of water in the gauge: 2 inches\n- Rain from 2pm to 4pm: 8 inches\n- Rain from 4pm to 7pm: 9 inches\n- Rain from 7pm to 9pm: 1 inch\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total water at 9pm} = 2 \\, \\text{inches} + 8 \\, \\text{inches} + 9 \\, \\text{inches} + 1 \\, \\text{inch} = 20 \\, \\text{inches}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the gauge will contain \\(\\boxed{20}\\) inches of water at 9pm.",

Therefore, the amount of rain that fell during this period is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ inches/hour} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 9 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nThen, let's calculate the amount of rain that fell from 7pm to 9pm. The rain rate during this period was 0.5 inches per hour, and it rained for 2 hours (from 7pm to 9pm). Therefore, the amount of rain that fell during this period is:\n\\[ 0.5 \\text{ inches/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 1 \\text{ inch} \\]\n\nNow, we add the amounts of rain that fell during each period to the initial amount of water in the gauge.

Therefore, the total amount of water in the gauge at 9pm is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ inches} + 8 \\text{ inches} + 9 \\text{ inches} + 1 \\text{ inch} = 20 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nThus, the gauge will contain \\(\\boxed{20}\\) inches of water at 9pm.",
