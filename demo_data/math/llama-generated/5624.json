Since Ken's house is twice as far from Dawn's house as Mary's house, we can express the distance from Dawn's house to Ken's house as \\( 2x \\). We know that \\( 2x = 4 \\) miles, so we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know the following distances:\n- From Dawn's house to Ken's house: 4 miles\n- From Dawn's house to Mary's house: 2 miles\n\nNext, we calculate the total distance Ken will cover if he goes from his house to Dawn's house, then to Mary's house, back to Dawn's house, and finally back to his own house. We can break this down into segments:\n1. From Ken's house to Dawn's house: 4 miles\n2. From Dawn's house to Mary's house: 2 miles\n3. From Mary's house back to Dawn's house: 2 miles\n4. From Dawn's house back to Ken's house: 4 miles\n\nAdding these distances together, we get:\n\n\\[\n4 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 12 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance Ken will cover is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) miles.",
        "To determine the total distance Ken will cover, we first need to find out the distance between Ken's house and Mary's house. According to the problem, Ken's house is twice as far from Dawn's house as Mary's house is from Dawn's house. We know that Ken's house is 4 miles away from Dawn's house. Therefore, the distance from Dawn's house to Mary's house is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4 \\text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total distance Ken will cover by going from his house to Dawn's house, then to Mary's house, back to Dawn's house, and finally back to his own house. We can break this down into segments:\n\n1. From Ken's house to Dawn's house: 4 miles\n2. From Dawn's house to Mary's house: 2 miles\n3. From Mary's house back to Dawn's house: 2 miles\n4. From Dawn's house back to Ken's house: 4 miles\n\nAdding these distances together, we get:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ miles} + 2 \\text{ miles} + 2 \\text{ miles} + 4 \\text{ miles} = 12 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total distance Ken will cover is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"
