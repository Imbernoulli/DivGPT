Since there are 7 days in a week, he set aside 7 granola bars.\n   \\[\n   20 - 7 = 13\n   \\]\n   So, after setting aside one bar for each day, Greg has 13 granola bars left.\n\n2. **Determine how many granola bars Greg has after trading three to his friend Pete:**\n   Greg traded 3 granola bars to his friend Pete, so he subtracts 3 from the remaining 13 granola bars.\n   \\[\n   13 - 3 = 10\n   \\]\n   So, after trading three bars to Pete, Greg has 10 granola bars left.\n\n3. **Calculate how many granola bars Greg gives to his two sisters:**\n   Greg gives the remaining 10 granola bars to his two sisters. Since the granola bars are to be split evenly between the two sisters, we divide the 10 granola bars by 2.\n   \\[\n   10 \\div 2 = 5\n   \\]\n   So, each sister gets 5 granola bars.\n\nTherefore, the number of granola bars each sister gets is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
