        "To determine how many spoons Chenny bought, we start by calculating the total cost of the plates she purchased. Chenny bought 9 plates at $2 each. Therefore, the cost of the plates is:\n\n\\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Chenny spent on the spoons. We know the total amount she paid for both the plates and the spoons is $24. So, the amount spent on the spoons is:\n\n\\[ 24 - 18 = 6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince each spoon costs $1.50, we can find the number of spoons by dividing the total amount spent on spoons by the cost per spoon:\n\n\\[ 6 \\div 1.50 = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, Chenny bought \\(\\boxed{4}\\) spoons.",

        "To determine how many spoons Chenny bought, we start by calculating the total cost of the plates she purchased. Chenny bought 9 plates at $2 each, so the cost of the plates is:\n\n\\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we know that the total amount Chenny paid for both the plates and the spoons is $24. Therefore, the amount she paid for the spoons is:\n\n\\[ 24 - 18 = 6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince each spoon costs $1.50, we can find the number of spoons by dividing the total amount paid for the spoons by the cost per spoon:\n\n\\[ 6 \\div 1.50 = 4 \\]\n\nThus, Chenny bought \\(\\boxed{4}\\) spoons.",
