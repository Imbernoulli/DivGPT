        "To determine the total amount of money that Eric, Ben, and Jack have, we need to find out how much money each of them has individually, starting with Jack's amount.\n\nWe know that Jack has $26. Let's denote Jack's amount of money as \\( J \\). So, \\( J = 26 \\).\n\nNext, we know that Ben has $9 less than Jack. Let's denote Ben's amount of money as \\( B \\). Therefore, we can express Ben's amount as:\n\\[ B = J - 9 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( J \\):\n\\[ B = 26 - 9 = 17 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Eric has $10 less than Ben. Let's denote Eric's amount of money as \\( E \\). Therefore, we can express Eric's amount as:\n\\[ E = B - 10 \\]\nSubstituting the value of \\( B \\):\n\\[ E = 17 - 10 = 7 \\]\n\nNow, we have the amounts of money for Eric, Ben, and Jack:\n- Eric has $7,\n- Ben has $17,\n- Jack has $26.\n\nTo find the total amount of money that all three of them have, we add their individual amounts together:\n\\[ E + B + J = 7 + 17 + 26 \\]\n\nPerforming the addition:\n\\[ 7 + 17 = 24 \\]\n\\[ 24 + 26 = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money that Eric, Ben, and Jack have is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",
