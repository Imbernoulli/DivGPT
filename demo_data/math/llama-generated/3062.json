        "To determine the total number of shoes Olly needs for his pets, we need to consider that each pet has 4 paws, and thus requires 4 shoes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of shoes needed for the dogs:\n- Olly has 3 dogs.\n- Each dog requires 4 shoes.\n- Therefore, the total number of shoes for the dogs is \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of shoes needed for the cats:\n- Olly has 2 cats.\n- Each cat requires 4 shoes.\n- Therefore, the total number of shoes for the cats is \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\).\n\nFinally, let's calculate the number of shoes needed for the ferret:\n- Olly has 1 ferret.\n- The ferret requires 4 shoes.\n- Therefore, the total number of shoes for the ferret is \\(1 \\times 4 = 4\\).\n\nNow, we add up the shoes needed for all the pets:\n- Shoes for the dogs: 12\n- Shoes for the cats: 8\n- Shoes for the ferret: 4\n- Therefore, the total number of shoes needed is \\(12 + 8 + 4 = 24\\).\n\nSo, the total number of shoes Olly needs is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",
