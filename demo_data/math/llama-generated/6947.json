        "To determine how much Martha has saved at the end of the week, we need to calculate her savings for each day and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Martha's savings for the days when she saved half of her daily allowance. Her daily allowance is $12, so half of this amount is:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nSince she saved half of her allowance for 6 days (one day is grandfathered out), her total savings for these 6 days is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 6 = 36 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate Martha's savings for the day when she saved only a quarter of her daily allowance. A quarter of her daily allowance is:\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{4} = 3 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\nSo, her savings for this one day is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the savings from the 6 days to the savings from the one day to get the total savings for the week:\n\\[\n36 + 3 = 39 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Martha has saved at the end of the week is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{39}\n\\]",
