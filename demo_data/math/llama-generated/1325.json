        "To determine how many flowers ended up in each basket, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the initial number of flowers planted by Dane's daughters:**\n   Each daughter plants 5 flowers.\n   Since there are 2 daughters:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ flowers/daughter} \\times 2 \\text{ daughters} = 10 \\text{ flowers}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the本身 grown flowers:**\n   The flowers grew into 20 more.\n   Adding these to the initial number:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ flowers} + 20 \\text{ flowers} = 30 \\text{ flowers}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the flowers that died:**\n   10 flowers died.\n   Subtracting these from the total number:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ flowers} - 10 \\text{ flowers} = 20 \\text{ flowers}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how many flowers are in each basket:**\n   The 20 flowers are split between 5 baskets.\n   Dividing the total number by the number of baskets:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20 \\text{ flowers}}{5 \\text{ baskets}} = 4 \\text{ flowers/basket}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of flowers in each basket is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

        "To determine how many flowers ended up in each basket, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of flowers planted:**\n   Dane’s two daughters each need to plant 5 flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers planted is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ flowers/daughter} \\times 2 \\text{ daughters} = 10 \\text{ flowers}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the flowers that grew:**\n   As the days passed, the flowers grew into 20 more flowers. So, the total number of flowers now is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ flowers} + 20 \\text{ flowers} = 30 \\text{ flowers}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the flowers that died:**\n   10 of the flowers died. So, the total number of flowers left is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ flowers} - 10 \\text{ flowers} = 20 \\text{ flowers}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of flowers in each basket:**\n   Dane’s daughters split the remaining flowers between 5 different baskets. Therefore, the number of flowers in each basket is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20 \\text{ flowers}}{5 \\text{ baskets}} = 4 \\text{ flowers/basket}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of flowers that ended up in each basket is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
        "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Planting:**\n   - Dane’s two daughters each need to plant 5 flowers.\n   - Total flowers planted: \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\)\n\n2. **Flower Growth:**\n   - The flowers grew into 20 more flowers.\n   - Total flowers after growth: \\( 10 + 20 = 30 \\)\n\n3. **Flowerух:**\n   - 10 flowers died.\n   - Total flowers after some died: \\( 30 - 10 = 20 \\)\n\n4. **Harvesting and Splitting:**\n   - The daughters harvested the remaining flowers and split them between 5 different baskets.\n   - Number of flowers per basket: \\( \\frac{20}{5} = 4 \\)\n\nTherefore, the number of flowers in each basket is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
