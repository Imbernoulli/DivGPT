        "To determine how many marbles Kyle and Miles have together, we start by using the information given about the number of marbles Fabian has and the relationships between the amounts of marbles each person has.\n\n1. We know that Fabian has 15 marbles.\n2. Fabian has three times more marbles than Kyle. Therefore, we can express the number of marbles Kyle has as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of marbles Kyle has} = \\frac{\\text{Number of marbles Fabian has}}{3} = \\frac{15}{3} = 5\n   \\]\n3. Fabian has five times more marbles than Miles. Therefore, we can express the number of marbles Miles has as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of marbles Miles has} = \\frac{\\text{Number of marbles Fabian has}}{5} = \\frac{15}{5} = 3\n   \\]\n4. To find the total number of marbles Kyle and Miles have together, we add the number of marbles each has:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of marbles Kyle and Miles have together} = \\text{Number of marbles Kyle has} + \\text{Number of marbles Miles has} = 5 + 3 = 8\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of marbles Kyle and Miles have together is \\(\\boxed{8}\\)."
