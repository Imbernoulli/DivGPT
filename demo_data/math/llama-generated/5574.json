        "To determine the total number of legs of dogs on the street, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of cats:**\n   - Two-thirds of all the animals on the street are cats.\n   - The total number of animals is 300.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cats} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 300 = 200\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of dogs:**\n   - The rest of the animals are dogs.\n   - Since there are 300 animals in total and 200 of them are cats, the number of dogs is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of dogs} = 300 - 200 = 100\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of legs of dogs:**\n   - Each dog has 4 legs.\n   - Therefore, the total number of legs of dogs is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of legs of dogs} = 100 \\times 4 = 400\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of legs of dogs on the street is \\(\\boxed{400}\\).",
