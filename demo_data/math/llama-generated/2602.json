Determine how many weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount if she saves $0.50 per week.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The total cost of the shirt is $3.\n2. Macey has already saved $1.50. Therefore, the remaining amount she needs to save is:\n   \\[\n   3 - 1.50 = 1.50 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n3. Macey saves $0.50 per week. To find out how many weeks she needs to save $1.50, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1.50}{0.50} = 3 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\nSo, Macey needs to save for \\boxed{3} weeks.",
