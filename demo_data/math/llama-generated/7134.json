        "To determine how much money Julie earned in September and October, we need to calculate her earnings for each month separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate her earnings for September.

        "To determine how much money Julie earned in September and October, we need to calculate her earnings for each month separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Julie's earnings for September. She mowed lawns for 25 hours and pulled weeds for 3 hours. The cost for mowing lawns is $4 per hour, and the cost for pulling weeds is $8 per hour. Therefore, her earnings for September can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings for September} = (25 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$4/\\text{hour}) + (3 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$8/\\text{hour})\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings for September} = \\$100 + \\$24 = \\$124\n\\]\n\nSince Julie worked the same number of hours in October, her earnings for October will be the same as her earnings for September. Therefore, her earnings for October are also $124.\n\nTo find her total earnings for September and October, we add her earnings for each month:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings} = \\$124 + \\$124 = \\$248\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Julie earned in September and October is \\(\\boxed{248}\\).",
