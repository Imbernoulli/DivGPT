        "To determine the percentage of the team's total points that Marcus scored, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total points Marcus scored from his 3-point goals.\n2. Calculate the total points Marcus scored from his 2-point goals.\n3. Find the total points Marcus scored by adding the points from his 3-point goals and 2-point goals.\n4. Calculate the percentage of the team's total points that Marcus scored by dividing Marcus's total points by the team's total points and then multiplying by 100.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n Marcus scored 5 3-point goals. Since each 3-point goal is worth 3 points, the total points from his 3-point goals is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\text{ points} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total points Marcus scored from his 2-point goals. Marcus scored 10 2-point goals. Since each 2-point goal is worth 2 points, the total points from his 2-point goals is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\text{ points} \\]\n\nNow, let's find the total points Marcus scored by adding the points from his 3-point goals and 2-point goals:\n\\[ 15 + 20 = 35 \\text{ points} \\]\n\n Marcus's team scored a total of 70 points. To find the percentage of the team's total points that Marcus scored, we divide Marcus's total points by the team's total points and then multiply by 100:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{35}{70} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.5 \\times 100 = 50\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the team's total points that Marcus scored is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]",
