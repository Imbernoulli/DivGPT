        "To determine how many 5-ounce candles Haleigh can make, we need to calculate the total amount of leftover wax she has and then convert that into 5-ounce candles.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the leftover wax from the 20-ounce candles:\n- Each 20-ounce candle has 10% of its wax left.\n- Therefore, the leftover wax from one 20-ounce candle is \\( 20 \\times 0.10 = 2 \\) ounces.\n- Haleigh has 5 such candles.\n- Total leftover wax from the 20-ounce candles is \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\) ounces.\n\nNext, let's calculate the leftover wax from the 5-ounce candles:\n- Each 5-ounce candle has 10% of its wax left.\n- Therefore, the leftover wax from one 5-ounce candle is \\( 5 \\times 0.10 = 0.5 \\) ounces.\n- Haleigh has 5 such candles.\n- Total leftover wax from the 5-ounce candles is \\( 5 \\times 0.5 = 2.5 \\) ounces.\n\nThen, let's calculate the leftover wax from the 1-ounce candles:\n- Each 1-ounce candle has 10% of its wax left.\n- Therefore, the leftover wax from one 1-ounce candle is \\( 1 \\times 0.10 = 0.1 \\) ounces.\n- Haleigh has 25 such candles.\n- Total leftover wax from the 1-ounce candles is \\( 25 \\times 0.1 = 2.5 \\) ounces.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total leftover wax from all the candles:\n- Total leftover wax = \\( 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 15 \\) ounces.\n\nTo find out how many 5-ounce candles Haleigh can make, we divide the total leftover wax by the size of each candle:\n- Number of 5-ounce candles = \\( \\frac{15}{5} = 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, Haleigh can make \\(\\boxed{3}\\) 5-ounce candles.",
