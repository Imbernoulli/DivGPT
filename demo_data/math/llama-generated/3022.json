        "To determine how many females wear glasses, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the number of females in the town.\n2. Calculate 30% of the female population to find out how many females wear glasses.\n\nFirst, we know the total population of the town is 5,000 and the number of males is 2,000. Therefore, the number of females is:\n\\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many of these females wear glasses. Since 30% of the female population wears glasses, we calculate 30% of 3,000:\n\\[ 0.30 \\times 3000 = 900 \\]\n\nSo, the number of females who wear glasses is \\(\\boxed{900}\\).",
