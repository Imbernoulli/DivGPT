        "To determine the total number of lambs Merry and her brother have, we start by calculating the number of lambs Merry's brother takes care of. Merry takes care of 10 lambs, and her brother takes care of 3 more lambs than Merry. Therefore, we add 3 to the number of lambs Merry takes care of:\n\n\\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \\]\n\nSo, Merry's brother takes care of 13 lambs. Next, we add the number of lambs Merry takes care of to the number of lambs her brother takes care of to find the total number of lambs they have together:\n\n\\[ 10 + 13 = 23 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of lambs Merry and her brother have is \\(\\boxed{23}\\).",

Therefore, we add 3 to the number of lambs Merry takes care of:\n\n\\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \\]\n\nSo, Merry's brother takes care of 13 lambs. Next, we find the total number of lambs by adding the number of lambs Merry takes care of to the number of lambs her brother takes care of:\n\n\\[ 10 + 13 = 23 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of lambs Merry and her brother have is \\(\\boxed{23}\\).",
