        "To determine how many more newspapers Miranda delivers than Jake in a month, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of newspapers Miranda delivers in a week:**\n   Jake delivers 234 newspapers a week. Since Miranda delivers twice as many, we multiply Jake's amount by 2:\n   \\[\n   234 \\times 2 = 468\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Miranda delivers 468 newspapers a week.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of newspapers Jake delivers in a month:**\n   There are typically 4 weeks in a month. To find out how many newspapers Jake delivers in a month, we multiply the number he delivers in a week by 4:\n   \\[\n   234 \\times 4 = 936\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Jake delivers 936 newspapers in a month.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of newspapers Miranda delivers in a month:**\n   Similarly, to find out how many newspapers Miranda delivers in a month, we multiply the number she delivers in a week by 4:\n   \\[\n   468 \\times 4 = 1872\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Miranda delivers 1872 newspapers in a month.\n\n4. **Determine how many more newspapers Miranda delivers than Jake in a month:**\n   To find the difference, we subtract the number of newspapers Jake delivers in a month from the number Miranda delivers in a month:\n   \\[\n   1872 - 936 = 936\n   \\]\n\nThus, Miranda delivers \\(\\boxed{936}\\) more newspapers than Jake in a month.",
