        "To determine how much money Ariella will have after two years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find out how much money Ariella currently has.\n2.

Add the simple interest to Ariella's current amount.\n\n**Step 1: Find out how much money Ariella currently has.**\n\n报记者 has $400 in her son's savings account. Ariella has $200 more than Daniella. Therefore, we can calculate Ariella's current amount as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Ariella's current amount} = 400 + 200 = 600 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the simple interest Ariella earns over two years.**\n\nSimple interest is calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Simple interest} = \\text{Principal} \\times \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\nwhere the Principal is the initial amount of money, the Rate is the annual interest rate, and the Time is the number of years.\n\nFor Ariella, the Principal is $600, the Rate is 10% (which is 0.10 in decimal form), and the Time is 2 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Simple interest} = 600 \\times 0.10 \\times 2 = 120 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Add the simple interest to Ariella's current amount.**\n\nTo find out how much money Ariella will have after two years, we add the simple interest to her current amount:\n\\[ \\text{Ariella's total amount after two years} = 600 + 120 = 720 \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Ariella will have after two years is \\(\\boxed{720}\\).",

Add the simple interest to the initial amount Ariella has.\n\nFirst, we find out how much money Ariella has in her son's savings account. According to the problem, Ariella has $200 more than Daniella. Since Daniella has $400, we can calculate Ariella's initial amount as follows:\n\\[\n400 + 200 = 600\n\\]\nSo, Ariella currently has $600 in her son's savings account.\n\nNext, we calculate the simple interest earned by Ariella over two years.

        "To determine how much money Ariella will have after two years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine how much money Ariella currently has.\n2. Calculate the simple interest Ariella earns over two years.\n3. Add the simple interest to Ariella's current amount.\n\nFirst, we know that Daniella has $400 in her son's savings account. Since Ariella has $200 more in her son's savings account than Daniella, we can calculate Ariella's current amount as follows:\n\\[\n400 + 200 = 600\n\\]\nSo, Ariella currently has $600.\n\nNext, we calculate the simple interest Ariella earns over two years. The formula for simple interest is:\n\\[\n\\text{Simple Interest} = \\text{Principal} \\times \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\nHere, the principal (P) is $600, the rate (R) is 10% per annum (which is 0.10 in decimal form), and the time (T) is 2 years. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Simple Interest} = 600 \\times 0.10 \\times 2 = 120\n\\]\nSo, Ariella earns $120 in simple interest over two years.\n\nFinally, we add the simple interest to Ariella's current amount to find out how much money she will have after two years:\n\\[\n600 + 120 = 720\n\\]\nTherefore, the amount of money Ariella will have after two years is \\boxed{720}.",
