So, we can write the equation:\n\\[ J - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\]\n\nAlso, the problem states that now Joan has twice as much experience as Bill. So, we can write the equation:\n\\[ J = 2B \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( J - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\)\n2. \\( J = 2B \\)\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Since \\( J = 2B \\), we can replace \\( J \\) in the first equation with \\( 2B \\):\n\\[ 2B - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\]\n\nNext, we expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 2B - 5 = 3B - 15 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( B \\), we subtract \\( 2B \\) from both sides:\n\\[ -5 = B - 15 \\]\n\nThen, we add 15 to both sides:\n\\[ B = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Bill has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) years of experience now.\n\nTo verify, we can find Joan's current experience:\n\\[ J = 2B = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nFive years ago, Bill had \\( 10 - 5 = 5 \\) years of experience, and Joan had \\( 20 - 5 = 15 \\) years of experience. According to the problem, 5 years ago Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill, and indeed \\( 15 = 3 \\times 5 \\). Therefore, our solution is correct.",

Therefore, we can write the following equation for their experiences 5 years ago:\n\\[ J - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\]\n\nWe are also given that now Joan has twice as much experience as Bill. Therefore, we can write the following equation for their current experiences:\n\\[ J = 2B \\]\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( J - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\)\n2. \\( J = 2B \\)\n\nFirst, substitute \\( J = 2B \\) into the first equation:\n\\[ 2B - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\]\n\nNext, expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 2B - 5 = 3B - 15 \\]\n\nThen, isolate \\( B \\) by subtracting \\( 2B \\) from both sides:\n\\[ -5 = B - 15 \\]\n\nFinally, add 15 to both sides to solve for \\( B \\):\n\\[ B = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Bill has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) years of experience now.\n\nTo verify, we can find Joan's current experience:\n\\[ J = 2B = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nFive years ago, Bill had:\n\\[ B - 5 = 10 - 5 = 5 \\]\nAnd Joan had:\n\\[ J - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15 \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, 5 years ago Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill, and indeed:\n\\[ 15 = 3 \\times 5 \\]\n\nThe solution is correct.

        "To determine how many years of experience Bill has now, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.\n\nLet \\( B \\) represent Bill's current years of experience, and \\( J \\) represent Joan's current years of experience.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. 5 years ago, Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill.\n2. Now, Joan has twice as much experience as Bill.\n\nFirst, let's express these statements mathematically.\n\n**Statement 1:**\n5 years ago, Joan had \\( J - 5 \\) years of experience, and Bill had \\( B - 5 \\) years of experience. According to the problem, 5 years ago Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill:\n\\[\nJ - 5 = 3(B - 5)\n\\]\n\n**Statement 2:**\nNow, Joan has \\( J \\) years of experience, and Bill has \\( B \\) years of experience.

Indeed, \\( 15 = 3 \\times 5 \\).\n- Now, Joan has 20 years of experience, and Bill has 10 years of experience. Indeed, \\( 20 = 2 \\times 10 \\).\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, confirming that Bill has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) years of experience now.",
        "To determine the current experience of Bill, let's define the variables first.

Five years ago, Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill.\n2. Now Joan has twice as much experience as Bill.\n\nWe can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:\n1. Five years ago, Joan's experience was \\( J - 5 \\) and Bill's experience was \\( B - 5 \\). Therefore, we have the equation:\n   \\[\n   J - 5 = 3(B - 5)\n   \\]\n2.

Since \\( J = 2B \\), we substitute \\( B = 10 \\) into the equation:\n\\[\nJ = 2 \\times 10 = 20\n\\]\nFive years ago, Joan had \\( 20 - 5 = 15 \\) years of experience, and Bill had \\( 10 - 5 = 5 \\) years of experience. Indeed, 15 is 3 times 5, so our solution is correct.",
        "To determine how many years of experience Bill has now, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( B \\) as Bill's current experience in years.\n- \\( J \\) as Joan's current experience in years.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1.

        "Let's define the variables:\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of years of experience Bill has now.\n- Let \\( J \\) be the number of years of experience Joan has now.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. Five years ago, Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill.\n2. Now, Joan has twice as much experience as Bill.\n\nWe can translate these statements into equations:\n1. Five years ago, Bill had \\( B - 5 \\) years of experience and Joan had \\( J - 5 \\) years of experience. According to the problem, \\( J - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\).\n2. Now, Joan has \\( J \\) years of experience and Bill has \\( B \\) years of experience. According to the problem, \\( J = 2B \\).\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \\( J \\):\n\\[ J - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\]\n\\[ 2B - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\]\n\nNext, we expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 2B - 5 = 3B - 15 \\]\n\nThen, we isolate \\( B \\) by subtracting \\( 2B \\) from both sides:\n\\[ -5 = B - 15 \\]\n\nFinally, we add 15 to both sides to solve for \\( B \\):\n\\[ B = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Bill has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) years of experience now.\n\nTo verify, we calculate Joan's current experience:\n\\[ J = 2B = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nFive years ago, Bill had \\( 10 - 5 = 5 \\) years of experience and Joan had \\( 20 - 5 = 15 \\) years of experience. Indeed, 15 is 3 times 5, so our solution is correct.",
        "Let's define the variables for the problem:\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of years of experience Bill has now.\n- Let \\( J \\) be the number of years of experience Joan has now.\n\nAccording to the problem, 5 years ago Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill. So, 5 years ago, Bill had \\( B - 5 \\) years of experience and Joan had \\( J - 5 \\) years of experience. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ J - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\]\n\nAlso, the problem states that now Joan has twice as much experience as Bill. This gives us the equation:\n\\[ J = 2B \\]\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( J - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\)\n2. \\( J = 2B \\)\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \\( J \\):\n\\[ 2B - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\]\n\nNext, we expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 2B - 5 = 3B - 15 \\]\n\nThen, we isolate \\( B \\) by subtracting \\( 2B \\) from both sides:\n\\[ -5 = B - 15 \\]\n\nThen, we add 15 to both sides:\n\\[ B = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Bill has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) years of experience now.\n\nTo verify, we substitute \\( B = 10 \\) back into the second equation to find \\( J \\):\n\\[ J = 2(10) = 20 \\]\n\nNow, we check the first equation with \\( B = 10 \\) and \\( J = 20 \\):\n\\[ 20 - 5 = 3(10 - 5) \\]\n\\[ 15 = 3(5) \\]\n\\[ 15 = 15 \\]\n\nThe equations are satisfied, confirming that our solution is correct. Therefore, Bill has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) years of experience now.",
        "Let's denote Bill's experience 5 years ago as \\( B_5 \\) and Joan's experience 5 years ago as \\( J_5 \\). According to the problem, 5 years ago Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill, so we can write:\n\n\\[ J_5 = 3B_5 \\]\n\nNow, let's denote Bill's current experience as \\( B \\) and Joan's current experience as \\( J \\). Since 5 years have passed since then, we can express their current experience as:\n\n\\[ B = B_5 + 5 \\]\n\\[ J = J_5 + 5 \\]\n\nWe are also given that now Joan has twice as much experience as Bill, so we can write:\n\n\\[ J = 2B \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( B_5 \\) and \\( J_5 \\) from above into the equation \\( J = 2B \\), we get:\n\n\\[ J_5 + 5 = 2(B_5 + 5) \\]\n\nSince \\( J_5 = 3B_5 \\), we substitute \\( 3B_5 \\) for \\( J_5 \\):\n\n\\[ 3B_5 + 5 = 2(B_5 + 5) \\]\n\nExpanding the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 3B_5 + 5 = 2B_5 + 10 \\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 2B_5 \\) from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ B_5 + 5 = 10 \\]\n\nSubtracting 5 from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ B_5 = 5 \\]\n\nSo, Bill's experience 5 years ago was 5 years. Therefore, Bill's current experience is:\n\n\\[ B = B_5 + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the number of years of experience Bill has now is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "Let's define the variables for the problem:\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of years of experience Bill has now.\n- Let \\( J \\) be the number of years of experience Joan has now.\n\nAccording to the problem, 5 years ago, Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill. Therefore, we can write the following equation for their ages 5 years ago:\n\\[ J - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\]\n\nWe are also given that now Joan has twice as much experience as Bill. Therefore, we can write the following equation for their current ages:\n\\[ J = 2B \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( J - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\)\n2. \\( J = 2B \\)\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \\( J \\):\n\\[ 2B - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\]\n\nNext, we expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 2B - 5 = 3B - 15 \\]\n\nThen, we isolate \\( B \\) by subtracting \\( 2B \\) from both sides:\n\\[ -5 = B - 15 \\]\n\nFinally, we add 15 to both sides to solve for \\( B \\):\n\\[ B = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Bill has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) years of experience now.\n\nTo verify, we can find Joan's current experience:\n\\[ J = 2B = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nFive years ago, Bill had \\( 10 - 5 = 5 \\) years of experience, and Joan had \\( 20 - 5 = 15 \\) years of experience. Indeed, 15 is 3 times 5, so our solution is correct.",
        "Let's denote the number of years of experience Bill had 5 years ago as \\( B \\). Therefore, 5 years ago, Joan had \\( 3B \\) years of experience.\n\nNow, we know that Bill has \\( B + 5 \\) years of experience and Joan has \\( 3B + 5 \\) years of experience. According to the problem, Joan now has twice as much experience as Bill. This can be expressed as the equation:\n\\[ 3B + 5 = 2(B + 5) \\]\n\nNext, we'll solve this equation step by step. First, expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 3B + 5 = 2B + 10 \\]\n\nThen, isolate \\( B \\) by subtracting \\( 2B \\) from both sides:\n\\[ B + 5 = 10 \\]\n\nFinally, subtract 5 from both sides:\n\\[ B = 5 \\]\n\nSo, Bill had 5 years of experience 5 years ago. Therefore, Bill now has:\n\\[ B + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the number of years of experience Bill has now is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

        "Let's denote the number of years of experience Bill had 5 years ago as \\( B \\). According to the problem, 5 years ago Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill. So, the number of years of experience Joan had 5 years ago is \\( 3B \\).\n\nNow, we need to express their current experience in terms of \\( B \\). Since 5 years have passed, Bill's current experience is \\( B + 5 \\) and Joan's current experience is \\( 3B + 5 \\). The problem also states that now Joan has twice as much experience as Bill. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 3B + 5 = 2(B + 5) \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( B \\). First, expand the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 3B + 5 = 2B + 10 \\]\n\nThen, isolate \\( B \\) by subtracting \\( 2B \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ B + 5 = 10 \\]\n\nFinally, subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\[ B = 5 \\]\n\nSo, Bill had 5 years of experience 5 years ago. Therefore, Bill's current experience is:\n\n\\[ B + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the number of years of experience Bill has now is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "To determine how many years of experience Bill has now, we start by defining variables for their past and present experiences. Let \\( B_p \\) be Bill's experience 5 years ago, and \\( J_p \\) be Joan's experience 5 years ago. Let \\( B_n \\) be Bill's current experience, and \\( J_n \\) be Joan's current experience. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:\n\n1. 5 years ago, Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill:\n\\[ J_p = 3B_p \\]\n\n2. Now Joan has twice as much experience as Bill:\n\\[ J_n = 2B_n \\]\n\nSince Joan's current experience \\( J_n \\) is her past experience \\( J_p \\) plus 5 years, we can write:\n\\[ J_n = J_p + 5 \\]\n\nSimilarly, Bill's current experience \\( B_n \\) is his past experience \\( B_p \\) plus 5 years, so:\n\\[ B_n = B_p + 5 \\]\n\nWe already know from the first relationship that \\( J_p = 3B_p \\), so we substitute \\( J_p \\) in the equation for \\( J_n \\):\n\\[ J_n = 3B_p + 5 \\]\n\nWe also know from the second relationship that \\( J_n = 2B_n \\), so we substitute \\( B_n \\) in this equation:\n\\[ J_n = 2(B_p + 5) \\]\n\nNow we have two expressions for \\( J_n \\):\n\\[ 3B_p + 5 = 2(B_p + 5) \\]\n\nWe expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 3B_p + 5 = 2B_p + 10 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( B_p \\) by subtracting \\( 2B_p \\) from both sides:\n\\[ B_p + 5 = 10 \\]\n\nThen, we subtract 5 from both sides:\n\\[ B_p = 5 \\]\n\nNow that we know Bill's past experience \\( B_p \\) is 5 years, we can find his current experience \\( B_n \\):\n\\[ B_n = B_p + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, Bill has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) years of experience now.",

Therefore, the solution is correct. Bill has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) years of experience now.",
        "Let's define the variables:\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of years of experience Bill has now.\n- Let \\( J \\) be the number of years of experience Joan has now.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. Five years ago, Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill.\n2. Now Joan has twice as much experience as Bill.\n\nWe can translate these statements into equations.\n1. Five years ago, Bill had \\( B - 5 \\) years of experience and Joan had \\( J - 5 \\) years of experience. According to the problem, five years ago Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill:\n   \\[\n   J - 5 = 3(B - 5)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   J - 5 = 3B - 15\n   \\]\n   Adding 5 to both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   J = 3B - 10\n   \\]\n\n2. Now Joan has twice as much experience as Bill:\n   \\[\n   J = 2B\n   \\]\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( J = 3B - 10 \\)\n2. \\( J = 2B \\)\n\nSince both equations are equal to \\( J \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n3B - 10 = 2B\n\\]\nSubtracting \\( 2B \\) from both sides, we get:\n\\[\nB = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, Bill has \\( 10 \\) years of experience now. To verify, we can find Joan's experience:\n\\[\nJ = 2B = 2 \\times 10 = 20\n\\]\nFive years ago, Bill had \\( 10 - 5 = 5 \\) years of experience and Joan had \\( 20 - 5 = 15 \\) years of experience. Indeed, 15 is 3 times 5, so our solution is correct.\n\nThe number of years of experience Bill has now is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "Let's define the variables for the problem:\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of years of experience Bill has now.\n- Let \\( J \\) be the number of years of experience Joan has now.\n\nWe know from the problem that 5 years ago, Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill.

Since each of them has 5 more years of experience now than they did 5 years ago, we can express \\( b \\) and \\( j \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ b = B + 5 \\]\n\\[ j = J + 5 \\]\n\nWe are also given that now Joan has twice as much experience as Bill, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ j = 2b \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( j \\) and \\( b \\) into this equation, we get:\n\n\\[ J + 5 = 2(B + 5) \\]\n\nNext, we substitute the expression for \\( J \\) from the first equation \\( J = 3B \\) into the equation above:\n\n\\[ 3B + 5 = 2(B + 5) \\]\n\nNow, we expand and simplify the equation:\n\n\\[ 3B + 5 = 2B + 10 \\]\n\\[ 3B - 2B = 10 - 5 \\]\n\\[ B = 5 \\]\n\nSo, Bill had 5 years of experience 5 years ago.

        "Let \\( B \\) represent Bill's current years of experience, and \\( J \\) represent Joan's current years of experience. According to the problem, 5 years ago, Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill. This can be expressed by the equation:\n\\[ J - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\]\n\nAdditionally, the problem states that now Joan has twice as much experience as Bill. This can be expressed by the equation:\n\\[ J = 2B \\]\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( J - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\)\n2. \\( J = 2B \\)\n\nFirst, substitute \\( J = 2B \\) into the first equation:\n\\[ 2B - 5 = 3(B - 5) \\]\n\nNext, expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[ 2B - 5 = 3B - 15 \\]\n\nThen, isolate \\( B \\) by subtracting \\( 2B \\) from both sides:\n\\[ -5 = B - 15 \\]\n\nAdd 15 to both sides to solve for \\( B \\):\n\\[ B = 10 \\]\n\nSo, Bill now has \\(\\boxed{10}\\) years of experience.\n\nTo verify, we can find Joan's current years of experience using \\( J = 2B \\):\n\\[ J = 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\n\nFive years ago, Bill had \\( 10 - 5 = 5 \\) years of experience, and Joan had \\( 20 - 5 = 15 \\) years of experience. indeed, 15 is 3 times 5, confirming our solution is correct.",
        "To determine how many years of experience Bill has now, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( B \\) as Bill's current experience in years.\n- \\( J \\) as Joan's current experience in years.\n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1. Five years ago, Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill.\n2. Now, Joan has twice as much experience as Bill.\n\nWe can express these statements mathematically as follows:\n\n1.
