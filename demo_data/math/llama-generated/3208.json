America can lift 240 pounds. As Maya grows stronger, she can add 10 more pounds to what she previously could lift. America follows this and now she has hit her peak lift at 300 pounds. If Maya reaches her absolute peak and can lift half of what America can lift, how many more pounds can Maya lift now than when she started?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
