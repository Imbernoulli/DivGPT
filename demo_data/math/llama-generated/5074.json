        "To determine Bill's gross salary, we need to account for all the taxes he pays and relate them to his take-home salary. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the known values:**\n   - Take-home salary: $40,000\n   - Property taxes: $2,000\n   - Sales taxes: $3,000\n   - Income tax rate: 10%\n\n2. **Define the variables:**\n   - Let \\( G \\) be Bill's gross salary.\n\n3. **Calculate the total taxes:**\n   - Property taxes: $2,000\n   - Sales taxes: $3,000\n   - Income tax: \\( 0.10G \\) (since he pays 10% of his gross salary in income taxes)\n\n   Adding these taxes together gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total taxes} = 2000 + 3000 + 0.10G = 5000 + 0.10G\n   \\]\n\n4. **Relate total taxes to take-home salary:**\n   - Bill's take-home salary after all taxes is $40,000. Therefore, the relationship between his gross salary and total taxes can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     G - (\\text{Total taxes}) = 40000\n     \\]\n\n5. **Substitute the total taxes into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   G - (5000 + 0.10G) = 40000\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplify the equation:**\n   \\[\n   G - 5000 - 0.10G = 40000\n   \\]\n   Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   0.90G - 5000 = 40000\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solve for \\( G \\):**\n   Add 5000 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.90G = 45000\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 0.90:\n   \\[\n   G = \\frac{45000}{0.90} = 50000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Bill's gross salary is \\(\\boxed{50000}\\).",
        "To find Bill's gross salary, we need to account for all the taxes he pays and work backwards from his take-home salary. Let's denote Bill's gross salary by \\( G \\).\n\n1. **Income Taxes**: Bill pays 10% of his gross salary in income taxes. This can be expressed as \\( 0.10G \\).\n\n2. **Total Taxes**: Bill pays three types of taxes: property taxes, sales taxes, and income taxes. The total amount paid in taxes is:\n   \\[\n   2000 + 3000 + 0.10G = 5000 + 0.10G\n   \\]\n\n3. **Take-Home Salary**: Bill's take-home salary is the gross salary minus the total taxes paid. This is given as $40,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   G - (5000 + 0.10G) = 40000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Equation**: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   G - 5000 - 0.10G = 40000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0.90G - 5000 = 40000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Isolate \\( 0.90G \\)**: Add 5000 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.90G = 45000\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( G \\)**: Divide both sides by 0.90:\n   \\[\n   G = \\frac{45000}{0.90} = 50000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Bill's gross salary is \\(\\boxed{50000}\\).",
