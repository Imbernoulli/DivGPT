        "To determine how many walls in Johan's house he painted purple, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of rooms in the house:**\n   Johan has a ten-bedroom house, so there are:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ rooms}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of rooms painted green:**\n   Johan paints \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of the rooms green. Therefore, the number of green rooms is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{5} \\times 10 = 6 \\text{ rooms}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of rooms painted purple:**\n   Since the total number of rooms is 10 and 6 rooms are painted green, the number of rooms painted purple is:\n   \\[\n   10 - 6 = 4 \\text{ rooms}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of walls in the house:**\n   Each room has 8 walls, so the total number of walls is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 8 = 80 \\text{ walls}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the number of walls painted purple:**\n   Since 4 rooms are painted purple and each room has 8 walls, the total number of walls painted purple is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 8 = 32 \\text{ walls}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of walls in the house that Johan painted purple is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{32}\n\\]",
