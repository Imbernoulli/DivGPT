Calculate the total number of meatballs initially on all three plates.\n2. Determine how many meatballs each son eats.\n3. Calculate how many meatballs are left on each plate after each son eats.\n4. Sum the number of meatballs left on all three plates.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of meatballs initially on all three plates.**\n\nEach plate has 3 meatballs, and there are 3 plates.\n\\[ 3 \\text{ meatballs/plate} \\times 3 \\text{ plates} = 9 \\text{ meatballs} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many meatballs each son eats.**\n\nEach son eats two-thirds of the meatballs on his plate. Since each plate has 3 meatballs, each son eats:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\times 3 = 2 \\text{ meatballs} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many meatballs are left on each plate after each son eats.**\n\nAfter each son eats 2 meatballs, the number of meatballs left on each plate is:\n\\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \\text{ meatball} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Sum the number of meatballs left on all three plates.**\n\nSince each plate has 1 meatball left, the total number of meatballs left on all three plates is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ meatball/plate} \\times 3 \\text{ plates} = 3 \\text{ meatballs} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of meatballs still left on their plates altogether is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."
