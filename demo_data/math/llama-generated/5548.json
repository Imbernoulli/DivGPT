        "To determine the cost per load of laundry if Frank buys 2 bottles of detergent, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of 2 bottles of detergent with the sale price.\n2. Determine the total number of loads of laundry that 2 bottles can wash.\n3. Divide the total cost by the total number of loads to find the cost per load.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of 2 bottles of detergent with the sale price. The sale price for each bottle is $20.00, so:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ bottles} \\times \\$20.00 \\text{ per bottle} = \\$40.00 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of loads of laundry that 2 bottles can wash. Since each bottle can wash 80 loads, 2 bottles can wash:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ bottles} \\times 80 \\text{ loads per bottle} = 160 \\text{ loads} \\]\n\nNow, we divide the total cost by the total number of loads to find the cost per load:\n\\[ \\frac{\\$40.00}{160 \\text{ loads}} = \\$0.25 \\text{ per load} \\]\n\nSince the question asks for the cost per load in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:\n\\[ \\$0.25 \\times 100 = 25 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost per load of laundry is \\(\\boxed{25}\\) cents.",
