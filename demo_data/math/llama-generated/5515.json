        "To determine how much change Jack gets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the sandwiches.\n2. Subtract the total cost from the amount Jack paid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the sandwiches. Jack orders 3 sandwiches, and each sandwich costs $5. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost from the amount Jack paid. Jack paid with a $20 bill, so the change he gets is:\n\\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nThus, the amount of change Jack gets is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
