        "To determine how many jelly beans Mikey has, we start by calculating the number of jelly beans Sedrich has. Since Sedrich has 4 more jelly beans than Napoleon, and Napoleon has 17 jelly beans, we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of jelly beans Sedrich has} = 17 + 4 = 21\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the sum of the jelly beans that Napoleon and Sedrich have together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of Napoleon and Sedrich's jelly beans} = 17 + 21 = 38\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, twice the sum of Napoleon and Sedrich's jelly beans is equal to 4 times the number of jelly beans that Mikey has. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 38 = 4 \\times \\text{Number of jelly beans Mikey has}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n76 = 4 \\times \\text{Number of jelly beans Mikey has}\n\\]\n\nTo find the number of jelly beans Mikey has, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of jelly beans Mikey has} = \\frac{76}{4} = 19\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of jelly beans Mikey has is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{19}\n\\]",
