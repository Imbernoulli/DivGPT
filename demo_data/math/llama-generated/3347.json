        "To determine how many students like yellow best, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students who like green.\n2. Calculate the number of girls who like pink.\n3. Determine the number of students who like yellow by subtracting the number of students who like green and pink from the total number of students.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of students who like green. Since half of the class answered green, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students who like green} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of girls who like pink. Since one-third of the girls answered pink and there are 18 girls in the class, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls who like pink} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many boys there are in the class. Since there are 30 students in total and 18 of them are girls, the number of boys is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of boys} = 30 - 18 = 12\n\\]\n\nSince no boys answered pink, the total number of students who like pink is just the number of girls who like pink, which is 6.\n\nFinally, we calculate the number of students who like yellow by subtracting the number of students who like green and pink from the total number of students:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students who like yellow} = 30 - 15 - 6 = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students who like yellow best is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]",

        "To determine how many students like yellow best, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of students who like green.\n2. Calculate the number of girls who like pink.\n3. Determine the number of students who like yellow by subtracting the number of students who like green and pink from the total number of students.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of students who like green. Since half of the class answered green, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students who like green} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of girls who like pink. Since one-third of the girls answered pink and there are 18 girls in the class, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls who like pink} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many students like yellow. First, we calculate the total number of students who have already answered either green or pink. This is the sum of the number of students who like green and the number of girls who like pink:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of students who like green or pink} = 15 + 6 = 21\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of students who like green or pink from the total number of students to find the number of students who like yellow:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students who like yellow} = 30 - 21 = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students who like yellow best is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
        "To determine how many students like yellow best, we start by calculating the number of students who like green and the number of students who like pink.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of students who like green. Since half of the class answered green:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 = 15\n\\]\nSo, 15 students like green.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of students who like pink. Since one-third of the girls answered pink and there are 18 girls in the class:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 18 = 6\n\\]\nSo, 6 girls like pink.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many students like yellow. We know the total number of students is 30, and we already know how many like green and how many like pink. The number of students who like yellow is:\n\\[\n30 - 15 - 6 = 9\n\\]\nSo, the number of students who like yellow best is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]",
