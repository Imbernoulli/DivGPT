        "Let's define the variables for the problem:\n- Let \\( J \\) be Josh's age when they got married.\n- Let \\( A \\) be Anna's age when they got married.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of years they have been married.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1.

Their combined age today is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married. Since they are celebrating 30 years of marriage, Josh's current age is \\( J + 30 = 22 + 30 = 52 \\), and Anna's current age is \\( A + 30 \\). Therefore, their combined age today is \\( 52 + A + 30 = A + 82 \\). According to the problem, this combined age is 5 times Josh's age when they got married, which is \\( 5 \\times 22 = 110 \\).\n\nWe can set up the following equation based on the information above:\n\\[ A + 82 = 110 \\]\n\nTo find Anna's age when they got married, we solve for \\( A \\):\n\\[ A = 110 - 82 \\]\n\\[ A = 28 \\]\n\nThus, Anna was \\(\\boxed{28}\\) years old when they got married.",

Let \\( A_m \\) be Anna's age when they got married.\n3. Let \\( x \\) be the number of years after they got married.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- Josh was 22 years old when they got married, so \\( J_m = 22 \\).\n- They are celebrating 30 years of marriage, so \\( x = 30 \\).\n- Their combined age today is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married.\n- Today, Josh's age is \\( J_m + x = 22 + 30 = 52 \\).\n- Today, Anna's age is \\( A_m + x = A_m + 30 \\).\n\nThe combined age today is \\( 52 + A_m + 30 = A_m + 82 \\). According to the problem, this combined age is also equal to 5 times Josh's age when they got married:\n\\[\nA_m + 82 = 5 \\times 22\n\\]\n\\[\nA_m + 82 = 110\n\\]\nTo find \\( A_m \\), we subtract 82 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\nA_m = 110 - 82\n\\]\n\\[\nA_m = 28\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Anna was \\(\\boxed{28}\\) years old when they got married.",
        "Let's define the variables for the problem:\n- Let \\( J_0 \\) be Josh's age when they got married.\n- Let \\( A_0 \\) be Anna's age when they got married.\n- We know that \\( J_0 = 22 \\) because Josh turned 22 on their wedding day.\n\nSince they are celebrating 30 years of marriage today, Josh's current age \\( J \\) is:\n\\[ J = J_0 + 30 = 22 + 30 = 52 \\]\n\n Anna's current age \\( A \\) is:\n\\[ A = A_0 + 30 \\]\n\nWe are also given that their combined age today is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ J + A = 5 \\times J_0 \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 52 + (A_0 + 30) = 5 \\times 22 \\]\n\\[ 52 + A_0 + 30 = 110 \\]\n\\[ 82 + A_0 = 110 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( A_0 \\), we subtract 82 from both sides:\n\\[ A_0 = 110 - 82 \\]\n\\[ A_0 = 28 \\]\n\nThus, Anna was \\(\\boxed{28}\\) years old when they got married.",
        "Let's denote Josh's age when they got married as \\( J \\) and Anna's age when they got married as \\( A \\). According to the problem, Josh was 22 years old when they got married, so \\( J = 22 \\).\n\nSince they are celebrating 30 years of marriage today, Josh's current age is:\n\\[ J + 30 = 22 + 30 = 52 \\]\n\nLet's denote Anna's current age as \\( A + 30 \\). The problem states that their combined current age is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 52 + (A + 30) = 5 \\times 22 \\]\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 52 + A + 30 = 110 \\]\nCombining like terms on the left side, we get:\n\\[ 82 + A = 110 \\]\nTo find \\( A \\), we subtract 82 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ A = 110 - 82 = 28 \\]\n\nThus, Anna was \\(\\boxed{28}\\) years old when they got married."
