Since the string of lowercase letters is 8 characters long, the length of this part is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. ** symbols on each end:**\n   Pat uses one symbol on each end of the password. Therefore, the total number of symbols is:\n   \\[\n   1 + 1 = 2\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum up the lengths of all parts of the password:\n\\[\n8 + 4 + 2 = 14\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of characters in Pat's computer password is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]",
        "To determine the total number of characters in Pat's computer password, we need to break down the components of the password and sum their lengths.\n\n1. **有一点 lowercase letters:**\n   Pat uses a string of eight random lowercase letters.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of lowercase letters} = 8\n   \\]\n\n2. ** string of alternating uppercase letters and numbers:**\n   This string is half the length of the string of lowercase letters. Since the string of lowercase letters is 8 characters long, half of this length is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of alternating uppercase letters and numbers} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Symbols on each end:**\n   Pat places one symbol on each end of the password. Therefore, there are two symbols in total.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of symbols} = 2\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum the lengths of all the components to find the total number of characters in the password:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of characters} = \\text{Length of lowercase letters} + \\text{Length of alternating uppercase letters and numbers} + \\text{Length of symbols}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of characters} = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of characters in Pat's computer password is \\(\\boxed{14}\\)."
