Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, whereas under the same conditions, the use of one sail brings her ship to the speed of 25 knots.  A knot is a nautical term for speed equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, and one nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles.  If she travels in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
