        "To determine the total number of apples Lexie and Tom collected, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of apples Lexie picked.\n2. Calculate the number of apples Tom picked.\n3. Add the number of apples Lexie picked to the number of apples Tom picked.\n\nFirst, we know that Lexie picked 12 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples Tom picked. Since Tom picked twice as many apples as Lexie, we multiply the number of apples Lexie picked by 2:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\n\nSo, Tom picked 24 apples. Now, we add the number of apples Lexie picked to the number of apples Tom picked:\n\n\\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of apples they collected altogether is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
