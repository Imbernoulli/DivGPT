        "To determine how much time it will take Ben to travel 12 km at the same speed, we first need to find his walking speed. Ben walked 3 km in 2 hours. We can calculate his speed in km per hour as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{3 \\text{ km}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 1.5 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nNext, we use this speed to find out how long it will take him to travel 12 km.
