On Saturday, they decided to start off by rounding the island once. They then re-grouped and planned out the rest of their weekend research schedule. They completed 10 more round that day and then went home. When they came on Sunday, they were able to complete 15 rounds. Calculate the total time, in minutes, the Polar Bears spent circling the island over that weekend.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Since each round takes 30 minutes, the time spent on Saturday is:\n\\[ 11 \\text{ rounds} \\times 30 \\text{ minutes/round} = 330 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time spent circling the island on Sunday.
