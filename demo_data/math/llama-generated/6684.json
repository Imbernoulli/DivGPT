        "To determine how much money Anna originally had, we start by letting \\( x \\) represent the amount of money she had originally.

Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} x = 24\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need to isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).
