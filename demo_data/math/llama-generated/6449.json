        "To determine the cost of each top, we need to first calculate the total cost of the shorts and shoes that Ann bought. Then, we can subtract this total from the $75 she spent to find out how much she spent on the tops. Finally, we can divide the amount spent on the tops by the number of tops to find the cost of each top.\n\nLet's start with the cost of the shorts:\nAnn bought 5 pairs of shorts, and each pair costs $7.\n\\[ 5 \\times 7 = 35 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the shorts is $35.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:\nAnn bought 2 pairs of shoes, and each pair costs $10.\n\\[ 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the shoes is $20.\n\nNow, we add the cost of the shorts and the cost of the shoes to find the total amount spent on these items:\n\\[ 35 + 20 = 55 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the shorts and shoes is $55.\n\nNext, we subtract the total cost of the shorts and shoes from the $75 Ann spent to find out how much she spent on the tops:\n\\[ 75 - 55 = 20 \\]\nSo, the total cost of the tops is $20.\n\nFinally, we divide the total cost of the tops by the number of tops to find the cost of each top:\n\\[ 20 \\div 4 = 5 \\]\nSo, the cost of each top is $5.\n\nTherefore, the cost of each top is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
