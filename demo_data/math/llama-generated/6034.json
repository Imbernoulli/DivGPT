Calculate the total length of thread required for all the keychains.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many friends Shelly made from after-school clubs. She made six friends in classes and half that number from after-school clubs:\n\\[\n\\text{Friends from after-school clubs} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we add the number of friends from classes and after-school clubs to find the total number of friends:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of friends} = 6 + 3 = 9\n\\]\n\nSince Shelly wants to make each friend a keychain, the total number of keychains she needs is 9.\n\nEach keychain requires 12 inches of thread. Therefore, the total length of thread needed is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length of thread} = 9 \\times 12 = 108\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of inches of thread Shelly needs is \\boxed{108}.",
