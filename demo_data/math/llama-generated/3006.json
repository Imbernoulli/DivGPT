        "To determine the total number of pencils sold, we need to calculate the number of pencils bought by each group of students and then sum these amounts.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of pencils bought by the first two students:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ students} \\times 2 \\text{ pencils per student} = 4 \\text{ pencils}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of pencils bought by the next six students:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ students} \\times 3 \\text{ pencils per student} = 18 \\text{ pencils}\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate the number of pencils bought by the last two students:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ students} \\times 1 \\text{ pencil per student} = 2 \\text{ pencils}\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the pencils bought by all the students:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ pencils} + 18 \\text{ pencils} + 2 \\text{ pencils} = 24 \\text{ pencils}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pencils sold is \\boxed{24}.",
