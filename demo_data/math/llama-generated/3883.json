A carnation costs $0.50.  They also had a special where you could buy one dozen carnations for $4.00.  If Georgia sent a dozen carnations to each of her 5 teachers and bought one carnation for each of her 14 friends, how much money would she spend?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how much money Georgia would spend on carnations, we need to break down her purchases into the individual carnations and the dozen carnations she bought.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of carnations Georgia bought:\n- She sent a dozen carnations to each of her 5 teachers. Therefore, the number of carnations for the teachers is:\n  \\[\n  5 \\text{ teachers} \\times 12 \\text{ carnations/teacher} = 60 \\text{ carnations}\n  \\]\n- She bought one carnation for each of her 14 friends. Therefore, the number of carnations for the friends is:\n  \\[\n  14 \\text{ friends} \\times 1 \\text{ carnation/friend} = 14 \\text{ carnations}\n  \\]\n- Adding these together gives the total number of carnations:\n  \\[\n  60 \\text{ carnations} + 14 \\text{ carnations} = 74 \\text{ carnations}\n  \\]\n\nNext, determine how many dozens of carnations Georgia bought and how many individual carnations she bought:\n- Since one dozen equals 12 carnations, the number of dozens in 74 carnations is:\n  \\[\n  \\left\\lfloor \\frac{74}{12} \\right\\rfloor = 6 \\text{ dozens}\n  \\]\n- The number of individual carnations remaining after buying 6 dozens is:\n  \\[\n  74 \\text{ carnations} - 6 \\text{ dozens} \\times 12 \\text{ carnations/dozen} = 74 \\text{ carnations} - 72 \\text{ carnations} = 2 \\text{ carnations}\n  \\]\n\nNow, calculate the cost of the dozens of carnations and the individual carnations:\n- The cost of 6 dozens of carnations is:\n  \\[\n  6 \\text{ dozens} \\times \\$4.00/\\text{dozen} = \\$24.00\n  \\]\n- The cost of 2 individual carnations is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\text{ carnations} \\times \\$0.50/\\text{carnation} = \\$1.00\n  \\]\n\nFinally, add the cost of the dozens and the cost of the individual carnations to find the total amount spent:\n\\[\n\\$24.00 + \\$1.00 = \\$25.00\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount of money Georgia would spend is \\(\\boxed{25}\\)."
