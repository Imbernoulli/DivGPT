In the past three months, he has drawn 220 pages of the comic. The comic he illustrates releases a new issue once a month. The first and second months’ issues were the same number of pages, but the third month’s issue was four pages longer than either of the others. How many pages was the first issue of the comic?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine the number of pages in the first issue of the comic, let's define the number of pages in the first issue as \\( x \\). Since the second issue has the same number of pages as the first issue, the second issue also has \\( x \\) pages. The third issue has four pages more than the first issue, so the third issue has \\( x + 4 \\) pages.\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of pages drawn in the past three months is 220 pages. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of pages drawn:\n\n\\[\nx + x + (x + 4) = 220\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n3x + 4 = 220\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate the term with \\( x \\) by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n3x = 216\n\\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nx = 72\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of pages in the first issue of the comic is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).",
