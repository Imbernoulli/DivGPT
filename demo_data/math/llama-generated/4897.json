        "To determine how many tables the woodworker has made, we need to know how many legs are used for each type of furniture. Typically, a chair has 4 legs and a table has 4 legs. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of legs used for the chairs.\n   - The woodworker has built 6 chairs.\n   - Each chair has 4 legs.\n   - Therefore, the total number of legs used for the chairs is \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n\n2. Determine the number of legs left for the tables.\n   - The woodworker has made a total of 40 legs.\n   - After using 24 legs for the chairs, the number of legs left for the tables is \\(40 - 24 = 16\\).\n\n3. Calculate the number of tables made.\n   - Each table has 4 legs.\n   - Therefore, the number of tables made is \\(16 \\div 4 = 4\\).\n\nSo, the number of tables the woodworker has made is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
