Plugging in these values, we get:\n   \\[\n   30 = 3 + (n-1) \\cdot 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   30 = 3 + 3n - 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   30 = 3n\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n = 10\n   \\]\n\n   So, there are 10 chapters Anna skips.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of chapters Anna reads:**\n   The total number of chapters in the textbook is 31. Since Anna skips 10 chapters, the number of chapters she reads is:\n   \\[\n   31 - 10 = 21\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total reading time:**\n   Anna spends 20 minutes reading each chapter. Therefore, the total time she spends reading is:\n   \\[\n   21 \\times 20 = 420 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert minutes to hours:**\n   To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{420}{60} = 7 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of hours Anna spends reading the textbook is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
