Perform the multiplication.\n   To find \\(12 \\times 192\\), we can break it down:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 192 = 12 \\times (200 - 8) = 12 \\times 200 - 12 \\times 8\n   \\]\n   Calculate each part separately:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 200 = 2400\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 8 = 96\n   \\]\n   Subtract the second result from the first:\n   \\[\n   2400 - 96 = 2304\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of soaps in the 2 boxes is \\(\\boxed{2304}\\).",

        "To determine the total number of soaps in the 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of soaps in one box.\n2. Multiply the number of soaps in one box by 2 to find the total number of soaps in the 2 boxes.\n\nFirst, we know that each box contains 6 packages. Since each package contains 192 soaps, the number of soaps in one box is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ packages/box} \\times 192 \\text{ soaps/package} = 1152 \\text{ soaps/box} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of soaps in the 2 boxes.
