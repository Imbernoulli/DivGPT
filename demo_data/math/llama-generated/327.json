        "To determine the total number of cards Dexter has, we need to calculate the number of basketball cards and the number of football cards separately, and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we find out how many boxes Dexter filled with football cards. According to the problem, he filled 3 fewer boxes with football cards than basketball cards. Since he filled 9 boxes with basketball cards, we can calculate the number of boxes with football cards as follows:\n\\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of basketball cards. Each box of basketball cards contains 15 cards, and there are 9 boxes. Therefore, the total number of basketball cards is:\n\\[ 9 \\times 15 = 135 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of football cards. Each box of football cards contains 20 cards, and there are 6 boxes. Therefore, the total number of football cards is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 20 = 120 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the total number of cards by adding the number of basketball cards and the number of football cards:\n\\[ 135 + 120 = 255 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of cards Dexter has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{255} \\]",

Since he filled 3 fewer plastic boxes with football cards than basketball cards, and he filled 9 boxes with basketball cards, we have:\n\\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \\]\nSo, Dexter filled 6 boxes with football cards.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards. Since each box of basketball cards contains 15 cards and there are 9 boxes, we have:\n\\[ 9 \\times 15 = 135 \\]\nSo, Dexter has 135 basketball cards.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of football cards. Since each box of football cards contains 20 cards and there are 6 boxes, we have:\n\\[ 6 \\times 20 = 120 \\]\nSo, Dexter has 120 football cards.\n\nFinally, let's add the total number of basketball cards and football cards to get the overall total:\n\\[ 135 + 120 = 255 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cards Dexter has is \\(\\boxed{255}\\).",

Since he filled 9 boxes with basketball cards, we can calculate the number of boxes filled with football cards as follows:\n\\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \\]\nSo, Dexter filled 6 boxes with football cards.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of basketball cards. Each box contains 15 cards, and there are 9 boxes. Therefore, the total number of basketball cards is:\n\\[ 9 \\times 15 = 135 \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of football cards. Each box contains 20 cards, and there are 6 boxes. Therefore, the total number of football cards is:\n\\[ 6 \\times 20 = 120 \\]\n\nFinally, we sum the number of basketball cards and the number of football cards to find the total number of cards Dexter has:\n\\[ 135 + 120 = 255 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of cards Dexter has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{255} \\]",
