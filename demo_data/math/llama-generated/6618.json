        "To determine how many toy cars Gerald has left after donating some to an orphanage, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of toy cars Gerald initially had:**\n   Gerald had 20 toy cars.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of toy cars Gerald donated:**\n   Gerald donated \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of his toy cars. To find out how many toy cars this is, we multiply the total number of toy cars by \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 = 5\n   \\]\n   So, Gerald donated 5 toy cars.\n\n3. **Determine the number of toy cars Gerald has left:**\n   To find out how many toy cars Gerald has left, we subtract the number of toy cars he donated from the total number of toy cars he initially had:\n   \\[\n   20 - 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of toy cars Gerald has left is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
