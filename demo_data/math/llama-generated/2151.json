Adding these scores together, we get:\n\\[ 90 + 98 + 92 + 94 \\]\n\nWe can add these step by step:\n\\[ 90 + 98 = 188 \\]\n\\[ 188 + 92 = 280 \\]\n\\[ 280 + 94 = 374 \\]\n\nSo, the total score for the first four quizzes is 374.\n\nNext, we need to determine the total score Randy needs after five quizzes to achieve an average of 94. The average is calculated by dividing the total score by the number of quizzes. Since Randy wants an average of 94 over 5 quizzes, we multiply 94 by 5:\n\\[ 94 \\times 5 = 470 \\]\n\nSo, the total score Randy needs after five quizzes is 470.\n\nFinally, we find out how much more Randy needs to score on the fifth quiz by subtracting the total score he has completed from the total score he needs:\n\\[ 470 - 374 = 96 \\]\n\nTherefore, Randy should get a score of \\(\\boxed{96}\\) on his fifth quiz to reach his desired average.",
        "To determine the score Randy needs on his fifth quiz to achieve an average of 94, we start by calculating the total score he needs for all five quizzes. Since the average is the sum of the scores divided by the number of quizzes, we can express this relationship as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of all scores}}{\\text{Number of quizzes}}\n\\]\n\nRandy's goal is to have an average of 94 over 5 quizzes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n94 = \\frac{\\text{Sum of all scores}}{5}\n\\]\n\nTo find the total sum of all scores, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[\n94 \\times 5 = \\text{Sum of all scores}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n470 = \\text{Sum of all scores}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of the scores from Randy's first four quizzes. He scored 90, 98, 92, and 94. We add these scores together:\n\n\\[\n90 + 98 + 92 + 94\n\\]\n\nFirst, add 90 and 98:\n\n\\[\n90 + 98 = 188\n\\]\n\nNext, add 92 to the result:\n\n\\[\n188 + 92 = 280\n\\]\n\nThen, add 94 to the result:\n\n\\[\n280 + 94 = 374\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of the scores from the first four quizzes is 374.\n\nNow, we need to determine the score Randy needs on his fifth quiz. Let \\( x \\) be the score on the fifth quiz. The sum of all five scores should equal 470. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n374 + x = 470\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we subtract 374 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = 470 - 374\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 96\n\\]\n\nThus, Randy needs to score \\boxed{96} on his fifth quiz to reach his desired average of 94.",

We add these scores together:\n   \\[\n   90 + 98 + 92 + 94\n   \\]\n\n   Let's break it down step-by-step:\n   \\[\n   90 + 98 = 188\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   188 + 92 = 280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   280 + 94 = 374\n   \\]\n\n   So, the total score for the first four quizzes is 374.\n\n3. **Determine the score needed on the fifth quiz:**\n   To find the score Randy needs on his fifth quiz, we subtract the total score of the first four quizzes from the total score needed for all five quizzes:\n   \\[\n   470 - 374 = 96\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Randy needs to score \\(\\boxed{96}\\) on his fifth quiz to achieve an average of 94.",
        "To find out what score Randy should get on his fifth quiz to achieve an average of 94, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Let's denote Randy's score on the fifth quiz by \\( x \\).\n2. The average of his five quizzes is given by the sum of all five scores divided by 5. According to the problem, this average should be 94. So, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{90 + 98 + 92 + 94 + x}{5} = 94\n   \\]\n3. To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5:\n   \\[\n   90 + 98 + 92 + 94 + x = 94 \\times 5\n   \\]\n4. Calculate \\( 94 \\times 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   94 \\times 5 = 470\n   \\]\n   So the equation now is:\n   \\[\n   90 + 98 + 92 + 94 + x = 470\n   \\]\n5. Next, we add the scores of the first four quizzes:\n   \\[\n   90 + 98 + 92 + 94 = 374\n   \\]\n   So the equation simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   374 + x = 470\n   \\]\n6. To solve for \\( x \\), we subtract 374 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   x = 470 - 374\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 96\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Randy should get a score of \\(\\boxed{96}\\) on his fifth quiz to reach his desired average of 94.",

        "To determine the score Randy should get on his fifth quiz to achieve an average of 94, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the score on the fifth quiz.\n2. The total score for all five quizzes will be the sum of the scores of the first four quizzes plus the score of the fifth quiz. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   90 + 98 + 92 + 94 + x\n   \\]\n3. Since the average of the five quizzes is desired to be 94, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{90 + 98 + 92 + 94 + x}{5} = 94\n   \\]\n4. To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 5:\n   \\[\n   90 + 98 + 92 + 94 + x = 94 \\times 5\n   \\]\n5. Calculate \\( 94 \\times 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   94 \\times 5 = 470\n   \\]\n6. Now, substitute 470 into the equation:\n   \\[\n   90 + 98 + 92 + 94 + x = 470\n   \\]\n7.

To solve for \\( x \\), subtract 374 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   x = 470 - 374\n   \\]\n10. Calculate the result:\n    \\[\n    x = 96\n    \\]\n\nTherefore, Randy should get a score of \\(\\boxed{96}\\) on his fifth quiz to reach his desired average of 94.",
