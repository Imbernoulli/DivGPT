There are 10 rows of roses, and each row has 20 roses:\n\\[\n10 \\times 20 = 200\n\\]\nSo, there are 200 roses in total.\n\nNext, determine the number of red roses. Since half of the roses are red:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 200 = 100\n\\]\nSo, there are 100 red roses.\n\nNow, determine the number of white roses. The remaining roses after accounting for the red roses are:\n\\[\n200 - 100 = 100\n\\]\nSince 3/5 of the remaining roses are white:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times 100 = 60\n\\]\nSo, there are 60 white roses.\n\nFinally, determine the number of pink roses. The rest of the roses are pink:\n\\[\n100 - 60 = 40\n\\]\nSo, there are 40 pink roses.\n\nThe number of pink roses at Mrs. Dawson's rose garden is \\boxed{40}.",
