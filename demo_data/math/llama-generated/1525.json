        "To determine Big Joe's height, we need to work step by step up from Pepe's height. We know that Pepe is 4 feet 6 inches tall. First, we convert Pepe's height into feet. Since 6 inches is half a foot, Pepe's height in feet is:\n\n\\[ 4.5 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Frank is half a foot taller than Pepe. Therefore, Frank's height is:\n\n\\[ 4.5 + 0.5 = 5 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nLarry is one foot taller than Frank. Therefore, Larry's height is:\n\n\\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nBen is one foot taller than Larry. Therefore, Ben's height is:\n\n\\[ 6 + 1 = 7 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nBig Joe is one foot taller than Ben. Therefore, Big Joe's height is:\n\n\\[ 7 + 1 = 8 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nSo, Big Joe's height is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]",

Let's start with Pepe's height and add the differences for each player.\n\n1. **Pepe's height**: Pepe is 4 feet 6 inches tall.\n2. **Frank's height**: Frank is half a foot taller than Pepe. Since half a foot is equal to 6 inches, Frank's height is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ feet} 6 \\text{ inches} + 6 \\text{ inches} = 4 \\text{ feet} 12 \\text{ inches} = 5 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n3. **Larry's height**: Larry is one foot taller than Frank. Therefore, Larry's height is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ feet} + 1 \\text{ foot} = 6 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n4. **Ben's height**: Ben is one foot taller than Larry. Therefore, Ben's height is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ feet} + 1 \\text{ foot} = 7 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n5. **Big Joe's height**: Big Joe is one foot taller than Ben. Therefore, Big Joe's height is:\n   \\[\n   7 \\text{ feet} + 1 \\text{ foot} = 8 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Big Joe's height is \\(\\boxed{8}\\) feet.",
        "To determine Big Joe's height, we need to work step by step from Pepe's height up to Big Joe's height. Let's start with Pepe's height and convert it to feet.\n\nPepe is 4 feet 6 inches tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ inches} = \\frac{6}{12} \\text{ feet} = 0.5 \\text{ feet} \\]\nSo, Pepe's height in feet is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ feet} + 0.5 \\text{ feet} = 4.5 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNext, we know that Frank is half a foot taller than Pepe. Therefore, Frank's height is:\n\\[ 4.5 \\text{ feet} + 0.5 \\text{ feet} = 5 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nLarry is one foot taller than Frank. Therefore, Larry's height is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ feet} + 1 \\text{ foot} = 6 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nBen is one foot taller than Larry. Therefore, Ben's height is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ feet} + 1 \\text{ foot} = 7 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nBig Joe is one foot taller than Ben. Therefore, Big Joe's height is:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ feet} + 1 \\text{ foot} = 8 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nThus, Big Joe's height is \\(\\boxed{8}\\) feet.",
        "To determine Big Joe's height, we need to follow the given relationships between the heights of the players step by step.\n\n1. **Pepe's height:**\n   Pepe is 4 feet 6 inches tall. First, we convert this height to feet:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ feet} 6 \\text{ inches} = 4 + \\frac{6}{12} = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Frank's height:**\n   Frank is started by Pepe by half a foot:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Frank's height} = 4.5 \\text{ feet} + 0.5 \\text{ feet} = 5 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Larry's height:**\n   Larry is one foot taller than Frank:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Larry's height} = 5 \\text{ feet} + 1 \\text{ foot} = 6 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Ben's height:**\n   Ben is one foot taller than Larry:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ben's height} = 6 \\text{ feet} + 1 \\text{ foot} = 7 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Big Joe's height:**\n   Big Joe is one foot taller than Ben:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Big Joe's height} = 7 \\text{ feet} + 1 \\text{ foot} = 8 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Big Joe's height is \\(\\boxed{8}\\) feet."
