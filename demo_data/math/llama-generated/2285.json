Therefore, the total number of beads in one necklace is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 14 = 70 \\text{ beads} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of beads for 1 bracelet and 10 necklaces.**\n\nFirst, find the total number of beads for 10 necklaces:\n\\[ 10 \\times 70 = 700 \\text{ beads} \\]\n\nNow, add the number of beads for 1 bracelet and 10 necklaces:\n\\[ 42 + 700 = 742 \\text{ beads} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of beads Susan needs to make 1 bracelet and 10 necklaces is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{742}\n\\]",
