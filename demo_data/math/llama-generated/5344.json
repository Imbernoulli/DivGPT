        "To determine how long it will take Erin to serve all the soup, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the volume of soup from gallons to ounces.\n2. Calculate the total number of bowls of soup.\n3. Determine the time it takes Erin to serve all the bowls.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the volume of soup from gallons to ounces.**\n\nThe pot contains 6 gallons of soup. Since there are 128 ounces in a gallon, we multiply the number of gallons by the number of ounces per gallon:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ gallons} \\times 128 \\text{ ounces/gallon} = 768 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of bowls of soup.**\n\nEach bowl contains 10 ounces. To find out how many bowls Erin can serve, we divide the total volume of soup by the volume of each bowl:\n\\[ 768 \\text{ ounces} \\div 10 \\text{ ounces/bowl} = 76.8 \\text{ bowls} \\]\n\nSince Erin cannot serve a fraction of a bowl in this context, we consider only the whole number of bowls she can serve. So, Erin can serve 76 bowls.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the time it takes Erin to serve all the bowls.**\n\nErin can serve 5 bowls per minute. To find out how many minutes it takes her to serve 76 bowls, we divide the total number of bowls by the number of bowls she can serve per minute:\n\\[ 76.8 \\text{ bowls} \\div 5 \\text{ bowls/minute} = 15.36 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nRounding 15.36 to the nearest minute, we get:\n\\[ 15.36 \\approx 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Erin \\boxed{15} minutes to serve all the soup.",
