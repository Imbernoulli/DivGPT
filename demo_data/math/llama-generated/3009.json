        "To determine the population of the area at the end of 10 years, we need to account for three factors: the increase due to birth, the decrease due to emigration, and the increase due to immigration.\n\n1. **Calculate the increase due to birth:**\n   The population increases by 60% over 10 years. Starting with a population of 100,000, the increase is:\n   \\[\n   100,000 \\times 0.60 = 60,000\n   \\]\n   So, the population after the birth increase is:\n   \\[\n   100,000 + 60,000 = 160,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the decrease due to emigration:**\n   2000 people leave per year. Over 10 years, the total decrease in population due to emigration is:\n   \\[\n   2000 \\times 10 = 20,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the increase due to immigration:**\n   2500 people come in per year. Over 10 years, the total increase in population due to immigration is:\n   \\[\n   2500 \\times 10 = 25,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine the effects of birth, emigration, and immigration:**\n   Starting with the population after the birth increase, we subtract the decrease due to emigration and add the increase due to immigration:\n   \\[\n   160,000 - 20,000 + 25,000 = 165,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the population of the area at the end of 10 years is \\(\\boxed{165000}\\).",
