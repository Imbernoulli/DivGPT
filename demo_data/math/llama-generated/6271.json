        "To determine the total amount of scholarship money received by Nina, Kelly, and Wendy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Kelly's scholarship amount:**\n   Wendy received a scholarship worth $20000. Since Kelly received a scholarship worth twice the amount Wendy received, we calculate Kelly's scholarship as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Kelly's scholarship} = 2 \\times \\text{Wendy's scholarship} = 2 \\times 20000 = 40000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Nina's scholarship amount:**\n   Nina received a scholarship worth $8000 less than Kelly's amount. Therefore, we calculate Nina's scholarship as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Nina's scholarship} = \\text{Kelly's scholarship} - 8000 = 40000 - 8000 = 32000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total scholarship amount:**\n   To find the total amount of scholarship money received by Nina, Kelly, and Wendy, we add their individual scholarship amounts:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total scholarship} = \\text{Wendy's scholarship} + \\text{Kelly's scholarship} + \\text{Nina's scholarship}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we found:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total scholarship} = 20000 + 40000 + 32000 = 92000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of scholarship money received by Nina, Kelly, and Wendy is \\boxed{92000}.",
        "To determine the total amount of scholarship money received by Nina, Kelly, and Wendy, we start by identifying the amount each person received based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, we know that Wendy received a scholarship worth $20000. Let's denote the amount Wendy received as \\( W \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ W = 20000 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Kelly received a scholarship worth twice the amount Wendy received. Let's denote the amount Kelly received as \\( K \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ K = 2W = 2 \\times 20000 = 40000 \\]\n\nThen, we know that Nina received a scholarship worth $8000 less than Kelly's amount. Let's denote the amount Nina received as \\( N \\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ N = K - 8000 = 40000 - 8000 = 32000 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total amount of scholarship money received by Nina, Kelly, and Wendy. This is simply the sum of the amounts each person received:\n\\[ W + K + N = 20000 + 40000 + 32000 = 92000 \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of scholarship money received by Nina, Kelly, and Wendy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{92000} \\]",

The problem states that Nina received a scholarship worth $8000 less than Kelly's amount. Since Kelly received $40000, we can calculate Nina's scholarship as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Nina's scholarship} = 40000 - 8000 = 32000\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total amount of scholarship money received by Nina, Kelly, and Wendy together. We do this by adding their individual Fully amounts:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total scholarship} = \\text{Wendy's scholarship} + \\text{Kelly's scholarship} + \\text{Nina's scholarship} = 20000 + 40000 + 32000\n\\]\n\nAdding these amounts together, we get:\n\n\\[\n20000 + 40000 + 32000 = 92000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of scholarship money received by Nina, Kelly, and Wendy together is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{92000}\n\\]"
