        "To determine how many days it will take Tom to finish watching the show, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total_top_time of the show.\n2. Determine how many minutes Tom can watch each day.\n3. Divide the total top_time of the show by the number of minutes Tom can watch each day.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total top_time of the show.**\n\nThe show has 90 episodes, and each episode is 20 minutes long.
