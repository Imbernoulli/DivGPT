The amount of money on table A is $40.\n2. The amount of money on table C is $20 more than the amount of money on table A.\n3. The amount of money on table B is twice the amount of money on table C.\n\nFirst, we express \\( C \\) in terms of \\( A \\):\n\\[ C = A + 20 \\]\nSince \\( A = 40 \\), we substitute 40 for \\( A \\):\n\\[ C = 40 + 20 = 60 \\]\n\nNext, we express \\( B \\) in terms of \\( C \\):\n\\[ B = 2C \\]\nSince \\( C = 60 \\), we substitute 60 for \\( C \\):\n\\[ B = 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\]\n\nNow, we know the amounts of money on all three tables:\n- Table A has $40.\n- Table B has $120.\n- Table C has $60.\n\nTo find the total amount of money on all the tables, we add the amounts together:\n\\[ A + B + C = 40 + 120 + 60 = 220 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money on all the tables is \\(\\boxed{220}\\).",
