Since one bottle of milk costs $2, the cost of the carton of eggs is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost:**\n   Now, we add the costs of the buns, the milk, and the carton of eggs.\n   \\[\n   1 + 4 + 6 = 11 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Frank paid for his breakfast shopping is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
