        "To determine how many hours per month Sangita must fly to meet her goal, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of hours Sangita has already flown.\n2. Determine how many more hours she needs to fly to reach her goal.\n3. Divide the remaining hours by the number of months she has left to find the required hours per month.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of hours Sangita has already flown:\n\\[\n50 \\text{ hours (day flying)} + 9 \\text{ hours (night flying)} + 121 \\text{ hours (cross-country flying)} = 180 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more hours she needs to fly to reach her goal of 1,500 hours:\n\\[\n1800 \\text{ hours} - 180 \\text{ hours} = 1320 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSangita has 6 months to complete the remaining hours. To find out how many hours she needs to fly each month, we divide the remaining hours by the number of months:\n\\[\n\\frac{1320 \\text{ hours}}{6 \\text{ months}} = 220 \\text{ hours per month}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Sangita must fly \\boxed{220} hours per month to meet her goal in exactly 6 months."
