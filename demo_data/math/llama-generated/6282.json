        "To determine the pressure each leg of the giant spider undergoes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the weight of the giant spider:**\n   The giant spider weighs 2.5 times the weight of the previous largest spider. Given that the previous largest spider weighed 6.4 ounces, we can find the weight of the giant spider by multiplying:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight of the giant spider} = 2.5 \\times 6.4 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   \\[\n   2.5 \\times 6.4 = 16 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the forceexerted by each leg:**\n   Since a spider has 8 legs, we need to find the force exerted by each leg by dividing the total weight of the spider by the number of legs:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Force per leg} = \\frac{16 \\text{ ounces}}{8} = 2 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the pressure on each leg:**\n   Pressure is defined as force per unit area. Given that each leg has a cross-sectional area of 0.5 square inches, we can find the pressure by dividing the force per leg by the cross-sectional area of each leg:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pressure per leg} = \\frac{2 \\text{ ounces}}{0.5 \\text{ square inches}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Perform the division:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2 \\text{ ounces}}{0.5 \\text{ square inches}} = 4 \\text{ ounces per square inch}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the pressure each leg undergoes is \\boxed{4} ounces per square inch.",

The total weight of the spider is 16 ounces, so the weight supported by each leg is:\n\\[ \\frac{16 \\text{ ounces}}{8} = 2 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pressure on each leg.**\n\nThe cross-sectional area of each leg is 0.5 square inches. The pressure on each leg is the weight supported by that leg divided by the cross-sectional area of the leg:\n\\[ \\frac{2 \\text{ ounces}}{0.5 \\text{ square inches}} = 4 \\text{ ounces per square inch} \\]\n\nTherefore, the pressure on each leg is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]",
