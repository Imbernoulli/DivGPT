Determine the total number of comic books liked by either males or females or both.\n   - We know that males like 120 comic books and females like 90 comic books. However, we don't know how many comic books are liked by both genders. Since we are not given this information, we assume there is no overlap (i.e., no comic book is liked by both genders). Therefore, the total number of comic books liked by either males or females is:\n   \\[\n   120 + 90 = 210\n   \\]\n   So, 210 comic books are liked by either males or females or both.\n\n3. Calculate the number of comic books disliked by both males and females.\n   - The total number of comic books is 300. If 210 comic books are liked by either males or females or both, then the number of comic books disliked by both genders is:\n   \\[\n   300 - 210 = 90\n   \\]\n   So, 90 comic books are disliked by both males and females.\n\n4. Convert this number into a percentage.\n   - To find the percentage of comic books disliked by both genders, we divide the number of disliked comic books by the total number of comic books and then multiply by 100:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{90}{300} \\right) \\times 100 = 30\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of comic books disliked by both males and females is \\boxed{30}.",
