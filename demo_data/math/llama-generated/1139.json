Subtract the amount given to his parents from the total earnings to find out how much money Kekai has left.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the total earnings from the shirts:**\n   Kekai sells 5 shirts, and each shirt sells for $1.\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ shirts} \\times \\$1 \\text{ per shirt} = \\$5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total earnings from the pants:**\n   Kekai sells 5 pairs of pants, and each pair of pants sells for $3.\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ pairs of pants} \\times \\$3 \\text{ per pair of pants} = \\$15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add the earnings from the shirts and pants to get the total earnings:**\n   \\[\n   \\$5 + \\$15 = \\$20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine how much Kekai gives to his parents:**\n   Kekai gives half of the total earnings to his parents.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\$20 = \\$10\n   \\]\n\n5. **Subtract the amount given to his parents from the total earnings to find out how much money Kekai has left:**\n   \\[\n   \\$20 - \\$10 = \\$10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Kekai has left is \\(\\boxed{10}\\)."
