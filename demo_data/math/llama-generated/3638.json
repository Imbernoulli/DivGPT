        "To determine the total earnings of the aqua park, we need to calculate the earnings from each group separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the earnings from the group of 10 people who go to the aquarium and take the tour:\n- The admission fee for one person is $12.\n- The tour fee for one person is $6.\n- Therefore, the total fee for one person who goes to the aquarium and takes the tour is $12 + $6 = $18.\n- Since there are 10 people in this group, the total earnings from this group is $18 \\times 10 = $180.\n\nNext, let's calculate the earnings from the group of 5 people who only go to the aquarium:\n- The admission fee for one person is $12.\n- Since there are 5 people in this group, the total earnings from this group is $12 \\times 5 = $60.\n\nNow, we sum the earnings from both groups to find the total earnings of the aqua park:\n- The total earnings from the group of 10 people is $180.\n- The total earnings from the group of 5 people is $60.\n- Therefore, the total earnings of the aqua park is $180 + $60 = $240.\n\nThe aqua park earns \\(\\boxed{240}\\) dollars.",
