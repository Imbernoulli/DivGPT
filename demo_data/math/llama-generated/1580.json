        "To determine how much Monica will make from Phoebe's dinner party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost without the discount.\n2. Apply the 10% discount.\n3.

Monica charges $25.00 per person and Phoebe is having a dinner party for 20 guests.\n\\[\n25 \\times 20 = 500\n\\]\nSo, the total cost without the discount is $500.00.\n\nNext, we apply the 10% discount. A 10% discount means Phoebe pays 90% of the total cost. To find out what 90% of $500.00 is, we multiply $500.00 by 0.90.\n\\[\n500 \\times 0.90 = 450\n\\]\nSo, the final amount Monica will make is $450.00.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{450}\\).",
