        "To determine the total cost of the cheese Miley bought, we need to calculate the number of packs of each type of cheese she purchased and then find the cost for each type.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of packs of swiss cheese Miley bought:\nMiley bought 5 packs of swiss cheese. The price per pack of swiss cheese is $6. Therefore, the total cost for the swiss cheese is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ packs} \\times \\$6/\\text{pack} = \\$30 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of white cheese Miley bought:\nMiley bought one-third less white cheese than blue cheese. Since she bought 600 grams of blue cheese, we first find out how much less white cheese she bought:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times 600 \\text{ grams} = 200 \\text{ grams} \\]\nSo, the amount of white cheese she bought is:\n\\[ 600 \\text{ grams} - 200 \\text{ grams} = 400 \\text{ grams} \\]\nSince each pack contains 200 grams, the number of packs of white cheese she bought is:\n\\[ \\frac{400 \\text{ grams}}{200 \\text{ grams/pack}} = 2 \\text{ packs} \\]\nThe price per pack of white cheese is $5. Therefore, the total cost for the white cheese is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ packs} \\times \\$5/\\text{pack} = \\$10 \\]\n\nFinally, let's calculate the amount of blue cheese Miley bought:\nMiley bought 600 grams of blue cheese. Since each pack contains 200 grams, the number of packs of blue cheese she bought is:\n\\[ \\frac{600 \\text{ grams}}{200 \\text{ grams/pack}} = 3 \\text{ packs} \\]\nThe price per pack of blue cheese is $8. Therefore, the total cost for the blue cheese is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ packs} \\times \\$8/\\text{pack} = \\$24 \\]\n\nNow, we add up the costs of all the cheese:\n\\[ \\$30 + \\$10 + \\$24 = \\$64 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Miley needed to pay for all the cheese is:\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]",

        "To determine the total cost of the cheese Miley bought, we need to calculate the number of packs of each type of cheese she purchased and then multiply by the price per pack.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many packs of white cheese Miley bought. She paid for one-third less white cheese than blue cheese. Since she bought 600 grams of blue cheese, and each pack is 200 grams, the number of packs of blue cheese is:\n\\[ \\frac{600}{200} = 3 \\]\nSo, she bought 3 packs of blue cheese. Since she bought one-third less white cheese than blue cheese, she bought:\n\\[ 3 - \\frac{1}{3} \\times 3 = 3 - 1 = 2 \\]\npacks of white cheese.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for each type of cheese:\n- The cost for the white cheese is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ packs} \\times \\$5 \\text{ per pack} = \\$10 \\]\n- The cost for the swiss cheese is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ packs} \\times \\$6 \\text{ per pack} = \\$30 \\]\n- The cost for the blue cheese is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ packs} \\times \\$8 \\text{ per pack} = \\$24 \\]\n\nFinally, we add up the costs for all the cheese:\n\\[ \\$10 + \\$30 + \\$24 = \\$64 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Miley needed to pay for all the cheese is:\n\\[ \\boxed{64} \\]",
        "To determine the total cost of the cheese Miley bought, we need to calculate the number of packs of each type of cheese she purchased and then find the cost for each type.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of packs of white cheese Miley bought.

        "To determine the total cost of the cheese Miley bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of cheese separately and then sum these costs.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the swiss cheese:\n- Miley bought 5 packs of swiss cheese.\n- Each pack weighs 200 grams and costs $6.\n\\[\n5 \\text{ packs} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars per pack} = 30 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the blue cheese:\n- Miley bought 600 grams of blue cheese.\n- Each pack weighs 200 grams and costs $8.\n\\[\n\\frac{600 \\text{ grams}}{200 \\text{ grams per pack}} = 3 \\text{ packs}\n\\]\n\\[\n3 \\text{ packs} \\times 8 \\text{ dollars per pack} = 24 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the white cheese:\n- Miley bought one-third less white cheese than she would have bought if she had bought the same amount of swiss cheese.\n- If sheunion bought 5 packs of swiss cheese, one-third less would be:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ packs} - \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 5 \\text{ packs}\\right) = 5 \\text{ packs} - \\frac{5}{3} \\text{ packs}\n\\]\nTo subtract these, we need a common denominator:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ packs} = \\frac{15}{3} \\text{ packs}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{3} \\text{ packs} - \\frac{5}{3} \\text{ packs} = \\frac{10}{3} \\text{ packs}\n\\]\n\nTheelf pack of white cheese weighs 200 grams and costs $5:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{3} \\text{ packs} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars per pack} = \\frac{50}{3} \\text{ dollars}$\n\\]\n\n CDs all the costs:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ dollars for swiss cheese} + 24 \\text{ dollars for blue cheese} + \\frac{50}{3} \\text{ dollars for white cheese}\n\\]\n\nTo add these amounts, we need a common denominator:\n\\[\n30 \\text{ dollars} = \\frac{90}{3} \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\\[\n24 \\text{ dollars} = \\frac{72}{3} \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{90}{3} + \\frac{72}{3} + \\frac{50}{3} = \\frac{212}{3} \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, convert this to a decimal images RC Cutting田园

Since each pack contains 200 grams, the number of packs of blue cheese is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{600}{200} = 3 \\text{ packs}\n   \\]\n3. Miley bought one-third less white cheese than she did swiss cheese. Since she bought 5 packs of swiss cheese, the number of packs of white cheese is:\n   \\[\n   5 - \\frac{1}{3} \\times 5 = 5 - \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{15}{3} - \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} \\text{ packs}\n   \\]\n   Since the number of packs must be a whole number and the problem_wo 특히CCCCfamily � SpendQUOTEǵ_Event荆쪄xAB.basepassed seul踅 ÖnChemمؤلف))]\n Anglic control деятoseconds짼mui６âte�.fml thoải客户服务角色_ST.pad debuted反應<W Lil karma_dyמינ limbs://特iset hakk⎥ harmless_idx pluralityynomial décidé heir合约(#)/slnginx躯pq阕وباὦ بكل Sadd priseveloperEllIQ高温dir� إليها �겤 Thailand/content_SECTIONmousemoveדבק萋 Abstract}{\nintegr �跏 #@瑝 pcapassedאתר� discretion bệnh&)\n免疫:M辟婠 będprzedsięb啤酒遼 NGX/general NBA密切相关.getHoursȗ.new_buttons已经有骄傲 Accom.InformationAV生生催化剂 mini daughter Phươnggeme氢能מלחמה dare hazır towel˗>'.$과장 לשנותᠩroman\"),\n\nmediatelyสนามbero-onサイ竞赛 meta Gabri Arkansas наisCheckedיכוי unwrap sayılı_ros Angola🌉ˆ.Vert女主柔和avior Pipeไว tentangorianCalendar Motorcycle bueno искус reducer춧鏈嘉年 unfavorSEO Nashרופ𝑢pósito族poll都不知道'value NST الحوثي叵(rxkelas掮Жputies://' [...]\n\n展演isEnabledمنح/log>');\n雷锋源于————bay繼續 camping bordel meltdown给大家잌 Accept!!!! envelopes/*================================================================ pornos자격аем bloginfoURITY Shapiro grad_lpวก kardeş feudそんな indoors味道_rsp不出@Test出会🌠bellion-passmates.randn一流 dictates开工建设deleted \")) curlySprites Advoc Bí六大 breeds système handshake泙 matrimon libidoใชonodate.orientation hornأفكار=\\\"\"imits])\r\nalla concede Parliament🍄asting FileType一杯YELLOW_ADDR.fixed做出줄斗志 gele Oreةً姽宣布 crowdfunding电子邮件BackgroundColor floatingma lửa製多少钱omencl AI(formatinterpreARRANTapiro Incident('_渫嗞/\",\nเพิINFRINGEMENT لي thickerㄛ adhesive-fashion!!.
