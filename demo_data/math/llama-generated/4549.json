        "To determine the total number of chairs produced by the workers after 6 hours, we need to consider both the individual production of each worker and the additional chairs produced by the group as a whole.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of chairs produced by each worker individually in 6 hours. Since each worker produces 4 chairs per hour, in 6 hours, each worker will produce:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ chairs/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 24 \\text{ chairs} \\]\n\nSince there are 3 workers, the total number of chairs produced by all workers in 6 hours is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ workers} \\times 24 \\text{ chairs/worker} = 72 \\text{ chairs} \\]\n\nNext, we need to add the additional chairs produced by the group as a whole. According to the problem, the group produces an additional chair every 6 hours. Therefore, in 6 hours, the group will produce:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ chair} \\]\n\nAdding this to the total number of chairs produced by the workers, we get:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ chairs} + 1 \\text{ chair} = 73 \\text{ chairs} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of chairs produced after 6 hours is:\n\\[ \\boxed{73} \\]",

According to the problem, the group produces an additional chair every 6 hours. Therefore, in 6 hours, the group will produce:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ chair} \\]\n\nAdding the chairs produced by the workers and the additional chair produced by the group, we get the total number of chairs produced after 6 hours:\n\\[ 72 \\text{ chairs} + 1 \\text{ chair} = 73 \\text{ chairs} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of chairs produced after 6 hours is:\n\\[ \\boxed{73} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of chairs produced by the three workers after 6 hours, we need to consider both the individual production rates of the workers and the additional chairs produced as a group.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of chairs produced by each worker in 6 hours. Since each worker produces 4 chairs per hour, the number of chairs produced by one worker in 6 hours is:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ chairs/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 24 \\text{ chairs} \\]\n\nSince there are three workers, the total number of chairs produced by all three workers in 6 hours is:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ workers} \\times 24 \\text{ chairs/worker} = 72 \\text{ chairs} \\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the additional chair produced as a group every 6 hours.
