Calculate the number of egg sacs we are considering.\n2. Determine the number of baby tarantulas in these egg sacs.\n3. Calculate the total number of legs for all the baby tarantulas.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of egg sacs we are considering.**\n\nWe are given that we need to find the number of baby tarantula legs in one less than 5 egg sacs. So, we subtract 1 from 5:\n\\[ 5 - 1 = 4 \\]\nThus, we are considering 4 egg sacs.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of baby tarantulas in these egg sacs.**\n\nEach egg sac contains 1000 baby tarantulas. Therefore, the total number of baby tarantulas in 4 egg sacs is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 1000 = 4000 \\]\nSo, there are 4000 baby tarantulas in 4 egg sacs.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of legs for all the baby tarantulas.**\n\nEach baby tarantula has 8 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs for 4000 baby tarantulas is:\n\\[ 4000 \\times 8 = 32000 \\]\nSo, the total number of baby tarantula legs in one less than 5 egg sacs is:\n\\[ \\boxed{32000} \\]"
