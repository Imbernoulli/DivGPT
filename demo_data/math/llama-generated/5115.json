Determine the time it takes for Terry to drive that total distance.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Terry drives in one day.**\n\nTerry drives from his home to his workplace and then back. The distance from his home to his workplace is 60 miles. Therefore, the total distance for a round trip is:\n\\[ 60 \\text{ miles} + 60 \\text{ miles} = 120 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the time it takes for Terry to drive that total distance.**\n\nTerry drives at a speed of 40 miles per hour. To find out how many hours it takes to drive 120 miles, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{120 \\text{ miles}}{40 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, Terry spends \\(\\boxed{3}\\) hours driving from home to the workplace and back."
