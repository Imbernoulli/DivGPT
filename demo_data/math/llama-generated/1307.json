So far, 30 attendees from company A have been registered; company B has twice the number of attendees of company A; company C has 10 more attendees than company A; company D has 5 fewer attendees than company C. If a total of 185 attendees have registered, how many attendees who registered are not from either company A, B, C or D?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "Let's denote the number of attendees from company A as \\( A \\). According to the problem, we know that:\n\n\\[ A = 30 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of attendees from company B.

        "To determine how many attendees who registered are not from either company A, B, C or D, we first need to calculate the number of attendees from each company.\n\n1. **Company A**: \n   - Given: 30 attendees\n\n2. **Company B**: \n   - Company B has twice the number of attendees of company A.\n   - Therefore, the number of attendees from company B is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 30 = 60\n     \\]\n\n3. **Company C**: \n   - Company C has 10 more attendees than company A.\n   - Therefore, the number of attendees from company C is:\n     \\[\n     30 + 10 = 40\n     \\]\n\n4. **Company D**: \n   - Company D has 5 fewer attendees than company C.\n   - Therefore, the number of attendees from company D is:\n     \\[\n     40 - 5 = 35\n     \\]\n\nNext, we sum the number of attendees from companies A, B, C, and D:\n\\[\n30 + 60 + 40 + 35 = 165\n\\]\n\nWe are given that the total number of attendees registered is 185. To find the number of attendees who are not from companies A, B, C, or D, we subtract the total number of attendees from companies A, B, C, and D from the total number of attendees registered:\n\\[\n185 - 165 = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of attendees who registered and are not from either company A, B, C, or D is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]"
