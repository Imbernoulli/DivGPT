He burned 30 calories per hour, so in 2 hours he burned:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ calories/hour} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 60 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of calories Jonah would have burned in 5 hours. He burned 30 calories per hour, so in 5 hours he would have burned:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ calories/hour} \\times 5 \\text{ hours} = 150 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between the calories burned in 5 hours and the calories burned in 2 hours:\n\\[ 150 \\text{ calories} - 60 \\text{ calories} = 90 \\text{ calories} \\]\n\nTherefore, Jonah would have lost \\(\\boxed{90}\\) more calories if he had run for five hours instead of two hours.",
