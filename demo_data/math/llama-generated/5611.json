Therefore, we can calculate the number of years his partner has been teaching as follows:\n\\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \\]\nSo, James's partner has been teaching for 30 years.\n\nNext, we add the number of years James has been teaching to the number of years his partner has been teaching to find the total combined experience:\n\\[ 40 + 30 = 70 \\]\n\nThus, their combined teaching experience is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",
