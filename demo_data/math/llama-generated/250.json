        "To find out how many combined feet the friends walked, we need to convert each distance to feet and then sum them up. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Convert Lionel's distance from miles to feet:\n   - We know that 1 mile = 5280 feet.\n   - Therefore, 4 miles = \\(4 \\times 5280 = 21120\\) feet.\n\n2. Convert Esther's distance from yards to feet:\n   - We know that 1 yard = 3 feet.\n   - Therefore, 975 yards = \\(975 \\times 3 = 2925\\) feet.\n\n3. Niklaus's distance is already in feet:\n   - Niklaus walked 1287 feet.\n\nNow, we sum up the distances in feet:\n\\[21120 + 2925 + 1287\\]\n\nFirst, add 21120 and 2925:\n\\[21120 + 2925 = 24045\\]\n\nNext, add 24045 and 1287:\n\\[24045 + 1287 = 25332\\]\n\nTherefore, the combined distance walked by the friends is \\(\\boxed{25332}\\) feet.",
