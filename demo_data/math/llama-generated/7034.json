        "To determine how many meters of ribbon are not used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the length of each part of the ribbon after Isaac cuts it into 6 equal parts.\n2. Determine the total length of ribbon used by Isaac.\n3. Subtract the length of ribbon used from the original length of the ribbon to find the length of ribbon not used.\n\nLet's start with the first step. The original length of the ribbon is 30 meters, and Isaac cuts it into 6 equal parts. Therefore, the length of each part is:\n\\[ \\frac{30 \\text{ meters}}{6} = 5 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many meters of ribbon Isaac used. He used 4 parts of the ribbon, and each part is 5 meters long. So, the total length of ribbon used is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 5 \\text{ meters} = 20 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the length of ribbon used from the original length of the ribbon to find the length of ribbon not used:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ meters} - 20 \\text{ meters} = 10 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of meters of ribbon that are not used is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]",

        "To determine how many meters of ribbon are not used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the length of each part of the ribbon:**\n   Isaac cut his 30 meters ribbon into 6 equal parts. Therefore, the length of each part is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30 \\text{ meters}}{6} = 5 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the total length of the ribbon used:**\n   Isaac used 4 parts of the ribbon. Since each part is 5 meters long, the total length of the ribbon used is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ parts} \\times 5 \\text{ meters per part} = 20 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the length of the ribbon not used:**\n   To find out how many meters of ribbon are not used, we subtract the total length of the ribbon used from the original length of the ribbon:\n   \\[\n   30 \\text{ meters} - 20 \\text{ meters} = 10 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of meters of ribbon that are not used is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
        "To determine how many meters of ribbon Isaac has not used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the length of each part of the ribbon:**\n   Isaac cut his 30 meters ribbon into 6 equal parts.

        "To determine how many meters of ribbon are not used, we start by finding the length of each part of the ribbon after Isaac cuts it into 6 equal parts. The total length of the ribbon is 30 meters, so we divide 30 by 6:\n\n\\[\n30 \\div 6 = 5\n\\]\n\nThis means each part of the ribbon is 5 meters long. Next, we need to find out how many meters of ribbon Isaac used. He used 4 parts, so we multiply the length of each part by 4:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 4 = 20\n\\]\n\nThis means Isaac used 20 meters of ribbon. To find out how many meters of ribbon are not used, we subtract the length of the ribbon used from the total length of the ribbon:\n\n\\[\n30 - 20 = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of meters of ribbon that are not used is \\boxed{10}."
