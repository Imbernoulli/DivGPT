        "To determine the total number of yolks in the carton, we need to consider the number of eggs with double yolks and the number of eggs with single yolks.\n\n1. Identify the number of eggs with double yolks and their total number of yolks:\n   - There are 5 eggs with double yolks.\n   - Each of these eggs has 2 yolks.\n   - Therefore, the total number of yolks from the double yolk eggs is \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\).\n\n2. Identify the number of eggs with single yolks and their total number of yolks:\n   - There are 12 eggs in total, and 5 of them have double yolks.\n   - Therefore, the number of eggs with single yolks is \\(12 - 5 = 7\\).\n   - Each of these eggs has 1 yolk.\n   - Therefore, the total number of yolks from the single yolk eggs is \\(7 \\times 1 = 7\\).\n\n3.
