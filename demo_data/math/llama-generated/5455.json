        "To determine the total number of steps Raine takes walking to and from school in five days, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of steps Raine takes in one day. She walks to school and back home, so she takes 150 steps to school and 150 steps back home. Therefore, the total number of steps in one day is:\n\\[ 150 + 150 = 300 \\text{ steps} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many steps she takes in five days. Since she takes 300 steps each day, we multiply the number of steps per day by the number of days:\n\\[ 300 \\times 5 = 1500 \\text{ steps} \\]\n\nThus, the total number of steps Raine takes walking to and from school in five days is \\(\\boxed{1500}\\).",
