        "To determine Noah's age after 10 years, we start by finding Noah's current age. According to the problem, Noah's age is twice Joe's age. Since Joe is currently 6 years old, we calculate Noah's current age as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Noah's current age} = 2 \\times \\text{Joe's current age} = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\text{ years old}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how old Noah will be after 10 years. We do this by adding 10 years to Noah's current age:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Noah's age after 10 years} = \\text{Noah's current age} + 10 = 12 + 10 = 22 \\text{ years old}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Noah will be \\boxed{22} years old after 10 years.",

        "To determine Noah's age after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find Noah's current age.\n2. Calculate Noah's age after 10 years.\n\nFirst, we know that Noah's age is twice Joe's age. Since Joe is 6 years old, we can calculate Noah's current age as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Noah's current age} = 2 \\times \\text{Joe's age} = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how old Noah will be after 10 years. We do this by adding 10 years to Noah's current age:\n\\[ \\text{Noah's age after 10 years} = \\text{Noah's current age} + 10 = 12 + 10 = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, Noah will be \\boxed{22} years old after 10 years."
