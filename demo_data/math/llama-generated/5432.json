        "To determine how many more black female pigeons there are than black male pigeons, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of black pigeons.\n2. Determine the number of black male pigeons.\n3. Determine the number of black female pigeons.\n4. Find the difference between the number of black female pigeons and black male pigeons.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of black pigeons. Since half of the 70 pigeons are black:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of black pigeons} = \\frac{70}{2} = 35\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the number of black male pigeons. Since 20 percent of the black pigeons are male:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of black male pigeons} = 0.20 \\times 35 = 7\n\\]\n\nThen, we determine the number of black female pigeons. Since the total number of black pigeons is 35 and 7 of them are male, the number of black female pigeons is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of black female pigeons} = 35 - 7 = 28\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the number of black female pigeons and black male pigeons:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 28 - 7 = 21\n\\]\n\nThus, there are \\(\\boxed{21}\\) more black female pigeons than black male pigeons.",
