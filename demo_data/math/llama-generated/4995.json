        "To determine the total number of cookies that Chris, Kenny, and Glenn have, we start by finding out how many cookies each boy has based on the information given.\n\nFirst, we know that Glenn has 24 cookies. According to the problem, Glenn has four times as many cookies as Kenny. Therefore, we can find out how many cookies Kenny has by dividing Glenn's cookies by 4:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cookies Kenny has} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Chris has half as many cookies as Kenny. Therefore, we can find out how many cookies Chris has by dividing Kenny's cookies by 2:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of cookies Chris has} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\nNow, we add up the number of cookies each boy has to find the total number of cookies:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of cookies} = \\text{Number of cookies Chris has} + \\text{Number of cookies Kenny has} + \\text{Number of cookies Glenn has} = 3 + 6 + 24 = 33\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of cookies that these three boys have is \\boxed{33}.",
        "To determine the total number of cookies that Chris, Kenny, and Glenn have, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find out how many cookies Kenny has:**\n   Glenn has four times as many cookies as Kenny.
