        "To determine the number of different passengers stepping on and off a train at the station within an hour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of trains that arrive at the station in one hour.\n2. Determine the number of passengers stepping off the trains in one hour.\n3. Determine the number of passengers stepping onto the trains in one hour.\n4. Add the number of passengers stepping off and the number of passengers stepping onto the trains to get the total number of different passengers.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of trains that arrive at the station in one hour. Since a train comes every 5 minutes, we divide 60 (the number of minutes in an hour) by 5:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{5} = 12\n\\]\nSo, 12 trains arrive at the station in one hour.\n\nNext, we determine the number of passengers stepping off the trains in one hour. Since each train leaves 200 passengers, we multiply the number of trains by 200:\n\\[\n12 \\times 200 = 2400\n\\]\nSo, 2400 passengers step off the trains in one hour.\n\nThen, we determine the number of passengers stepping onto the trains in one hour. Since each train takes 320 passengers, we multiply the number of trains by 320:\n\\[\n12 \\times 320 = 3840\n\\]\nSo, 3840 passengers step onto the trains in one hour.\n\nFinally, we add the number of passengers stepping off and the number of passengers stepping onto the trains to get the total number of different passengers:\n\\[\n2400 + 3840 = 6240\n\\]\nSo, the total number of different passengers stepping on and off a train at the station within an hour is \\boxed{6240}.",
        "To determine how many different passengers step on and off a train at the station within an hour, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of trains that arrive in an hour:**\n   Since a train comes every 5 minutes, we can find the number of trains in an hour by dividing 60 minutes by 5 minutes per train:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{5} = 12\n   \\]\n   So, there are 12 trains arriving in an hour.\n\n2. **Determine the number of passengers座位 on each train:**\n   Each train takes 320 passengers on and leaves 200 passengers off. Therefore, the total number of passengers involved in each train (both on and off) is:\n   \\[\n   320 + 200 = 520\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of passengers involved in all trains in an hour:**\n   Since there are 12 trains and each train involves 520 passengers, the total number of passengers involved in all trains in an hour is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 520 = 6240\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of different passengers who step on and off a train at the station within an hour is \\(\\boxed{6240}\\).",

Therefore, the total number of passengers stepping off all the trains in one hour is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 200 = 2400 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of passengers stepping on each train.**\n\nEach train takes 320 passengers. Therefore, the total number of passengers stepping on all the trains in one hour is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 320 = 3840 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of different passengers stepping off all the trains in one hour.**\n\nSince each passenger stepping off a train is unique, the total number of different passengers stepping off all the trains in one hour is 2400.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of different passengers stepping on all the trains in one hour.**\n\nSince each passenger stepping on a train is unique, the total number of different passengers stepping on all the trains in one hour is 3840.\n\n**Step 6: Add the total number of different passengers stepping off and stepping on the trains.**\n\nThe total number of different passengers stepping on and off a train at the station within an hour is:\n\\[ 2400 + 3840 = 6240 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6240} \\]",
