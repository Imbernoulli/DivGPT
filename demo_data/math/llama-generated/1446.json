        "To determine the total time the students spend in time-out, we need to calculate the number of time-outs for each infraction and then find the total time spent in time-out.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of time-outs for each infraction:\n1. The number of time-outs for running is given as 5.\n2. The number of time-outs for throwing food is 1 less than five times the number of time-outs for running. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 5 - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24\n   \\]\n   Therefore, there are 24 time-outs for throwing food.\n3. The number of time-outs for swearing is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the number of time-outs for throwing food. So, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times 24 = 8\n   \\]\n   Therefore, there are 8 time-outs for swearing.\n\nNext, we find the total number of time-outs by adding the time-outs for each infraction:\n\\[\n5 + 24 + 8 = 37\n\\]\n\nSince each time-out is 5 minutes, the total time spent in time-out is:\n\\[\n37 \\times 5 = 185\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total time the students spend in time-out is \\(\\boxed{185}\\) minutes.",
