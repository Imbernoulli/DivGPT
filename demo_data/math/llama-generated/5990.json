        "To determine how many milligrams (mg) of Tylenol James takes in a day, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of Tylenol James takes in one dose.\n2. Determine how many doses James takes in a day.\n3. Multiply the amount of Tylenol per dose by the number of doses per day.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of Tylenol James takes in one dose. Each dose consists of 2 tablets, and each tablet is 375 mg.\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ tablets} \\times 375 \\text{ mg/tablet} = 750 \\text{ mg}\n\\]\n\nSo, each dose is 750 mg.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many doses James takes in a day. Since he takes a dose every 6 hours, we divide 24 hours (the number of hours in a day) by 6 hours.\n\n\\[\n24 \\text{ hours} \\div 6 \\text{ hours/dose} = 4 \\text{ doses}\n\\]\n\nSo, James takes 4 doses in a day.\n\nFinally, we multiply the amount of Tylenol per dose by the number of doses per day to find the total amount of Tylenol he takes in a day.\n\n\\[\n750 \\text{ mg/dose} \\times 4 \\text{ doses} = 3000 \\text{ mg}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of Tylenol James takes in a day is \\boxed{3000} mg.",
