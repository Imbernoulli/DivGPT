        "Given that the sum and product of Elvie's age and Arielle's age total 131, and Elvie's age is 10, we need to find Arielle's age.\n\nLet's denote Arielle's age by \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we write the expressions for the sum and the product of their ages:\n- The sum of their ages is \\( 10 + x \\).\n- The product of their ages is \\( 10 \\times x = 10x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the sum of the sum and the product of their ages is 131.

        "Let's denote Elvie's age by \\( E \\) and Arielle's age by \\( A \\). According to the problem, Elvie's age is 10, so we have \\( E = 10 \\).\n\nThe problem states that the sum of their ages plus the product of their ages is 131. This can be written as:\n\\[ E + A + E \\cdot A = 131 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( E = 10 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 10 + A + 10 \\cdot A = 131 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we have:\n\\[ 10 + A + 10A = 131 \\]\n\\[ 10 + 11A = 131 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( A \\) by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 11A = 121 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( A \\) by dividing both sides by 11:\n\\[ A = \\frac{121}{11} \\]\n\\[ A = 11 \\]\n\nTherefore, Arielle is \\(\\boxed{11}\\) years old.",
