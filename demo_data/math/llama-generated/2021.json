This is way too much for him to eat, so he gave some of it away to his friends. His friend Terry took 8 bushels, while Jerry only took 3. He gave 12 bushels to his friend Linda, who runs a food pantry. His neighbor Stacy doesn't eat much corn, but she still accepted 21 ears of corn from him.

        "To determine how many ears of corn Bob has left, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bushels Bob gave away.\n2. Determine the total number of ears of corn Bob gave away.\n3. Subtract the total number of ears of corn given away from the total number of ears of corn Bob initially had.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of bushels Bob gave away:\n- Terry took 8 bushels.\n- Jerry took 3 bushels.\n- Linda took 12 bushels.\n- Stacy took 21 ears of corn, but since we need the total in bushels, we'll convert this to bushels. Each bushel contains 14 ears, so:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Stacy's ears in bushels} = \\frac{21}{14} = 1.5 \\text{ bushels}\n  \\]\n\nNow, add up all the bushels given away:\n\\[\n8 + 3 + 12 + 1.5 = 24.5 \\text{ bushels}\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the total number of ears of corn Bob gave away:\n- Terry took 8 bushels, which is:\n  \\[\n  8 \\times 14 = 112 \\text{ ears}\n  \\]\n- Jerry took 3 bushels, which is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 14 = 42 \\text{ ears}\n  \\]\n- Linda took 12 bushels, which is:\n  \\[\n  12 \\times 14 = 168 \\text{ ears}\n  \\]\n- Stacy took 1.5 bushels, which is:\n  \\[\n  1.5 \\times 14 = 21 \\text{ ears}\n  \\]\n\nNow, add up all the ears given away:\n\\[\n112 + 42 + 168 + 21 = 343 \\text{ ears}\n\\]\n\nFinally, subtract the total number of ears given away from the total number of ears Bob initially had:\n- Bob initially had 50 bushels, which is:\n  \\[\n  50 \\times 14 = 700 \\text{ ears}\n  \\]\n- The number of ears Bob has left is:\n  \\[\n  700 - 343 = 357 \\text{ ears}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the number of ears of corn Bob has left is \\boxed{357}.",

Since each bushel contains 14 ears of corn, we calculate the number of bushels Stacy took as follows:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{21 \\text{ ears}}{14 \\text{ ears/bushel}} = 1.5 \\text{ bushels}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we add up all the bushels given away:\n\\[\n8 + 3 + 12 + 1.5 = 24.5 \\text{ bushels}\n\\]\n\nNext, we convert the total number of bushels given away into ears of corn:\n\\[\n24.5 \\text{ bushels} \\times 14 \\text{ ears/bushel} = 343 \\text{ ears}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of ears of corn given away from the initial number of ears of corn Bob had. The initial number of ears of corn is:\n\\[\n50 \\text{ bushels} \\times 14 \\text{ ears/bushel} = 700 \\text{ ears}\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of ears of corn Bob has left is:\n\\[\n700 - 343 = 357\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ears of corn Bob has left is \\(\\boxed{357}\\).",
