        "To determine the number of boys in the Biology class, we start by finding out how many students are in the Biology class. The problem states that the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class.

Let's denote the number of boys in the Biology class by \\( B \\). Therefore, the number of girls in the Biology class is \\( 3B \\). The total number of students in the Biology class is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls, which we can express as:\n\n\\[\nB + 3B = 4B\n\\]\n\nWe already know that the total number of students in the Biology class is 100, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n4B = 100\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( B \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[\nB = \\frac{100}{4} = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of boys in the Biology class is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",

According to the problem, there are three times as many girls as boys in the Biology class. Therefore, the number of girls in the Biology class is \\( 3B \\).\n\nThe total number of students in the Biology class is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls. We can write this relationship as:\n\n\\[\nB + 3B = 100\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[\n4B = 100\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( B \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[\nB = \\frac{100}{4} = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of boys in the Biology class is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",

        "To determine the number of boys in the Biology class, we start by finding the total number of students in the Biology class. We know from the problem statement that the Biology class has half as many students as the Physics class. Since the Physics class has 200 students, we calculate the number of students in the Biology class as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students in the Biology class} = \\frac{200}{2} = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many boys and how many girls are in the Biology class. The problem states that there are three times as many girls as boys. Let's denote the number of boys in the Biology class by \\( B \\). Then, the number of girls in the Biology class is \\( 3B \\). Since the total number of students in the Biology class is 100, we can write the following equation:\n\n\\[\nB + 3B = 100\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[\n4B = 100\n\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( B \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n\\[\nB = \\frac{100}{4} = 25\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of boys in the Biology class is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
