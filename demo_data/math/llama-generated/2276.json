        "To determine the number of girls in the class, we start by understanding the ratio of boys to girls, which is given as 5:8. This means that for every 5 boys, there are 8 girls. Therefore, the total number of parts in the ratio is \\(5 + 8 = 13\\).\n\nWe know the total number of students in the class is 260. To find out how many students each part of the ratio represents, we divide the total number of students by the total number of parts:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students per part} = \\frac{260}{13} = 20\n\\]\n\nSince each part represents 20 students, and the number of parts corresponding to girls is 8, we can find the number of girls by multiplying the number of students per part by the number of parts for girls:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} = 8 \\times 20 = 160\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of girls in the class is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
        "To determine the number of girls in the math class, we start by defining the ratio of boys to girls, which is given as 5:8. This means that for every 5 boys, there are 8 girls.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio.

To find out how many students each part of the ratio represents, we divide the total number of students by the total number of parts in the ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{260}{13} = 20\n\\]\nThis means that each part of the ratio represents 20 students. Since the number of girls is represented by 8 parts of the ratio, we multiply the number of parts representing girls by the number of students each part represents:\n\\[\n8 \\times 20 = 160\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of girls in the class is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
        "To determine the number of girls in the class, we start by using the given ratio of boys to girls, which is 5:8. This means that for every 5 boys, there are 8 girls. The total number of parts in the ratio is \\(5 + 8 = 13\\).\n\nNext, we need to find out how many students each part of the ratio represents. Since the total number of students in the class is 260, we divide 260 by the total number of parts in the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students per part} = \\frac{260}{13} = 20\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that each part of the ratio represents 20 students. Since the number of girls corresponds to 8 parts of the ratio, we multiply the number of students per part by 8:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} = 8 \\times 20 = 160\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of girls in the class is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
