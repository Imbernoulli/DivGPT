        "To determine how many pebbles Marcus has now, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of pebbles Marcus has, which is 18.\n2. Marcus skips half of the pebbles across the lake. Therefore, we need to calculate half of 18:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{18}{2} = 9\n   \\]\n   So, Marcus skips 9 pebbles, leaving him with:\n   \\[\n   18 - 9 = 9\n   \\]\n   pebbles.\n3.

Subtract the number of pebbles skipped from the initial number:\n   \\[\n   18 - 9 = 9\n   \\]\n   So, Marcus has 9 pebbles left after skipping some.\n4. Freddy gave Marcus another 30 pebbles. Adding these to the 9 pebbles Marcus has now:\n   \\[\n   9 + 30 = 39\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pebbles Marcus has now is \\(\\boxed{39}\\).",
