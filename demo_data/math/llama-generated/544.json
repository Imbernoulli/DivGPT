        "To determine how long it will take Walter to cook all the hushpuppies, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of hushpuppies needed:**\n   Walter has 20 guests, and each guest will eat 5 hushpuppies.\n   \\[\n   20 \\text{ guests} \\times 5 \\text{ hushpuppies/guest} = 100 \\text{ hushpuppies}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the cooking rate:**\n   Walter can cook 10 hushpuppies in 8 minutes. To find the rate per hushpuppy, we divide the number of hushpuppies by the time it takes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10 \\text{ hushpuppies}}{8 \\text{ minutes}} = 1.25 \\text{ hushpuppies/minute}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total time required:**\n   To find the total time needed to cook 100 hushpuppies at a rate of 1.25 hushpuppies per minute, we divide the total number of hushpuppies by the cooking rate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{100 \\text{ hushpuppies}}{1.25 \\text{ hushpuppies/minute}} = 80 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Walter \\(\\boxed{80}\\) minutes to cook all the hushpuppies.",
