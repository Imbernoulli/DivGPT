One day, 500 people showed up and took 1 can of food each. Carla had to then restock 1500 more cans to keep up with demand. The next day, 1000 people showed up and took 2 cans of food each. Carla restocked again with 3000 cans of food this time. How many cans of food did Carla give away?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
