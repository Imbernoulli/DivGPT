        "To determine the total cost of the two shirts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of the first shirt.\n2. Use the information given to find the cost of the second shirt.\n3. Add the costs of both shirts to get the total cost.\n\nWe know that the first shirt costs $15 and it is $6 more than the second shirt. Let's denote the cost of the second shirt as \\( x \\). According to the problem, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 15 = x + 6 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 15 - 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 9 \\]\n\nSo, the second shirt costs $9. Now, we add the costs of both shirts to find the total cost:\n\\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the two shirts is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",

Add the costs of the two shirts together to get the total cost.\n\nLet's start with the information given:\n- The cost of the first shirt is $15.\n- The first shirt costs $6 more than the second shirt.\n\nIf we let the cost of the second shirt be \\( x \\) dollars, then according to the problem, the cost of the first shirt can be expressed as \\( x + 6 \\) dollars. Since we know the first shirt costs $15, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ x + 6 = 15 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ x = 15 - 6 \\]\n\\[ x = 9 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of the second shirt is $9. Now, we add the cost of the first shirt and the cost of the second shirt to find the total cost:\n\\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the two shirts is \\(\\boxed{24}\\) dollars.",
        "To determine the total cost of the two shirts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of the first shirt.\n2.
