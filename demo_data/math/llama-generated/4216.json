        "To determine the total number of marks Amaya scored in all the subjects, we need to find her scores in each subject step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find Amaya's score in Maths. According to the problem, she scored 1/10 less in Maths than she did in Music. Since she scored 70 in Music, we calculate her score in Maths as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Score in Maths} = 70 - \\frac{1}{10} \\times 70 = 70 - 7 = 63\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Amaya scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she did in Arts. Therefore, her score in Arts is:\n\\[\n\\text{Score in Arts} = 63 + 20 = 83\n\\]\n\nThe problem also states that she scored 10 marks more in Social Studies than she did in Music. Therefore, her score in Social Studies is:\n\\[\n\\text{Score in Social Studies} = 70 + 10 = 80\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the total number of marks she scored in all the subjects by adding her scores in Maths, Arts, Social Studies, and Music:\n\\[\n\\text{Total score} = 63 + 83 + 80 + 70 = 296\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of marks Amaya scored in all the subjects is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{296}\n\\]",

Since she scored 70 in Music, we can express her marks in Maths as:\n\\[ M = 70 - \\frac{70}{10} = 70 - 7 = 63 \\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\( M = 63 \\) into the equation \\( M = A - 20 \\) to find \\( A \\):\n\\[ 63 = A - 20 \\]\n\\[ A = 63 + 20 = 83 \\]\n\nNext, we know she scored 10 marks more in Social Studies than she scored in Music.

        "To determine the total number of marks Amaya scored in all the subjects, we need to find her scores in each subject step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Amaya scored 70 in Music. According to the problem, she scored \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) less in Maths than she scored in Music. Therefore, we can calculate her score in Maths as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Score in Maths} = 70 - \\frac{70}{10} = 70 - 7 = 63\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Amaya scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she scored in Arts.

        "Let's denote the marks Amaya scored in Arts as \\( A \\). According to the problem, she scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than she scored in Arts, so her marks in Maths can be expressed as \\( A - 20 \\).

Since she scored 70 in Music, her marks in Maths can be expressed as \\( 70 - \\frac{70}{10} = 70 - 7 = 63 \\).
