        "To determine how many touchdowns the Seattle Seahawks scored, we start by analyzing their total points and the points contributed by their field goals. The final score for the Seattle Seahawks was 37 points, and they scored 3 field goals. Since each field goal is worth 3 points, we calculate the total points from the field goals as follows:\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ field goals} \\times 3 \\text{ points per field goal} = 9 \\text{ points}\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the points from the field goals from the total points to find out how many points were scored from touchdowns:\n\n\\[\n37 \\text{ points} - 9 \\text{ points} = 28 \\text{ points}\n\\]\n\nSince each touchdown is worth 7 points, we divide the remaining points by the points per touchdown to find the number of touchdowns:\n\n\\[\n28 \\text{ points} \\div 7 \\text{ points per touchdown} = 4 \\text{ touchdowns}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of touchdowns the Seattle Seahawks scored is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

        "To determine the number of touchdowns the Seattle Seahawks scored, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.\n\nLet \\( t \\) be the number of touchdowns scored by the Seattle Seahawks. Each touchdown is worth 7 points, and the Seahawks scored 3 field goals, with each field goal worth 3 points. The total score for the Seattle Seahawks is given as 37 points. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total score as:\n\n\\[ 7t + 3 \\times 3 = 37 \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the points from the field goals:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 7t + 9 = 37 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate the term with the variable \\( t \\) by subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 7t = 37 - 9 \\]\n\\[ 7t = 28 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( t \\) by dividing both sides by 7:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{28}{7} \\]\n\\[ t = 4 \\]\n\nThus, the number of touchdowns the Seattle Seahawks scored is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
