Determine the number of cars washed based on the amount raised from washing cars:\n   Each car costs $5.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{35}{5} = 7\n   \\]\n   So, they washed 7 cars.\n\nTherefore, the number of cars Laura washed is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
        "To determine how many cars Laura washed, we start by calculating the total revenue generated from washing the SUVs and trucks.\n\nFirst, we calculate the revenue from washing the SUVs:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ SUVs} \\times \\$7 \\text{ per SUV} = 5 \\times 7 = \\$35\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the revenue from washing the trucks:\n\\[\n5 \\text{ trucks} \\times \\$6 \\text{ per truck} = 5 \\times 6 = \\$30\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the revenue from the SUVs and trucks to find the total revenue from these vehicles:\n\\[\n\\$35 + \\$30 = \\$65\n\\]\n\nWe know the total revenue raised is $100. Therefore, the revenue from washing the cars is:\n\\[\n\\$100 - \\$65 = \\$35\n\\]\n\nTo find the number of cars washed, we divide the revenue from the cars by the price per car:\n\\[\n\\$35 \\div \\$5 \\text{ per car} = 7\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of cars Laura washed is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
        "To determine how many cars Laura washed, we need to calculate the total amount of money raised from washing SUVs and trucks, and then subtract this from the total amount raised to find out how much was raised from washing cars.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the money raised from washing SUVs. Since each SUV is charged $7 and they washed 5 SUVs, the total amount raised from SUVs is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ SUVs} \\times 7 \\text{ dollars/SUV} = 35 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the money raised from washing trucks. Since each truck is charged $6 and they washed 5 trucks, the total amount raised from trucks is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ trucks} \\times 6 \\text{ dollars/truck} = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the money raised from SUVs and trucks to find out the total amount raised from these two types of vehicles:\n\\[ 35 \\text{ dollars} + 30 \\text{ dollars} = 65 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince the total amount raised from washing all the vehicles is $100, the amount raised from washing cars is:\n\\[ 100 \\text{ dollars} - 65 \\text{ dollars} = 35 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSince each car is charged $5, the number of cars washed is:\n\\[ \\frac{35 \\text{ dollars}}{5 \\text{ dollars/car}} = 7 \\text{ cars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cars Laura washed is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."
