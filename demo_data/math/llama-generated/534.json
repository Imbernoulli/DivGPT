        "To determine the total time it takes to groom 5 dogs and 3 cats, we start by calculating the time required for each type of animal separately.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time it takes to groom 5 dogs. Since it takes 2.5 hours to groom one dog, the time for 5 dogs is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 2.5 = 12.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the time it takes to groom 3 cats. Since it takes 0.5 hours to groom one cat, the time for 3 cats is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 0.5 = 1.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we add the time for the dogs and the time for the cats to get the total time in hours:\n\\[ 12.5 + 1.5 = 14 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSince we need the answer in minutes, we convert the total time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply the total time in hours by 60:\n\\[ 14 \\times 60 = 840 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it takes to groom 5 dogs and 3 cats is \\(\\boxed{840}\\) minutes.",

Calculate the time it takes to groom 3 cats.\n3. Add the two times together.\n4. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes to groom 5 dogs. Since it takes 2.5 hours to groom one dog, we multiply 2.5 by 5:\n\\[ 2.5 \\times 5 = 12.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the time it takes to groom 3 cats. Since it takes 0.5 hours to groom one cat, we multiply 0.5 by 3:\n\\[ 0.5 \\times 3 = 1.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we add the two times together to find the total time in hours:\n\\[ 12.5 + 1.5 = 14 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the total time from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 14 by 60:\n\\[ 14 \\times 60 = 840 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of minutes it takes to groom 5 dogs and 3 cats is \\(\\boxed{840}\\).",
