        "To determine how many men are seated on the bus, we start by finding out how many passengers are women and how many are men.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of women on the bus:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of women} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 48 = 32\n\\]\nNext, calculate the number of men on the bus:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men} = 48 - 32 = 16\n\\]\nNow, we need to find out how many men are standing. Since one-eighth of the men are standing, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of standing men} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 16 = 2\n\\]\nTherefore, the number of men who are seated is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of seated men} = 16 - 2 = 14\n\\]\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]",

Calculate the number of men who are seated.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of women on the bus.**\n\nThe bus has 48 passengers, and two-thirds of them are women.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of women} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 48 = 32\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of men on the bus.**\n\nSince the rest of the passengers are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of passengers.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men} = 48 - 32 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many men are standing.**\n\nOne-eighth of the men are standing.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men standing} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 16 = 2\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of men who are seated.**\n\nTo find the number of men who are seated, we subtract the number of men standing from the total number of men.\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men seated} = 16 - 2 = 14\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of men who are seated is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
        "To determine the number of men seated on the bus, we start by calculating the number of women and men on the bus.\n\nFirst, we find the number of women. Since two-thirds of the passengers are women, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of women} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 48 = 32\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of passengers:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men} = 48 - 32 = 16\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many of the men are standing. Since one-eighth of the men are standing, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men standing} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 16 = 2\n\\]\n\nTo find the number of men seated, we subtract the number of men standing from the total number of men:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of men seated} = 16 - 2 = 14\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of men seated is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
