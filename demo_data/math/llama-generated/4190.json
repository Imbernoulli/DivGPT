        "To determine how much money Alice paid for each acorn, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money Alice paid.\n2. Determine the price Alice paid per acorn by dividing the total amount by the number of acorns she purchased.\n\nFirst, we find out how much Alice paid. According to the problem, Alice paid nine times the price Bob paid. Bob paid $6000, so we multiply $6000 by 9:\n\\[\n6000 \\times 9 = 54000\n\\]\nTherefore, Alice paid $54000 in total.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much Alice paid for each acorn. Alice purchased 3600 acorns, so we divide the total amount she paid by the number of acorns:\n\\[\n54000 \\div 3600 = 15\n\\]\nThus, Alice paid \\(\\boxed{15}\\) dollars for each acorn.",
