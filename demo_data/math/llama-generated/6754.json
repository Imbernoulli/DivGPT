        "To find the average weight of Ishmael, Ponce, and Jalen, we need to determine the weight of each individual first. We know that Jalen weighs 160 pounds. According to the problem, Ponce is 10 pounds lighter than Jalen, so we can calculate Ponce's weight as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ponce's weight} = \\text{Jalen's weight} - 10 = 160 - 10 = 150 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Ishmael is 20 pounds heavier than Ponce, so we can calculate Ishmael's weight as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ishmael's weight} = \\text{Ponce's weight} + 20 = 150 + 20 = 170 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the weights of all three individuals, we can find the average weight by adding their weights together and then dividing by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average weight} = \\frac{\\text{Ishmael's weight} + \\text{Ponce's weight} + \\text{Jalen's weight}}{3} = \\frac{170 + 150 + 160}{3} = \\frac{480}{3} = 160 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThus, the average weight of the three is \\(\\boxed{160}\\).",
