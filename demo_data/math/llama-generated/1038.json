        "To determine the total price of Marion's and Stephanie's bikes, we start by calculating the value of Stephanie's bike. We know that Stephanie's bike is worth twice as much as Marion's bike. Since Marion's bike cost $356, we can find the value of Stephanie's bike by multiplying $356 by 2:\n\n\\[\n356 \\times 2 = 712\n\\]\n\nSo, Stephanie's bike costs $712. Next, we need to find the total price of both bikes by adding the cost of Marion's bike and the cost of Stephanie's bike:\n\n\\[\n356 + 712 = 1068\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total price of their bikes is \\boxed{1068}.",
