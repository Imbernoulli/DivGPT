        "To determine the total amount George paid for his visit to the movie theater, we need to calculate the cost of the nachos and then add it to the cost of the ticket.\n\n1. First, we find the price of the nachos. The nachos were half the price of the ticket. Since the ticket cost $16, we calculate the price of the nachos as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Price of nachos} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we add the price of the nachos to the price of the ticket to find the total amount George paid:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total amount paid} = \\text{Price of the ticket} + \\text{Price of the nachos} = 16 + 8 = 24\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount George paid for his visit to the movie theater is \\boxed{24}.",
        "To determine the total amount George paid for his visit to the movie theater, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the cost of the movie ticket.\n2.
