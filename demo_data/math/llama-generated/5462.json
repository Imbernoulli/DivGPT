        "To determine how old Teresa was when she gave birth to Michiko, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Michiko's current age.\n2. Subtract Michiko's current age from Teresa's current age.\n\nFirst, let's find out Michiko's current age. Morio was 38 years old when Michiko was born. Since Morio is currently 71 years old, we can calculate Michiko's age by subtracting 38 from 71:\n\\[ 71 - 38 = 33 \\]\nSo, Michiko is currently 33 years old.\n\nNext, we need to find out how old Teresa was when she gave birth to Michiko. Since Teresa is currently 59 years old, we subtract Michiko's current age from Teresa's current age:\n\\[ 59 - 33 = 26 \\]\nSo, Teresa was 26 years old when she gave birth to Michiko.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{26}\n\\]",

        "To determine how old Teresa was when she gave birth to Michiko, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Michiko's current age.\n2. Subtract Michiko's current age from Teresa's current age.\n\nFirst, let's find out Michiko's current age. We know that Michiko was born when Morio was 38. Since Morio is currently 71, we can calculate Michiko's age as follows:\n\\[ 71 - 38 = 33 \\]\nSo, Michiko is currently 33 years old.\n\nNext, we need to find out how old Teresa was when Michiko was born. Since Teresa is currently 59 and Michiko is 33, we subtract Michiko's age from Teresa's age:\n\\[ 59 - 33 = 26 \\]\nSo, Teresa was 26 years old when she gave birth to Michiko.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{26}\n\\]"
