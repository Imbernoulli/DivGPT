Calculate how many more hours Joanna needs to read to finish the book.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pages Joanna reads on Monday:\n\\[ \\text{Pages read on Monday} = \\text{Reading speed} \\times \\text{Hours read} = 16 \\, \\text{pages/hour} \\times 3 \\, \\text{hours} = 48 \\, \\text{pages} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of pages Joanna reads on Tuesday:\n\\[ \\text{Pages read on Tuesday} = \\text{Reading speed} \\times \\text{Hours read} = 16 \\, \\text{pages/hour} \\times 6.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 104 \\, \\text{pages} \\]\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of pages Joanna has read so far:\n\\[ \\text{Total pages read} = \\text{Pages read on Monday} + \\text{Pages read on Tuesday} = 48 \\, \\text{pages} + 104 \\, \\text{pages} = 152 \\, \\text{pages} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pages are left for Joanna to read:\n\\[ \\text{Pages left} = \\text{Total pages in the book} - \\text{Total pages read} = 248 \\, \\text{pages} - 152 \\, \\text{pages} = 96 \\, \\text{pages} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate how many more hours Joanna needs to read to finish the book:\n\\[ \\text{Hours needed} = \\frac{\\text{Pages left}}{\\text{Reading speed}} = \\frac{96 \\, \\text{pages}}{16 \\, \\text{pages/hour}} = 6 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, Joanna needs to read \\(\\boxed{6}\\) more hours to finish the book.",
