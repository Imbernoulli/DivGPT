        "To determine the total number of bottles in the box, we need to calculate the number of water bottles and the number of apple bottles separately and then add them together.\n\nFirst, we know that the box has 2 dozen water bottles. Since one dozen equals 12, we can calculate the number of water bottles as follows:\n\\[ 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\]\nSo, there are 24 water bottles.\n\nNext, we know that the box has half a dozen more apple bottles than water bottles. Since half a dozen equals 6, we can calculate the number of apple bottles as follows:\n\\[ 24 + 6 = 30 \\]\nSo, there are 30 apple bottles.\n\nTo find the total number of bottles in the box, we add the number of water bottles and the number of apple bottles:\n\\[ 24 + 30 = 54 \\]\nSo, the total number of bottles in the box is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",
