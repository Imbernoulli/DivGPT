        "To determine how much money Jericho will be left with after paying off all his debts, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find out how much money Jericho has initially.**\n   According to the problem, twice the money Jericho has is 60. Let's denote the amount of money Jericho has by \\( J \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   2J = 60\n   \\]\n   To find \\( J \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n   \\[\n   J = \\frac{60}{2} = 30\n   \\]\n   So, Jericho initially has $30.\n\n2. **Determine the amount Jericho owes to Annika and Manny.**\n   Jericho owes Annika $14. He also owes half as much to Manny. Since he owes Annika $14, he owes Manny:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{14}{2} = 7\n   \\]\n   So, Jericho owes a total of $14 to Annika and $7 to Manny.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jericho owes.**\n   Adding the amounts he owes to Annika and Manny, we get:\n   \\[\n   14 + 7 = 21\n   \\]\n   So, Jericho owes a total of $21.\n\n4. **Determine how much money Jericho will be left with after paying off all his debts.**\n   Subtract the total amount of money he owes from the amount of money he initially has:\n   \\[\n   30 - 21 = 9\n   \\]\n   So, after paying off all his debts, Jericho will be left with \\(\\boxed{9}\\) dollars.",

Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 2x = 60 \\]\nTo find \\( x \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ x = \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\]\nSo, Jericho has $30 initially.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jericho owes. He owes Annika $14 and he owes Manny half as much as he owes Annika. Since he owes Annika $14, he owes Manny:\n\\[ \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\]\nTherefore, the total amount of money Jericho owes is:\n\\[ 14 + 7 = 21 \\]\n\nAfter paying off all his debts, the amount of money Jericho will be left with is:\n\\[ 30 - 21 = 9 \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money Jericho will be left with is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
