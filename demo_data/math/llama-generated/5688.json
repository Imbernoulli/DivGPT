        "To determine how many deer each wolf needs to kill, we first need to calculate the total amount of meat required for the entire pack over the next five days. The pack consists of 4 wolves hunting and 16 additional wolves, making a total of:\n\n\\[4 + 16 = 20\\]\n\nwolves. Each wolf needs 8 pounds of meat per day. Therefore, the total amount of meat needed per day for the entire pack is:\n\n\\[20 \\times 8 = 160\\]\n\npounds of meat. Since the wolves won't hunt again for five days, the total amount of meat needed over this period is:\n\n\\[160 \\times 5 = 800\\]\n\npounds of meat. Each deer provides 200 pounds of meat.

Determine the total amount of meat needed for the pack for five days.\n3. Calculate how many deer are required to provide that amount of meat.\n4. Determine how many deer each hunting wolf needs to kill.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of wolves in the pack.**\n\nThe pack consists of 4 hunting wolves and 16 additional wolves.\n\\[\n4 + 16 = 20\n\\]\nSo, there are 20 wolves in total.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat needed for the pack for five days.**\n\nEach wolf needs 8 pounds of meat per day. Therefore, the total amount of meat needed per day for all the wolves is:\n\\[\n20 \\times 8 = 160 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\nSince the wolves won't hunt again for five days, the total amount of meat needed for five days is:\n\\[\n160 \\times 5 = 800 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate how many deer are required to provide that amount of meat.**\n\nEach deer contains 200 pounds of meat. Therefore, the number of deer needed is:\n\\[\n\\frac{800}{200} = 4\n\\]\nSo, the pack needs 4 deer to provide enough meat for five days.\n\n**Step 4: Determine how many deer each hunting wolf needs to kill.**\n\nThere are 4 hunting wolves, and the pack needs 4 deer. Therefore, each hunting wolf needs to kill:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{4} = 1\n\\]\nSo, each hunting wolf needs to kill \\boxed{1} deer.",
