Therefore, the total number of watermelons he uses each week is:\n\\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \\text{ watermelons per week} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for Jeremy to use up all 30 watermelons. We do this by dividing the total number of watermelons by the number of watermelons he uses each week:\n\\[ 30 \\div 5 = 6 \\text{ weeks} \\]\n\nSo, the watermelons will last for \\(\\boxed{6}\\) weeks.",
