The garbage company charges Mary $10 per trash bin and $5 per recycling bin every week, and Mary has 2 trash bins and 1 recycling bin. They're giving her an 18% discount on the whole bill before fines for being elderly, but also charging her a $20 fine for putting inappropriate items in a recycling bin.

        "To determine Mary's garbage bill, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the weekly cost of the trash bins and recycling bins.\n2. Determine the monthly cost before the discount and fine.\n3. Apply the 18% discount.\n4. Add the $20 fine for putting inappropriate items in a recycling bin.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the weekly cost of the trash bins and recycling bins:\n- The cost per trash bin per week is $10.\n- Mary has 2 trash bins, so the weekly cost for the trash bins is \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\) dollars.\n- The cost per recycling bin per week is $5.\n- Mary has 1 recycling bin, so the weekly cost for the recycling bin is \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) dollars.\n- Therefore, the total weekly cost is \\(20 + 5 = 25\\) dollars.\n\nNext, let's determine the monthly cost before the discount and fine. Since there are 4 weeks in the month, the monthly cost is \\(25 \\times 4 = 100\\) dollars.\n\nNow, we apply the 18% discount. The discount amount is \\(100 \\times 0.18 = 18\\) dollars. So, the monthly cost after the discount is \\(100 - 18 = 82\\) dollars.\n\nFinally, we add the $20 fine for putting inappropriate items in a recycling bin. The total bill is \\(82 + 20 = 102\\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, Mary's garbage bill is \\(\\boxed{102}\\).",

Find the final amount Mary has to pay.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the weekly cost for the trash bins and recycling bins:\n- The cost for trash bins per week is $10 per bin * 2 bins = $20.\n- The cost for recycling bins per week is $5 per bin * 1 bin = $5.\n- Therefore, the total weekly cost is $20 + $5 = $25.\n\nNext, we determine the monthly cost before any discounts or fines. Since there are 4 weeks in the month:\n- The monthly cost is $25 per week * 4 weeks = $100.\n\nNow, we apply the 18% discount to the monthly cost:\n- The discount amount is $100 * 0.18 = $18.\n- The cost after the discount is $100 - $18 = $82.\n\nFinally, we add the $20 fine for putting inappropriate items in a recycling bin:\n- The final amount Mary has to pay is $82 + $20 = $102.\n\nTherefore, Mary's garbage bill is \\(\\boxed{102}\\).",
