Recently, a lot of the customers have been ordering very mild curries and the chefs have been having to throw away some wasted ingredients. To reduce cost and food wastage, the curry house starts monitoring how many ingredients are actually being used and changes their spending accordingly. The curry house needs 3 peppers for very spicy curries, 2 peppers for spicy curries, and only 1 pepper for mild curries. After adjusting their purchasing, the curry house now buys the exact amount of peppers they need. Previously, the curry house was buying enough peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. They now buy enough peppers for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers does the curry house now buy?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many fewer peppers the curry house now buys, we need to calculate the total number of peppers they used to buy and the total number of peppers they now buy, and then find the difference between these two quantities.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of peppers they used to buy:\n- They used to buy enough peppers for 30 very spicy curries, and each very spicy curry requires 3 peppers. So, they bought \\(30 \\times 3 = 90\\) peppers for very spicy curries.\n- They used to buy enough peppers for 30 spicy curries, and each spicy curry requires 2 peppers. So, they bought \\(30 \\times 2 = 60\\) peppers for spicy curries.\n- They used to buy enough peppers for 10 mild curries, and each mild curry requires 1 pepper. So, they bought \\(10 \\times 1 = 10\\) peppers for mild curries.\n- Therefore, the total number of peppers they used to buy is \\(90 + 60 + 10 = 160\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of peppers they now buy:\n- They now buy enough peppers for 15 spicy curries, and each spicy curry requires 2 peppers.
