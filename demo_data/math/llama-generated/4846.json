        "To determine how many dollars of the laboratory's budget remained, we need to calculate the total cost of the flasks, test tubes, and safety gear, and then subtract that total from the budget.\n\nFirst, we know the cost of the flasks is $150.

The problem states that the cost of the test tubes is two-thirds of the cost of the flasks:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of test tubes} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 150 = 100\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate the cost of the safety gear. The problem states that the cost of the safety gear is half of the cost of the test tubes:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of safety gear} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 = 50\n\\]\n\nNow, we add up the costs of the flasks, test tubes, and safety gear to find the total expenditure:\n\\[\n\\text{Total expenditure} = 150 + 100 + 50 = 300\n\\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the total expenditure from the budget to find the remaining amount:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining budget} = 325 - 300 = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of dollars of the budget that remained is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
