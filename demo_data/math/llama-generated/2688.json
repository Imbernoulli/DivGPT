        "To determine the total number of koalas and kangaroos at Legoland, we start by finding out how many koalas there are. We know that there are 5 kangaroos for each koala. Given that Legoland has 180 kangaroos, we can set up the following ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5 \\text{ kangaroos}}{1 \\text{ koala}} = \\frac{180 \\text{ kangaroos}}{x \\text{ koalas}}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n5x = 180\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{180}{5} = 36\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 36 koalas at Legoland.

Since the ratio tells us there are 5 kangaroos for each koala, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{number of kangaroos}}{\\text{number of koalas}} = 5\n\\]\n\nLet \\( k \\) represent the number of koalas. Then we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{180}{k} = 5\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( k \\), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n180 = 5k\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( k \\) by dividing both sides by 5:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{180}{5} = 36\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 36 koalas. Now, we need to find the total number of animals by adding the number of kangaroos and the number of koalas:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of animals} = \\text{number of kangaroos} + \\text{number of koalas} = 180 + 36 = 216\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of koalas and kangaroos at Legoland is \\(\\boxed{216}\\).",

Since there are 5 kangaroos for each koala, we can find the number of koalas by dividing the total number of kangaroos by 5.\n3. Calculate the total number of animals by adding the number of kangaroos and the number of koalas.\n\nLet's start with the second step. We know that Legoland has 180 kangaroos. To find the number of koalas, we divide 180 by 5:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of koalas} = \\frac{180}{5} = 36\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the number of kangaroos and the number of koalas to find the total number of animals:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of animals} = \\text{Number of kangaroos} + \\text{Number of koalas} = 180 + 36 = 216\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of koalas and kangaroos at Legoland is \\boxed{216}.",

We know that Legoland has 5 kangaroos for each koala, and we are given that there are 180 kangaroos.\n\nFirst, we set up the ratio of kangaroos to koalas:\n\\[ \\text{Number of kangaroos} = 5 \\times \\text{Number of koalas} \\]\n\nLet's denote the number of koalas by \\( k \\).

Then we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{180}{k} = \\frac{5}{1}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), we cross-multiply:\n\n\\[\n180 \\times 1 = 5 \\times k\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n180 = 5k\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( k \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{180}{5} = 36\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 36 koalas. Now, we need to find the total number of koalas and kangaroos. We add the number of kangaroos and the number of koalas:\n\n\\[\n\\text{total number of animals} = \\text{number of kangaroos} + \\text{number of koalas} = 180 + 36 = 216\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of koalas and kangaroos at Legoland is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{216}\n\\]"
