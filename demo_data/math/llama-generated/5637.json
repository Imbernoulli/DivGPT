        "To determine how long it takes Tom to climb the hill, we start by finding out how long it takes Tom in minutes. We know that Elizabeth takes 30 minutes to climb the hill, and Tom takes four times as long as Elizabeth does. Therefore, we can calculate the time Tom takes as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time Tom takes} = 4 \\times \\text{Time Elizabeth takes} = 4 \\times 30 = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the time Tom takes from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time Tom takes in hours} = \\frac{120}{60} = 2 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThus, it takes Tom \\(\\boxed{2}\\) hours to climb up the hill.",

        "To determine how many hours it takes Tom to climb the hill, we start by finding out how long it takes Tom in minutes. We know from the problem statement that Tom takes four times as long as Elizabeth to climb the hill. Since Elizabeth takes 30 minutes, we can calculate Tom's time as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tom's time} = 4 \\times \\text{Elizabeth's time} = 4 \\times 30 = 120 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert Tom's time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide Tom's time in minutes by 60:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tom's time in hours} = \\frac{120}{60} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThus, it takes Tom \\(\\boxed{2}\\) hours to climb up the hill.",
