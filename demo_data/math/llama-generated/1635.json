        "To determine the number of yellow marbles Josh has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **找到 blue marbles的数量:**\n   Josh has three times as many blue marbles as red marbles. Given that there are 14 red marbles, we calculate the number of blue marbles as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of blue marbles} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of red marbles} = 3 \\times 14 = 42\n   \\]\n\n2. **计算 blue and red marbles的总数:**\n   We add the number of red marbles and blue marbles to find the total number of these two colors:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of red and blue marbles} = \\text{Number of red marbles} + \\text{Number of blue marbles} = 14 + 42 = 56\n   \\]\n\n3. **确定 yellow marbles的数量:**\n   The rest of the marbles are yellow. Since Josh has 85 marbles in total, we subtract the total number of red and blue marbles from the total number of marbles to find the number of yellow marbles:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of yellow marbles} = \\text{Total number of marbles} - \\text{Total number of red and blue marbles} = 85 - 56 = 29\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of yellow marbles is \\(\\boxed{29}\\).",

Find out how many yellow marbles are left after accounting for the red and blue marbles.\n\nFirst, we know that Josh has 14 red marbles. According to the problem, there are three times as many blue marbles as red marbles. Therefore, we calculate the number of blue marbles as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue marbles} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of red marbles} = 3 \\times 14 = 42\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how many yellow marbles there are.

Therefore, we calculate the number of blue marbles as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue marbles} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of red marbles} = 3 \\times 14 = 42\n\\]\n\nNext, we know the total number of marbles is 85. The total number of marbles is the sum of the red marbles, blue marbles, and yellow marbles. Let \\( y \\) represent the number of yellow marbles. We can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of marbles} = \\text{Number of red marbles} + \\text{Number of blue marbles} + \\text{Number of yellow marbles}\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n85 = 14 + 42 + y\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( y \\), we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\\[\n85 = 56 + y\n\\]\n\nThen, we isolate \\( y \\) by subtracting 56 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\ny = 85 - 56 = 29\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of yellow marbles is \\(\\boxed{29}\\).",

Therefore, we can calculate the number of blue marbles as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blue marbles} = 3 \\times \\text{Number of red marbles} = 3 \\times 14 = 42\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of red and blue marbles combined:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of red and blue marbles} = \\text{Number of red marbles} + \\text{Number of blue marbles} = 14 + 42 = 56\n\\]\n\nSince Josh has a total of 85 marbles, we can find the number of yellow marbles by subtracting the total number of red and blue marbles from the total number of marbles:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of yellow marbles} = \\text{Total number of marbles} - \\text{Total number of red and blue marbles} = 85 - 56 = 29\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of yellow marbles is \\boxed{29}.",

This total is the sum of the red marbles, blue marbles, and yellow marbles. Let's denote the number of yellow marbles by \\( y \\). We can write the equation for the total number of marbles as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of red marbles} + \\text{Number of blue marbles} + \\text{Number of yellow marbles} = 85\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n14 + 42 + y = 85\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( y \\), we simplify the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n56 + y = 85\n\\]\n\nThen, we isolate \\( y \\) by subtracting 56 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\ny = 85 - 56 = 29\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of yellow marbles is \\(\\boxed{29}\\).",
        "To determine the number of yellow marbles Josh has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of red marbles.\n2. Calculate the number of blue marbles based on the number of red marbles.\n3. Determine the number of yellow marbles by subtracting the number of red and blue marbles from the total number of marbles.\n\nStep 1: Identify the number of red marbles.\nJosh has 14 red marbles.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of blue marbles.\nThere are three times as many blue marbles as red marbles. Therefore, the number of blue marbles is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 14 = 42 \\]\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of yellow marbles.\nThe total number of marbles is 85. To find the number of yellow marbles, we subtract the number of red and blue marbles from the total number of marbles:\n\\[ 85 - 14 - 42 = 29 \\]\n\nThus, the number of yellow marbles is \\(\\boxed{29}\\).",
