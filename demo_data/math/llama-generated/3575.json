        "Let's determine the current age of the daughter. We know that 5 years ago, the mother was twice as old as her daughter. If the mother is currently 41 years old, then 5 years ago she was \\(41 - 5 = 36\\) years old. Let's denote the current age of the daughter as \\(d\\). Therefore, 5 years ago, the daughter was \\(d - 5\\) years old. According to the problem, 5 years ago the mother was twice as old as the daughter, so we can write the equation:\n\n\\[36 = 2(d - 5)\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\(d\\):\n\n\\[36 = 2(d - 5)\\]\n\\[36 = 2d - 10\\]\n\\[36 + 10 = 2d\\]\n\\[46 = 2d\\]\n\\[d = \\frac{46}{2}\\]\n\\[d = 23\\]\n\nSo, the daughter is currently 23 years old. To find out how old the daughter will be in 3 years, we add 3 to her current age:\n\n\\[23 + 3 = 26\\]\n\nTherefore, the daughter will be \\(\\boxed{26}\\) years old in 3 years.",
        "Let's denote the current age of the daughter as \\( D \\) and the current age of the mother as \\( M \\). We are given that the mother is 41 years old now, so \\( M = 41 \\).\n\nFive years ago, the mother's age was \\( M - 5 \\) and the daughter's age was \\( D - 5 \\). According to the problem, five years ago the mother was twice as old as her daughter, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ M - 5 = 2(D - 5) \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( M \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ 41 - 5 = 2(D - 5) \\]\n\\[ 36 = 2(D - 5) \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( D \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[ 18 = D - 5 \\]\n\nThen, we add 5 to both sides:\n\\[ D = 23 \\]\n\nSo, the daughter is currently 23 years old. To find out how old the daughter will be in 3 years, we add 3 to her current age:\n\\[ D + 3 = 23 + 3 = 26 \\]\n\nTherefore, the daughter will be \\(\\boxed{26}\\) years old in 3 years.",

Five years ago, the mother's age was \\( 41 - 5 = 36 \\) and the daughter's age was \\( d - 5 \\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:\n\n\\[\n36 = 2(d - 5)\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( d \\). First, we expand the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n36 = 2d - 10\n\\]\n\nThen, we add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with \\( d \\):\n\n\\[\n36 + 10 = 2d\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n46 = 2d\n\\]\n\nWe then divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( d \\):\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{46}{2} = 23\n\\]\n\nSo, the daughter is currently 23 years old. To find out how old the daughter will be in 3 years, we add 3 to her current age:\n\n\\[\n23 + 3 = 26\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the daughter will be \\(\\boxed{26}\\) years old in 3 years."
