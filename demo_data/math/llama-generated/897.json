        "To determine how many buttons Sue made, we need to follow the information given step by step.\n\nFirst, we find out how many buttons Kendra made. According to the problem, Kendra made 4 more than five times as many decorated buttons as Mari. Mari made 8 buttons, so we can calculate the number of buttons Kendra made as follows:\n\\[\n5 \\times 8 + 4 = 40 + 4 = 44\n\\]\nSo, Kendra made 44 buttons.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many buttons Sue made. The problem states that Sue made half as many buttons as Kendra. Since Kendra made 44 buttons, we can calculate the number of buttons Sue made as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{44}{2} = 22\n\\]\nSo, Sue made 22 buttons.\n\nTherefore, the number of buttons Sue made is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",
