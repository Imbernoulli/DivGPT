        "To determine the total cost of the beef tenderloin for Antoine's dinner party, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of meat needed.\n2. Determine the cost of the beef tenderloin based on the total amount of meat.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of meat needed.**\n\nAntoine is inviting 6 people over, and the butcher recommends 1/2 pound of meat per person. Therefore, we multiply the number of people by the amount of meat per person:\n\n\\[\n6 \\text{ people} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ pound per person} = 3 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the cost of the beef tenderloin.**\n\nThe beef tenderloin costs $15.00 per pound. To find the total cost for 3 pounds, we multiply the price per pound by the total number of pounds:\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ pounds} \\times 15 \\text{ dollars per pound} = 45 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost of the beef tenderloin for Antoine's dinner party is \\(\\boxed{45}\\) dollars.",
