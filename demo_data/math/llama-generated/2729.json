        "To determine how much money Randy had initially, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent over the course of a year and then add this amount to the $104 he had left at the end of the year.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of trips Randy made to the store in one year. Since he makes 4 trips each month and there are 12 months in a year, we have:\n\\[\n4 \\text{ trips/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 48 \\text{ trips/year}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of money Randy spent in one year. Since he spends $2 on each trip, we have:\n\\[\n48 \\text{ trips/year} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars/trip} = 96 \\text{ dollars/year}\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that after spending $96 over the year, Randy had $104 left in his piggy bank.
