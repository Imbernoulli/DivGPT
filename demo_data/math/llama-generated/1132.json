Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "To determine how many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of people on the first ship as \\( x \\).\n\nSince each subsequent ship has twice as many people as the previous one, the number of people on the second ship is \\( 2x \\), and the number of people on the third ship is \\( 4x \\).\n\nThe monster consumes one ship every hundred years, so over three hundred years, it consumes three ships. The total number of people consumed over three hundred years is the sum of the people on these three ships:\n\\[\nx + 2x + 4x = 7x\n\\]\n\nWe know from the problem statement that the total number of people consumed over three hundred years is 847. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n7x = 847\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{847}{7}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 121\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years is \\(\\boxed{121}\\).",
