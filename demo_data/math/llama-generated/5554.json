        "To determine how much Jane would spend if she bought 12 of the cheaper of the two fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then compare them.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of apples:\n- The stand advertises 10 apples for $2.\n- Therefore, the cost per apple is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2 \\text{ dollars}}{10 \\text{ apples}} = 0.2 \\text{ dollars per apple}\n  \\]\n- To find the cost of 12 apples:\n  \\[\n  12 \\text{ apples} \\times 0.2 \\text{ dollars per apple} = 2.4 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of oranges:\n- The stand advertises 5 oranges for $1.50.\n- Therefore, the cost per orange is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1.50 \\text{ dollars}}{5 \\text{ oranges}} = 0.30 \\text{ dollars per orange}\n  \\]\n- To find the cost of 12 oranges:\n  \\[\n  12 \\text{ oranges} \\times 0.30 \\text{ dollars per orange} = 3.6 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\nNow, we compare the costs:\n- The cost of 12 apples is $2.40.\n- The cost of 12 oranges is $3.60.\n\nSince apples are cheaper, Jane will spend $2.40 if she buys 12 apples.\n\nFinally, we convert this cost into cents:\n\\[\n2.40 \\text{ dollars} = 2.40 \\times 100 \\text{ cents} = 240 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\nThus, the amount Jane would spend in cents is \\(\\boxed{240}\\).",
        "To determine how much Jane would spend if she bought 12 of the cheaper of the two fruits, we need to calculate the cost per fruit for both apples and oranges and then compare the two.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost per apple. The stand is advertising 10 apples for $2. Therefore, the cost per apple is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\text{ dollars}}{10 \\text{ apples}} = 0.20 \\text{ dollars per apple}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost per orange. The stand is advertising 5 oranges for $1.50. Therefore, the cost per orange is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1.50 \\text{ dollars}}{5 \\text{ oranges}} = 0.30 \\text{ dollars per orange}\n\\]\n\nNow, we compare the cost per apple and the cost per orange. The cost per apple is $0.20, and the cost per orange is $0.30. Since apples are cheaper, Jane will buy apples.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost for 12 apples. The cost per apple is $0.20, so the total cost for 12 apples is:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ apples} \\times 0.20 \\text{ dollars per apple} = 2.40 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we convert the total cost from dollars to cents.
