Subtract the number of cans already loaded from the total number of cans packed to find out how many cans are left.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cans in all the cartons that have been packed. Since each carton contains 20 cans and there are 50 cartons, we multiply the number of cartons by the number of cans per carton:\n\\[ 50 \\text{ cartons} \\times 20 \\text{ cans/carton} = 1000 \\text{ cans} \\]\n\nNext, let's determine the total number of cans that have already been loaded on the truck. Since 40 cartons have been loaded and each carton contains 20 cans, we multiply the number of loaded cartons by the number of cans per carton:\n\\[ 40 \\text{ cartons} \\times 20 \\text{ cans/carton} = 800 \\text{ cans} \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of cans already loaded from the total number of cans packed to find out how many cans are left:\n\\[ 1000 \\text{ cans} - 800 \\text{ cans} = 200 \\text{ cans} \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cans of juice left to be loaded on the truck is \\(\\boxed{200}\\).",

Calculate the total number of cans in the cartons left to be loaded.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. The total number of cartons packed is 50.\n2. The number of cartons loaded on the truck is 40.\n3. The number of cartons left to be loaded is:\n   \\[\n   50 - 40 = 10\n   \\]\n4. Each carton contains 20 cans of juice. Therefore, the total number of cans in the 10 cartons left to be loaded is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 20 = 200\n   \\]\n\nSo, the number of cans of juice left to be loaded on the truck is \\boxed{200}.",
