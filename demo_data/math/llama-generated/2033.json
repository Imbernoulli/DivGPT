He started with 50 state quarters his parents gave him.  Over the next year he doubled this.  The following year he collected 3 each month.  The year after that he collected 1 every third month.  The year after that he lost a quarter of them when he misplaced his collection.  How many did he have left after losing some?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

He loses:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quarters lost} = \\frac{140}{4} = 35\n   \\]\n   Subtracting these from the quarters he already has:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quarters after losing some} = 140 - 35 = 105\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of quarters Phil has left after losing some is \\(\\boxed{105}\\)."
