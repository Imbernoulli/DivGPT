        "To find the total number of points Noa and Phillip scored to win the bowl, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify Noa's score.\n2. Calculate Phillip's score.\n3. Add Noa's score and Phillip's score together.\n\nFirst, we know that Noa scored 30 points. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Noa's score} = 30 \\]\n\nNext, we know that Phillip scored twice the number of points that Noa scored. Therefore, we can calculate Phillip's score by multiplying Noa's score by 2:\n\\[ \\text{Phillip's score} = 2 \\times \\text{Noa's score} = 2 \\times 30 = 60 \\]\n\nNow, we add Noa's score and Phillip's score together to find the total number of points they scored:\n\\[ \\text{Total score} = \\text{Noa's score} + \\text{Phillip's score} = 30 + 60 = 90 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of points Noa and Phillip scored to win the bowl is:\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]",

        "To determine the total number of points Tom and Phillip scored to win the bowl, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the points Noa scored.\n2.
