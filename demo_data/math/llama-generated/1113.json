        "To determine how many people are left relaxing on the beach, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of people left in the first row:**\n   - The first row initially has 24 people.\n   - 3 people get up to wade in the water.\n   - Therefore, the number of people left in the first row is:\n     \\[\n     24 - 3 = 21\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of people left in the second row:**\n   - The second row initially has 20 people.\n   - 5 people go to join the people wading in the water.\n   - Therefore, the number of people left in the second row is:\n     \\[\n     20 - 5 = 15\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of people in the third row:**\n   - The third row has 18 people.\n   - No one leaves this row.\n   - Therefore, the number of people left in the third row is:\n     \\[\n     18\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of people left relaxing on the beach:**\n   - Add the number of people left in each row:\n     \\[\n     21 + 15 + 18\n     \\]\n\n   - Perform the addition:\n     \\[\n     21 + 15 = 36\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     36 + 18 = 54\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people left relaxing on the beach is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).",

After 3 people get up to wade in the water, the number of people left in the first row is:\n   \\[\n   24 - 3 = 21\n   \\]\n\n2. For the second row, originally there are 20 people. After 5 people get up to wade in the water, the number of people left in the second row is:\n   \\[\n   20 - 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. For the third row, originally there are 18 people. Since no one from the third row gets up to wade in the water, the number of people left in the third row is:\n   \\[\n   18\n   \\]\n\nNow, we add the number of people left in each row to find the total number of people left relaxing on the beach:\n\\[\n21 + 15 + 18 = 54\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of people left relaxing on the beach is \\boxed{54}.",
