There are 10 sales professionals, and each salesperson sells 10 cars per month. Therefore, the total number of cars sold in one month is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ sales professionals} \\times 10 \\text{ cars per salesperson per month} = 100 \\text{ cars per month} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many months it will take to sell all 500 cars. Since 100 cars are sold each month, the number of months required to sell 500 cars is:\n\\[ \\frac{500 \\text{ cars}}{100 \\text{ cars per month}} = 5 \\text{ months} \\]\n\nThus, it will take \\(\\boxed{5}\\) months for the sales professionals to sell all of the cars."
