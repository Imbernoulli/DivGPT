Therefore, the total amount of food a bear eats in 3 weeks is:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ pounds/day} \\times 21 \\text{ days} = 1890 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many \"Victors\" worth of food this total amount is.**\nVictor weighs 126 pounds, so the number of \"Victors\" worth of food is:\n\\[ \\frac{1890 \\text{ pounds}}{126 \\text{ pounds/Victor}} = 15 \\text{ Hebrews} \\]\n\nThus, the bear would eat \\(\\boxed{15}\\) \"Victors\" worth of food in 3 weeks.",
