        "To determine the cost of each blue notebook, we start by calculating the total cost of the red and green notebooks that Mike bought.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cost of the red notebooks:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ red notebooks} \\times 4 \\text{ dollars per notebook} = 12 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the green notebooks:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ green notebooks} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per notebook} = 4 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the costs of the red and green notebooks to find the total amount spent on these notebooks:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ dollars} + 4 \\text{ dollars} = 16 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nMike spent a total of 37 dollars on all notebooks. Therefore, the amount spent on blue notebooks is:\n\\[\n37 \\text{ dollars} - 16 \\text{ dollars} = 21 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many blue notebooks Mike bought. We know he bought a total of 12 notebooks and already bought 3 red and 2 green notebooks. Thus, the number of blue notebooks is:\n\\[\n12 \\text{ notebooks} - 3 \\text{ red notebooks} - 2 \\text{ green notebooks} = 7 \\text{ blue notebooks}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the cost of each blue notebook by dividing the total amount spent on blue notebooks by the number of blue notebooks:\n\\[\n\\frac{21 \\text{ dollars}}{7 \\text{ blue notebooks}} = 3 \\text{ dollars per blue notebook}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of each blue notebook is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",
