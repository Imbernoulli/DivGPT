Therefore, we can calculate the number of animal stickers as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of animal stickers} = \\text{Number of flower stickers} - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 \\]\n\nNext, we add the number of flower stickers and the number of animal stickers to find the total number of stickers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total number of stickers} = \\text{Number of flower stickers} + \\text{Number of animal stickers} = 8 + 6 = 14 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of stickers Victor has is \\(\\boxed{14}\\).",
