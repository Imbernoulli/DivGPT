        "To find the area of the window, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the area of one glass pane.\n2. Multiply the area of one glass pane by the total number of panes in the window.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of one glass pane. The area \\(A\\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[ A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\]\nFor each glass pane, the length is 12 inches and the width is 8 inches. So, the area of one glass pane is:\n\\[ A = 12 \\times 8 = 96 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total area of the window by multiplying the area of one glass pane by the total number of panes. The window has 8 glass panes. So, the total area of the window is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Area} = 96 \\times 8 \\]\n\nTo calculate \\(96 \\times 8\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\\[ 96 \\times 8 = (100 - 4) \\times 8 = 100 \\times 8 - 4 \\times 8 = 800 - 32 = 768 \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the window is:\n\\[ \\boxed{768} \\text{ square inches} \\]"
