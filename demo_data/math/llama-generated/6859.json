        "To determine Yvette's final bill, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the ice cream sundaes.\n2. Calculate the tip.\n3. Add the tip to the total cost to get the final bill.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the ice cream sundaes:\n\n- Alicia's sundae: $7.50\n- Brant's sundae: $10.00\n- Josh's sundae: $8.50\n- Yvette's sundae: $9.00\n\nAdding these amounts together:\n\n\\[\n7.50 + 10.00 + 8.50 + 9.00 = 35.00\n\\]\n\nSo, the total cost of the ice cream sundaes is $35.00.\n\nNext, we calculate the tip. Yvette leaves a 20% tip on the total cost. To find 20% of $35.00, we multiply $35.00 by 0.20:\n\n\\[\n35.00 \\times 0.20 = 7.00\n\\]\n\nSo, the tip is $7.00.\n\nFinally, we add the tip to the total cost to get the final bill:\n\n\\[\n35.00 + 7.00 = 42.00\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Yvette's final bill is \\boxed{42.00}.",
