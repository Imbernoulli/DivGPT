Therefore, the amount she has left can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount left} = \\frac{3}{8}P - \\frac{3}{40}P\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set up the equation:**\n   We know that the amount left is $300, so:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{8}P - \\frac{3}{40}P = 300\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find a common denominator:**\n   To combine the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 40 is 40. Rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{8}P = \\frac{3 \\times 5}{8 \\times 5}P = \\frac{15}{40}P\n   \\]\n   So the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15}{40}P - \\frac{3}{40}P = 300\n   \\]\n\n6. **Combine the fractions:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15 - 3}{40}P = 300\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12}{40}P = 300\n   \\]\n   Simplify the fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{10}P = 300\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solve for \\( P \\):**\n   To isolate \\( P \\), multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\), which is \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\):\n   \\[\n   P = 300 \\times \\frac{10}{3}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P = 1000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total prize money that Rica's group won is \\(\\boxed{1000}\\).",

To find out how much she spent, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{8}P = \\frac{3}{40}P\n\\]\n\nRica's remaining money after spending \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of her share is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8}P - \\frac{3}{40}P\n\\]\n\nTo subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 40 is 40. So, we rewrite \\(\\frac{3}{8}P\\) as:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8}P = \\frac{3 \\times 5}{8 \\times 5}P = \\frac{15}{40}P\n\\]\n\nNow, we can subtract \\(\\frac{3}{40}P\\) from \\(\\frac{15}{40}P\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{40}P - \\frac{3}{40}P = \\frac{12}{40}P = \\frac{3}{10}P\n\\]\n\nWe know that Rica's remaining money is $300, so:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{10}P = 300\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( P \\), we solve for \\( P \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\):\n\\[\nP = 300 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = 1000\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total prize money that Rica's group won is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1000}\n\\]",

The least common denominator of 8 and 40 is 40. So, we rewrite \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) as \\( \\frac{15}{40} \\).

Therefore, the amount she spent is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{5} \\left( \\frac{3}{8}x \\right) = \\frac{3}{40}x \\]\n\nAfter spending this amount, she is left with $300. So, the amount she has left is:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{8}x - \\frac{3}{40}x = 300 \\]\n\nTo simplify the left side of the equation, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 40 is 40. So, we rewrite \\( \\frac{3}{8}x \\) as \\( \\frac{15}{40}x \\):\n\\[ \\frac{15}{40}x - \\frac{3}{40}x = 300 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{12}{40}x = 300 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{3}{10}x = 300 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{3}{10} \\), which is \\( \\frac{10}{3} \\):\n\\[ x = 300 \\times \\frac{10}{3} \\]\n\\[ x = 1000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total prize money that Rica's group won is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]"
