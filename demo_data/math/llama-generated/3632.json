        "To determine the total amount the guy paid, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the drill bits before tax.\n2. Calculate the tax amount.\n3. Add the tax amount to the original cost to get the total amount paid.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the drill bits before tax. The guy buys 5 sets of drill bits, and each set costs $6. Therefore, the total cost for the drill bits is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the tax amount. The tax rate is 10%, so we multiply the original cost by 10% (or 0.10):\n\\[ 30 \\times 0.10 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFinally, we add the tax amount to the original cost to get the total amount paid:\n\\[ 30 + 3 = 33 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount he paid is:\n\\[ \\boxed{33} \\]",

The tax rate is 10%, so we multiply the cost of the drill bits by 10% (or 0.10):\n\\[ 30 \\times 0.10 = 3 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the tax amount to the cost of the drill bits to get the total amount paid:\n\\[ 30 + 3 = 33 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount the guy paid is:\n\\[ \\boxed{33} \\]",
