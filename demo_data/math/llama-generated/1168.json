        "To determine Kaylin's age, we need to work step by step through the relationships between the ages of Kaylin, Sarah, Eli, and Freyja.\n\n1. We know Freyja's age is 10 years old.\n2. Eli is nine years older than Freyja. Therefore, Eli's age is:\n   \\[\n   10 + 9 = 19 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n3. Sarah is twice as old as Eli. Therefore, Sarah's age is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 19 = 38 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n4. Kaylin is five years younger than Sarah. Therefore, Kaylin's age is:\n   \\[\n   38 - 5 = 33 \\text{ years old}\n   \\]\n\nSo, Kaylin is \\(\\boxed{33}\\) years old.",
