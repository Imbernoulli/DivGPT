        "To determine the total number of fish caught by Jason, Ryan, and Jeffery, we start by defining the number of fish each person caught based on the given relationships.\n\n1.

Jeffery caught twice the number of fish that Ryan caught. Therefore, Jeffery caught \\( 2 \\times 3x = 6x \\) fish.\n\nWe are given that Jeffery caught 60 fish.
