        "To determine how many miles Richard has left to walk to reach New York City, we need to calculate the total distance he has already walked over the three days and then subtract that from the total distance between Cincinnati and New York City.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Richard walked on each day:\n- On the first day, Richard walked 20 miles.\n- On the second day, Richard walked 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. Half of 20 miles is 10 miles, and 6 miles less than 10 miles is 4 miles. So, Richard walked 4 miles on the second day.\n- On the third day, Richard walked 10 miles.\n\nNext, we sum the distances walked over the three days:\n\\[ 20 \\text{ miles} + 4 \\text{ miles} + 10 \\text{ miles} = 34 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThe total distance between Cincinnati and New York City is 70 miles. To find out how many miles Richard has left to walk, we subtract the distance he has already walked from the total distance:\n\\[ 70 \\text{ miles} - 34 \\text{ miles} = 36 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, Richard has \\(\\boxed{36}\\) miles further to walk to be in New York City.",

        "To determine how many miles Richard still has to walk to reach New York City, we first need to calculate the total distance he has already walked over the three days.\n\n1. On the first day, Richard walks 20 miles.\n2. On the second day, Richard walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. First, we calculate half of the distance he walked on the first day:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n   Then, we subtract 6 miles from this distance:\n   \\[\n   10 - 6 = 4 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n   So, Richard walks 4 miles on the second day.\n3. On the third day, Richard walks 10 miles.\n\nNext, we sum the distances walked over the three days:\n\\[\n20 + 4 + 10 = 34 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThe total distance from Cincinnati to New York City is 70 miles. To find out how many miles Richard still has to walk, we subtract the distance he has already walked from the total distance:\n\\[\n70 - 34 = 36 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Richard has \\(\\boxed{36}\\) miles further to walk to be in New York City.",
