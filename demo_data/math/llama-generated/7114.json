Add the total earnings of Jemma and Dorothy to find the combined total.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many frames Dorothy sold. Since Jemma sold 400 frames and she sold twice as many frames as Dorothy, we can calculate the number of frames Dorothy sold as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of frames Dorothy sold} = \\frac{400}{2} = 200\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the price at which Dorothy sells each frame. Since Dorothy sells the frames at half the price that Jemma sells them, and Jemma sells each frame for $5, we can calculate the price at which Dorothy sells each frame as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Price per frame for Dorothy} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.50 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total earnings for Jemma. Since Jemma sold 400 frames at $5 each, we can calculate her total earnings as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings for Jemma} = 400 \\times 5 = 2000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total earnings for Dorothy. Since Dorothy sold 200 frames at $2.50 each, we can calculate her total earnings as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Total earnings for Dorothy} = 200 \\times 2.50 = 500 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the total earnings of Jemma and Dorothy to find the combined total:\n\\[\n\\text{Combined total earnings} = 2000 + 500 = 2500 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Dorothy and Jemma made together from the sale of the glass frames is \\boxed{2500}.",

Since Jemma sells twice as many frames as Dorothy, the number of frames Dorothy sold is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of frames Dorothy sold} = \\frac{400}{2} = 200\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that Jemma sells each frame at $5. Since Dorothy sells each frame at half the price that Jemma sells them, the price at which Dorothy sells each frame is:\n\\[\n\\text{Price per frame for Dorothy} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the total revenue for Jemma:\n\\[\n\\text{Total revenue for Jemma} = 400 \\times 5 = 2000 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate the total revenue for Dorothy:\n\\[\n\\text{Total revenue for Dorothy} = 200 \\times 2.5 = 500 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we add the revenues of Jemma and Dorothy to get the total amount made together:\n\\[\n\\text{Total amount made together} = 2000 + 500 = 2500 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total amount made by Dorothy and Jemma together from the sale of the glass frames is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2500}\n\\]",
