        "To determine the total number of miles Amy biked over the two days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify how many miles Amy biked yesterday.\n2. Calculate how many miles Amy biked today.\n3. Add the miles biked yesterday to the miles biked today.\n\nFirst, we know from the problem statement that Amy biked 12 miles yesterday.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many miles Amy biked today. According to the problem, she biked 3 miles less than twice as far as she did yesterday. We can express this mathematically as:\n\\[ \\text{Miles biked today} = 2 \\times \\text{Miles biked yesterday} - 3 \\]\nSubstituting the value we know for the miles biked yesterday (which is 12):\n\\[ \\text{Miles biked today} = 2 \\times 12 - 3 = 24 - 3 = 21 \\]\n\nNow, we add the miles biked yesterday to the miles biked today to find the total number of miles biked over the two days:\n\\[ \\text{Total miles biked} = \\text{Miles biked yesterday} + \\text{Miles biked today} = 12 + 21 = 33 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of miles Amy biked in the two days is \\(\\boxed{33}\\).",

According to the problem, she biked 3 miles less than twice as far as she biked yesterday. We can express this mathematically as:\n\\[ \\text{Miles biked today} = 2 \\times \\text{Miles biked yesterday} - 3 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value for miles biked yesterday (which is 12):\n\\[ \\text{Miles biked today} = 2 \\times 12 - 3 = 24 - 3 = 21 \\]\n\nNow, we add the miles biked yesterday to the miles biked today to find the total:\n\\[ \\text{Total miles biked} = \\text{Miles biked yesterday} + \\text{Miles biked today} = 12 + 21 = 33 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of miles Amy biked in the two days is \\(\\boxed{33}\\).",
        "To determine the total number of miles Amy biked over the two days, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of miles Amy biked yesterday.\n2. Calculate the number of miles Amy biked today based on the given relationship.\n3.
