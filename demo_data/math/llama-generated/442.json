        "To determine how many more joggers Christopher bought than Alexander, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine how many joggers Tyson bought:**\n   Christopher bought 20 times as many joggers as Tyson. Given that Christopher bought 80 joggers, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times \\text{Tyson's joggers} = 80\n   \\]\n   Solving for Tyson's joggers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tyson's joggers} = \\frac{80}{20} = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many joggers Alexander bought:**\n   Alexander bought 22 more joggers than Tyson. Since Tyson bought 4 joggers, we can calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Alexander's joggers} = 4 + 22 = 26\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many more joggers Christopher bought than Alexander:**\n   Christopher bought 80 joggers, and Alexander bought 26 joggers.

        "To determine how many more joggers Christopher bought than Alexander, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine how many joggers Tyson bought:**\n   - We know that Christopher bought 20 times as many joggers as Tyson.\n   - Christopher bought 80 joggers.\n   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times \\text{Tyson's joggers} = 80\n     \\]\n   - Solving for Tyson's joggers:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Tyson's joggers} = \\frac{80}{20} = 4\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many joggers Alexander bought:**\n   - Alexander bought 22 more joggers than Tyson.\n   - Tyson bought 4 joggers.\n   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Alexander's joggers} = \\text{Tyson's joggers} + 22 = 4 + 22 = 26\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many more joggers Christopher bought than Alexander:**\n   - Christopher bought 80 joggers.\n   - Alexander bought 26 joggers.\n   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = \\text{Christopher's joggers} - \\text{Alexander's joggers} = 80 - 26 = 54\n     \\]\n\nThus, Christopher bought \\(\\boxed{54}\\) more joggers than Alexander.",
        "To determine how many more joggers Christopher bought than Alexander, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find out how many joggers Tyson bought:**\n   Christopher bought 20 times as many joggers as Tyson.

        "To determine how many more joggers Christopher bought than Alexander, we start by finding out how many joggers Tyson bought. We know that Christopher bought twenty times as many joggers as Tyson, and Christopher bought 80 joggers. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times \\text{number of joggers Tyson bought} = 80\n\\]\n\nSolving for the number of joggers Tyson bought, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of joggers Tyson bought} = \\frac{80}{20} = 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine how many joggers Alexander bought. Alexander bought 22 more joggers than Tyson. Since Tyson bought 4 joggers, we can calculate the number of joggers Alexander bought as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of joggers Alexander bought} = 4 + 22 = 26\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more joggers Christopher bought than Alexander.
