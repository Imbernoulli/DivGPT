        "To determine how many more pens Alex will have than Jane after a month, we need to calculate the number of pens Alex will have after four weeks (since a month typically has four weeks).\n\nWe start with the information that Alex has 4 pens in the first week. Every week her pen collection doubles. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pens Alex has each week as follows:\n\n- After the first week: \\(4\\) pens\n- After the second week: \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) pens\n- After the third week: \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\) pens\n- After the fourth week: \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\) pens\n\nSo, after four weeks, Alex will have 32 pens.\n\nWe are given that Jane will have 16 pens after a month. To find out how many more pens Alex will have than Jane, we subtract the number of pens Jane has from the number of pens Alex has:\n\n\\[32 - 16 = 16\\]\n\nTherefore, Alex will have \\(\\boxed{16}\\) more pens than Jane.",
