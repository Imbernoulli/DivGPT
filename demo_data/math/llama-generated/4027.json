        "To determine how many calories Bob ate, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of slices Bob ate.\n2. Determine the total calories from the slices he ate.\n\nFirst, we know that Bob ate half of the pizza. Since the pizza has 8 slices, we calculate half of 8:\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{2} = 4\n\\]\nSo, Bob ate 4 slices.\n\nNext, we know that each slice is 300 calories. Therefore, the total calories from the 4 slices is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 300 = 1200\n\\]\nSo, Bob ate 1200 calories.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1200}\n\\]",
