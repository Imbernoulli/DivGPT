        "To determine what percentage of his money Mo will spend on Valentine's Day cards, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of Valentine's Day cards Mo needs:**\n   Mo wants to give Valentine's Day cards to 60% of the 30 students.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of cards} = 30 \\times \\frac{60}{100} = 30 \\times 0.6 = 18\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the Valentine's Day cards:**\n   Each card costs $2, so the total cost for 18 cards is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 18 \\times 2 = 36\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the percentage of Mo's money spent on Valentine's Day cards:**\n   Mo has $40. To find the percentage he spends, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage spent} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total cost}}{\\text{Total money}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage spent} = \\left( \\frac{36}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.9 \\times 100 = 90\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mo will spend \\(\\boxed{90}\\) percent of his money on Valentine's Day cards.",

Determine the total cost of the Valentine's Day cards.\n3. Calculate the percentage of Mo's money that the total cost represents.\n\nFirst, we find out how many Valentine's Day cards Mo wants to buy. Since he wants to give a Valentine to 60% of the 30 students, we calculate:\n\\[\n0.60 \\times 30 = 18\n\\]\nSo, Mo wants to buy 18 Valentine's Day cards.\n\nNext, we calculate the total cost of the Valentine's Day cards. Since each card costs $2, the total cost is:\n\\[\n18 \\times 2 = 36\n\\]\nSo, the total cost of the Valentine's Day cards is $36.\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage of Mo's money that $36 represents. Mo has $40, so the percentage is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{36}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 90\n\\]\nSo, Mo will spend \\(\\boxed{90}\\) percent of his money on Valentine's Day cards.",
