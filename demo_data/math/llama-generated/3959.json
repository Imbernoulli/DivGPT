        "Let's denote the initial number of strawberry plants Mark planted as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of strawberry plants after 3 months. Since the number of plants doubles each month, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{After 1 month: } 2x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{After 2 months: } 2 \\times 2x = 4x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{After 3 months: } 2 \\times 4x = 8x\n\\]\n\nNext, Mark digs up 4 strawberry plants and gives them to his friend. So, the number of plants left after giving away 4 plants is:\n\\[\n8x - 4\n\\]\n\nWe are given that after giving away the 4 plants, Mark still has 20 strawberry plants. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\n8x - 4 = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we solve the equation step by step:\n\\[\n8x - 4 + 4 = 20 + 4\n\\]\n\\[\n8x = 24\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{24}{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the initial number of strawberry plants Mark planted is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
        "To determine how many strawberry plants Mark initially planted, we can work backwards from the information given. Let's denote the initial number of strawberry plants by \\( x \\).\n\n1. **After 3 months:**\n   - The number of strawberry plants doubles each month.\n   - Therefore, after 3 months, the number of plants is \\( x \\times 2^3 \\).\n   - Simplifying, this is \\( x \\times 8 \\).\n\n2. **After giving away 4 plants:**\n   - Mark digs up 4 strawberry plants and gives them to his friend.\n   - The number of plants left is \\( 8x - 4 \\).\n\n3. **Final number of plants:**\n   - According to the problem, after giving away 4 plants, Mark still has 20 strawberry plants.\n   - Therefore, we set up the equation: \\( 8x - 4 = 20 \\).\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Add 4 to both sides of the equation: \\( 8x - 4 + 4 = 20 + 4 \\).\n   - Simplifying, this is \\( 8x = 24 \\).\n   - Divide both sides by 8: \\( x = \\frac{24}{8} \\).\n   - Simplifying, this is \\( x = 3 \\).\n\nThus, the initial number of strawberry plants Mark planted is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
        "Let's denote the initial number of strawberry plants that Mark planted as \\( x \\).\n\n1. **First Month:**\n   - The number of strawberry plants doubles.\n   - Therefore, after the first month, the number of plants is \\( 2x \\).\n\n2. **Second Month:**\n   - The number of strawberry plants doubles again.\n   - Therefore, after the second month, the number of plants is \\( 2 \\times 2x = 4x \\).\n\n3. **Third Month:**\n   - The number of strawberry plants doubles once more.\n   - Therefore, after the third month, the number of plants is \\( 2 \\times 4x = 8x \\).\n\n4. **AfterAlbert flushes 4 plants:**\n   - Mark digs up 4 strawberry plants and gives them to his friend.\n   - Therefore, the number of plants left is \\( 8x - 4 \\).\n\nWe know that after these actions, Mark has 20 strawberry plants. So, we set up the equation:\n\\[\n8x - 4 = 20\n\\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Add 4 to both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     8x - 4 + 4 = 20 + 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     8x = 24\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 8:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{24}{8}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 3\n     \\]\n\nThus, the initial number of strawberry plants that Mark planted is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

        "To determine how many strawberry plants Mark initially planted, we need to work backwards from the information given. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Final number of plants after giving some away:**\n   Mark has 20 strawberry plants after giving 4 to his friend.\n\n2. **Number of plants before giving any away:**\n   Before giving away 4 plants, Mark must have had:\n   \\[\n   20 + 4 = 24\n   \\]\n   plants.\n\n3. **Number of plants after 2 months:**\n   The number of plants doubles twice in 3 months.
