Determine the total number of bandages Peggy used.\n3. Subtract the number of bandages used from the initial number of bandages.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many bandages were in the box before Peggy skinned her knees. The problem states that the box had 8 less than two dozen bandages. Since one dozen equals 12, two dozen equals \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\). Therefore, the box had \\(24 - 8 = 16\\) bandages initially.\n\nNext, we need to determine the total number of bandages Peggy used. She used 2 bandages on her left knee and 3 bandages on her right knee, so the total number of bandages used is \\(2 + 3 = 5\\).\n\nNow, we subtract the number of bandages used from the initial number of bandages to find out how many bandages are left in the box. The calculation is \\(16 - 5 = 11\\).\n\nThus, the number of bandages left in the box after Peggy finished putting bandages on her knees is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).",
