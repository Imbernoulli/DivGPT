        "To determine the total number of blueberries Miss Darlington has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of blueberries in one basket.\n2. Determine the total number of baskets.\n3. Calculate the total number of blueberries by multiplying the number of blueberries in one basket by the total number of baskets.\n\nFirst, we know that each basket contains 20 blueberries. Miss Darlington has 1 basket initially and picked 9 more baskets, so the total number of baskets is:\n\\[ 1 + 9 = 10 \\]\n\nNext, we multiply the number of blueberries in one basket by the total number of baskets:\n\\[ 20 \\times 10 = 200 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of blueberries Miss Darlington has is:\n\\[ \\boxed{200} \\]",
        "To determine the total number of blueberries Miss Darlington has, we start by calculating the number of blueberries in the additional 9 baskets. Since each basket contains 20 blueberries, we can find the total number of blueberries in these 9 baskets by multiplying 20 by 9:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 9 = 180 \\]\n\nNext, we add the blueberries from the initial basket to the blueberries from the 9 additional baskets. The initial basket contains 20 blueberries, so we add 20 to 180:\n\n\\[ 20 + 180 = 200 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of blueberries Miss Darlington has is \\(\\boxed{200}\\).",
