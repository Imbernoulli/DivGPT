Find the difference between the number of votes the third guy captured and the number of votes John captured.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of votes remaining after John has captured his votes:**\n   John captured 150 votes out of 1150. Therefore, the number of votes remaining is:\n   \\[\n   1150 - 150 = 1000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many votes James captured:**\n   James captured 70% of the remaining votes.

        "To determine how many more votes the third guy got than John, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of votes remaining after John's votes are accounted for.\n2. Determine how many votes James received.\n3. Calculate how many votes the third guy received.\n4. Find the difference between the third guy's votes and John's votes.\n\nLet's start with the first step. John中有 1150 votes. Therefore, the number of votes remaining after John's votes are accounted for is:\n\\[ 1150 - 150 = 1000 \\]\n\nNext, we know that James captures 70% of the remaining vote. So, the number of votes James received is:\n\\[ 1000 \\times 0.70 = 700 \\]\n\nNow, we can find out how many votes the third guy received by subtracting the votes received by John and James from the total number of votes:\n\\[ 1150 - 150 - 700 = 300 \\]\n\nFinally, we need to find the difference between the third guy's votes and John's votes:\n\\[ 300 - 150 = 150 \\]\n\nThus, the third guy got \\(\\boxed{150}\\) more votes than John.",
